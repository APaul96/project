proud land grew strong wanted along taught fight Taught win never thought could fail fight left seems man whose dreams deserted Ive changed face Ive changed name But one wants lose Dont give Cause friends Dont give Youre beaten yet Dont give know make good Though saw around Never thought could affected Thought wed last strange way things turn Drove night toward home The place born lakeside daylight broke saw earth The trees burned ground Dont give You still Dont give dont need much anything Dont give Cause somewhere theres place belong Rest head You worry much Its going alright When times get rough You fall back Dont give Please dont give Got walk cant take anymore Going stand bridge Keep eyes Whatever may come And whatever may That rivers flowing That rivers flowing Moved another town Tried hard settle For every job many men many men noone needs Dont give Cause friends Dont give Youre one Dont give reason ashamed Dont give You still Dont give Were proud Dont give,soul
waiting waiting lifetime sure waiting waiting lifetime serious alliance lies ahead Let every necessary word said Remembering blood weve shed Keep mind things must forget Beware tragedy left right center Dont allow hell earth enter Get rid damage head Remember theres enemy bed The jokes sure But wishes hopes come true sure Its sure blue sure Its past rich poor towards That hard encore Ive walked African sands like Kosan The original man lands sacred Battled Zulu tribes passion word play swam The Zambezi butt naked Seen sun rise east set west Plotted stars charts directions god manifest From peaks pyramids left tags dark gaves That gave humanity clues star gaze Ive seen snake shed skin like seasons change Ive seen world rearrange flash Now cash rape lands strictly wealth Its left stranded spiritual realm Headed mecca stopped spoke swahm tribes Chanted native dialects hill felt vibes Threw hands sky beat hard Drum horizon waited freedom come But ships keep sailing whips keep cracking wonder begin back tracking Solomonic dynasty read kebra took swift Across mains like riding zebra Ashante Draped robes royalty shona tribe blessed meacapo,soul
