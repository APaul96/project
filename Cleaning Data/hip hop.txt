I am in the Matrix and I just took the blue pill  
No ho shit, no fuckin' ho shit, just save that for your shit  
I don't need no fuckin' body, I run my own shit  
Like Soulja, I thought I told yah, you didn't listen  
Fieri, I'm in the kitchen, I'm a magician  
I'm on it, I'm like Macgyver, I'm Michael Meyers  
I kill careers and cut the lights off, this shit is frightenin'  
I knew it would end up like this, I'm fuckin' psychic

Young but I'm gettin' every single motherfuckin' thing  
I'm old, you gotta know  
I'm here to fuck with niggas souls, my heart is cold  
It's prolly cause I'm from the snow, with all my woes  
I know they wanna see me go, I'm on a roll  
I mean I'm back on this again, I'm here again  
You know the truth, this not pretend, I'm not your friend  
Not your guy, I'm not your buddy, show no lovin'  
I might go DeMarcus Cousins out in public  
I mean I'm back on this again, I'm here again  
I didn't do this fuckin' tape for CNN  
I am not tryna win awards, that shit looked forced  
It's nothin' like this

If you were worried about where  
I've been or who I saw or  
What club I went to with the homies  
Baby don't worry, you know that you got me

I'm at or who I saw or  
What club I went to with the homies

I'm so fucking dumb I wrote ""diamonds"" on my thumbs,  
It's a diamond on my dick so that's a diamond on her tongue,  
I can't feel you baby 'cause I'm romantically numb,  
Emotionally drained I came here just so I can come,  
There's nothing on the God's sun that I haven't done,  
I got a lot of problems gettin pussy just isn't one,  
Girls are like buses every 15 mins they run,  
Now they like potato chips I just cannot have one,  
And I might like you for a minute,  
But I don't like your friends in my business,  
And I feel like you don't deserve a visit,  
Cause you ain't in the kitchen when you want a whipping,

Uh uhhhhhhh,

I know you say you love me girl,

Uh, ok I'm all about it, all for it,  
I'm all-star team Jordan, small forward,  
I'm never putting up a shot unless it calls for it,  
No hesitation so I'm shooting if I draw for it,  
How, How? Fuck is up, now man I'm in this hoe,  
Life is moving fast, where the fuck do all these minutes go,  
Mixtape dropped then I started getting 10 a show,  
Now I get a hundred what the fuck you think I'm in it for,  
Young money forever, I bet Gudda, Jae and Mack agree,  
Fuck you to the haters that just spend their time attacking me,  
Shout out to your girlfriend nigga lately she distracting me,  
Wondering if I'm the best, Will I. Am, no Black Eyed Peas,  
Girls wanna fuck ya niggas, guy don't wanna be you,  
Lining up around the block so that they can get to see you,  
I feel like I'll find a wife exactly when I need to,  
You can say whatever girl but we just don't believe you,

I be hittin' all the spots that you ain't even know was there  
And you don't even have to ask twice,  
You could have my heart, or we could share it like the last slice  
Always felt like you were so accustomed to the fast life  
Have a nigga thinking that he met you in a past life  
Sweat pants, hair tied, chillin' with no make-up on  
That's when you're the prettiest, I hope that you don't take it wrong  
You don't even trip when friends say you ain't bringing drake along  
You know that I'm working I be there soon as I make it home

Magazine paper girl but money ain't the issue  
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial  
She call me the referee cause I be so official  
My shirt ain't got no stripes but I can make your pussy whistle  
Like the Andy Griffith theme song,  
And who told you to put them jeans on  
Double cup love, you're the one I lean on  
Feeling for a fix, than you should really get your fiend on  
Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot  
Every single show she out there reppin' like a mascot  
Get it from the back and make ya fuckin' bra strap pop  
All up in your slot till a nigga hit the jack pot

Is this gonna last? Your up on a pedastool  
Are we moving too fast?  
Feel like I'm in crazy competition with the past

Is anything I'm doing brand new?  
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new

Highly doubt this feeling is reversible  
Knowledge is pain and that is why it hurts to know  
That you attempt to hide, and put mistakes aside  
So I don?t ever question you and damn  
I can't even find, the perfect brush  
So I can paint what's going through my mind  
Racing against myself, but I'm a couple steps behind  
That's why I gotta ask, is anything I'm doing brand new?

"[Drake]  
All my exes live in texas like I'm george strait  
Or they go to georgia state where-  
Tuition is handled by some random nigga that live in atlanta  
That she only see when she feels obligated  
Admitted it to me the first time we dated  
But she was no angel, and we never waited  
I took her for sushi, she wanted to fuck  
So we took it to go, told them don't even plate it  
And we never talk too much after I blew up  
Just only 'hello' or 'happy belated'  
And I think I text her and told her I made it  
And that's when she text me and told me she prayed it  
And that's when I text her and told her I love it  
And right after texting, told her I'm faded  
She asked  
What have I learned since getting richer  
I learned working with the negatives could make for better pictures  
I learned hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture  
Even though it's fucked up, girl, I'm still fucking wit ya  
Damn, is it the fall  
Time for me to revisit the past  
It's women to call  
There's albums to drop, there's liquor involved  
There's stories to tell, we been through it all  
Interviews are like confessions  
Get the fuck up out my dressing room, confusing me with questions  
Like:  
  
[Bridge: lil wayne]  
Do you love this shit?  
Are you high right now?  
Do you ever get nervous?  
Are you single?  
I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?  
You getting money? You think them niggas you with is wit' you?  
And I say  
  
(And I say) hell yeah  
Hell yeah, hell yeah  
Fuckin' right  
Fuckin' right, all right  
(And we say) hell yeah  
Hell yeah, hell yeah  
Fuckin' right  
Fuckin' right, all right  
  
[Lil wayne]  
So much for being optimistic  
They say love is in the air, so I  
Hold my breath until my face turn purple  
Keep a few bad bitches in my circle  
My nuts hang like ain't no curfew  
Bitch if you wave, then I will surf you  
I flew jet, she flew commercial  
But we still met, later that night  
After my session, she came over  
I was aggressive, and she was sober  
I gave her pills  
She started confessing and started undressing  
And ask me to hold her  
And so I did, but that was last month  
And now she's texting me, asking for closure  
Damn  
She say this shit gon' catch up to me  
I keep tissue paper  
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table  
She say she hate that she love me  
And she wish I was average  
Shit, sometimes I wish the same  
And I wish she wasn't married  
Promises, I hope I never break 'em  
Met a female dragon, had a fire conversation but  
Interviews are like confessions  
Get the fuck up out my bedroom confusing me with questions like  
  
[Bridge:]  
Do you love this shit?  
Are you high right now?  
Do you ever get nervous?  
Are you single?  
I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?  
You getting money? You think them niggas you with is wit' you?

And my shit's so wet you gotta paddle in  
Gotta r-r-row, gotta row ya boat  
It's Pink Friday Records and OVO  
Done did the pop tour, I'm the realest still  
The best legal team so the deals is ill  
It's MAC, OPI, and a fragrance too  
Apparel, I'm dominating every avenue  
Cobblestone, good view, little gravel too  
Gotta pay for the entourage travel too  
'Cause I'm fl-fl-fly I'm flying high  
Ain't got time to talk, just hi and bye, bitch  
  
But baby, if you ask me to take a break  
I'll give it all away, don't care what the people say  
I'll be a million, billion, trillion miles away  
  
He asked my sign, I said a Sag'  
I'm a star, sheriff badge  
What's the point if I'm guarding?  
Double D up, hoes, Dolly Parton

I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so proud of you  
I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so proud of you  
I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so proud of you  
Everything's adding up, you've been through hell and back  
That's why you're bad as fuck and you know you are

Always hiding out in your New York condo  
Why you never come to where I stay?

Why are we wasting our relationship on a relationship?  
Why are we rushing and forcing it? This isn't making sense  
Why are we focused on things that don't even mean nothing, girl?  
Why can we not find the time and sit down and discuss it, girl?  
Let me at least tell you my side of things, man  
Aw man, aw man  
Aw, man  
  
[Verse]  
Me and you are playing house, start think that I'm losing touch  
Got a tight grip on ya now, maybe I should loosen up  
When I leave you and I go home, I start forgetting what it is  
Start to think I got to get it how I live  
We too busy for a wedding or a kid  
If I'm working then I know you working  
Keep in touch with other women, cause you make me nervous  
I empower girls that don't deserve it  
I don't mean to do that shit on purpose  
It's just that when I go home, I start forgetting what it is  
The dream is over, I get lost up in the 6

You don't ever come to where I stay  
You just rather stay up in your New York condo  
You don't ever come to where I stay

Why are we wasting our relationship on a relationship?  
You know how sticky these situation get

"Why do I feel so alone?  
Like everybody passing through the studio  
Is in character as if we acting out a movie role  
Talking bullshit as if it was for you to know  
And I don't have the heart to give these  
Bitch ass niggas the cue to go  
So they stick around kicking out feedback  
And I entertain it as if I need that  
I had a talk with my uncle and he agreed that  
My privacy about the only thing I need back but  
It's hard to think of them polite flows  
Mr. Fano Poloto suits are your night clothes  
And Jordan sweat suits are your flight clothes  
And you still make it even when they say your flight closed  
Eyes hurting from the camera phone light shows  
Life was so full  
Now this shit just being lipo'd  
Always said I'd say it all on the right track  
But in this game you only lose when you fight back  
Black diamond bracelets  
Showing you the basics  
I can't live and hold the camara  
Someone gotta tape this  
I make hits unlike a bitch  
That's married I ain't miss  
24 hours from greatness  
I'm that close  
Don't ever forget the moment  
You began to doubt  
Transitioning from fitting in to standing out  
Los Angeles Cabanas or Atlanta South  
Watchin' whole show  
Embarrassed to pull my camera out  
And my mother embarrassed  
To pull my Phantom out  
So I park about 5 houses down  
She say I shouldn't have it until I have the crown  
But I don't wanna feel the need to wear disguises around  
So she wonder where my mind is accounts in the minus  
But yet I'm rolling round the fuckin' city like your highness  
Got niggas reactin' without a sinus  
'Cause what I'm working with is timeless  
And promoters try to get me out to they club  
They say I have fun but I can't imagine how  
'Cause I just seen my ex-girl  
Standing with my next girl  
Standing with the girl that I'm fuckin' right now  
And shit could get weird unless they all down  
And so I stay clear  
  
We from a small town  
Everybody talks and everybody listen  
But somehow the truth just always comes up missing  
I've always been something that these labels can't buy  
Especially if they tryin' to take a peice of my soul  
And Sylvia be tellin' Tez ""Damn Drake fly""  
And he just be like ""Silly mother fucker I know""  
That was your bad  
How could you pass up on 'em?  
He just take them records  
And he gas up on 'em  
Wayne will prolly put a million cash up on 'em  
Surprised no one ever put your ass up on 'em  
Oh they did Po  
At least they tried to  
And that's what happens  
When you spitting what's inside you  
But slip up and shoot the wrong fucking video  
And they think they can market you  
However they decide to nahh  
But Forty told me to do me  
And don't listen to anybody that knew me  
'Cause to have known me would  
Mean that there's a new me  
And if you think I changed in the slightest  
Could of fooled me  
Boy in my city I'm da 2-3  
Drug dealers live vicariously through me  
I quit school and it's not because I'm lazy  
I'm just not the social type  
And campus life is crazy understand  
I could get money with my eyes closed  
Lost some of my hottest verses down in Cabo  
So if you find a Blackberry with the side scroll  
Sell that mothafucka to any rapper that I know  
'Cause they need it much more than I ever will  
I got new shit  
I'm gettin' better still  
Little niggas put my name in they verses  
'Cause they girlfriend put my ass on a pedestal  
Future said 'cause this 'Ye shit you better kill

Oh, and I'm back, dog  
Oh, you just went and turned your back, dog  
I thought that we were family  
You showed me that we can't be  
I gotta talk to God even though he isn't near me  
Based on what I got it's hard to think that he don't hear me  
Hittin' like that 30 on my jersey man I'm gifted  
Whole lot of sixes, but I'm still like  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
6 point star, Lion of the Judah  
All my niggas ain't off rockin' Gucci  
One do it then we all gotta do it  
Got the key, now the doors open and we all goin' through it  
Whole city at your head for the boy  
I ain't even gotta call no one for it

"[Chorus]  
I did it all on my own,  
Turned a chair to a throne,  
I'm a king in this world,

I put my whole city on,  
To some things that they never would've known,  
If I didn't,  
(Stunt hard)  
And every night is a premiere,  
If I ever disappear,  
Best believe I'm comin' back.

Got rich, went broke, and got rich again,  
On that same shit again,  
All I ever do is,  
(Stunt hard)  
  
(Drake):  
I tell her.  
I'm getting motherfuckin' busy.  
So many spins my records is motherfuckin' dizzy.  
Haters wanna turn to their girl and be like, ""Who Is He"",  
But I bet a million she tell you that's motherfuckin' Drizzy.  
And I'm focused on my survival.  
Keep an eye on the door, focus on my arrival.  
Who do you look up to when you're better then your idols.  
And how you 'posed to look when you do it with your eyes closed.  
I'm everything you just haven't become.  
I spend my time trying to outdo what hasn't been done.  
Now hopefully let them see,  
What they say that I'm gon' be,  
And if not our whole future does in the memory of me.  
Get your team in order, assembly is key.  
And all my niggas shut up at the mention of a plea.  
They rather be apprehended and keep quiet then to be,  
On the stand jeopardizing every inch of their loyalty.  
Pick a lane pick a lane. That's all I ever heard.  
But I'm just trying to swerve.  
Without hitting the curb.  
That's why I spend thousands on bottles so I can pop them.  
And take photos wit hater niggas and crop them.  
I am not them. I Photoshop them, out.  
'Cause they don't understand what I'm about.  
Yeah.  
The Chris Paul  
Of this fall,  
Sittin' this tall.  
I float high,  
Goodbye,  
I will miss y'all.

If I don't do nothin', Imma stunt my ass off.  
Money sittin' in the pocket, 'bout to get a passoff.  
And I smoke that shit that smell like when you take your cast off.  
And I got them beach bitches, like David Hasselhoff.  
Baby I'm an acrobat. Sweetie, I'm a stunt devil.  
You can't get on my level 'cause I am so unleveled.  
I'm a young rebel.  
And I got a baby face.  
I need a young pebbles.

Yeah!  
Me, Drake and Kid and you know it's trouble.  
We got 'em drownin' in the flow, you see 'em blowin' bubbles.

I stick my landin' in a freak drawers.  
I'll have her bouncin' back like Dominique Dawes.  
Yeah!  
But I ain't stuntin' these hoes  
I been pimpin' since Hulk Hogan was N.W.O.  
Yeah!  
I'm wild, Drizzy tough, and the Kid vicious.  
The three horseman, we just need Sid Vicious.  
Yeah!  
I'm on the cup of that tilt.  
And if you hatin' on me  
I'll say fuck you like wilt.  
Yeah!  
I'm a wild-erbeast. You're just a wilderbeast.  
My two fingers make a gun, shoot and kill ya peace.

Talkin' big big shit.  
I am rude,

I stunt hard. I stunt harder.  
Boy they call me Jackie Chan in New Orleans.  
I ball hard. So I'm a ball hogger.  
And I go hard and I dunk like Vince Carter.  
I hustle harder.  
I live in the Carter.  
I think forward,  
All I see is tomorrow.  
I need me.  
I'll turn your shop into a horror.  
So if you trying to see more  
Better feed me.  
I'm back on my grizzy like Izzy Efeger.  
Don't he look like a black grizzly in that black fur.  
And the feds will never get me,  
Like a backwards,  
Password,  
Black spur,  
Go some like Pacman, cats first.  
Vanilla Ice got 'em hangin' over the banister  
Ask her,  
Am I their man,  
Her answer,  
Is yes sir.

Childish as it seems it'll make it all better... Better  
Selfish as it is this just ain't about you no...  
Did me wrong eveytime we were together... Gether  
And that's why...

Dealing with a heart that I didn't break

You and all your girls in the club one time  
All so convinced that you're following your heart  
Cause your mind don't control what it does sometimes  
We all have our nights though, don't be so ashamed  
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know  
We know,  
You hate being alone, you ain't the only one  
You hate the fact that you bought the dream  
And they sold you one  
You love your friends but somebody shoulda told you somin' to save you  
Instead they say  
  
Know you've been hurt by someone else

"Yesterday when we were getting high, you were invited.  
You would've liked it. I-I know you all too well.  
I said that we could kiss the past goodbye,  
But you weren't excited, there's no way to fight it.  
You can stay but shawty here I go  
  
Uh, should I spend the weekend in Vegas?  
I'm living inside a moment, not taking pictures to save it.  
I mean, how could I forget? My memories never faded.  
I can't relate to these haters, my enemies never made it.  
I am, still here with who I started with.  
The game needed life, I put my heart in it.  
I blew myself up, I'm on some martyr shit.  
Carried the weight for my city like a cargo ship.  
Uh. I'm 23, with a money tree.  
Growing more too, I just planted a hundred seeds.  
It's ironic, 'cause my mother was a florist,  
And that's how she met my pops and now my garden is enormous.  
It's happening Penny Lane, just like you said.  
I avoided the Coke game, and went with Sprite instead.  
Uh huh, that's word to the millions that they putting up.  
I'm trying to do better than good enough.  
  
[Chorus]  
What am I afraid of? This is suppose to be what dreams are made of.  
But people I don't have the time to hang with,  
Always look at me and say the same shit (they say)  
You promised me you would never change.  
You promised me you would never change.  
  
Uh. Am I wrong for making light of my situation? Clap on.  
When 40 got some shit for me to snap on.  
Now that I'm on, I don't really want to worry about getting back on.  
I'm just trying to stay on, get my fucking buffet on.  
I heard they just moved my grandmother to a nursing home.  
And I be acting like I don't know how to work a phone.  
But hit redial you see that I just called, some chick I met at the mall,  
That I barley know at all and,  
Plus this woman that I messed with unprotected  
Texting saying that she wish she would've kept it.  
The one that I'm laying next to just looked over and read it.  
Man I couldn't tell you where the fuck my head is,  
I'm holding on by a thread it's,  
Like I'm high right now, the guy right now,  
And you can tell by looking in my eyes right now.  
That nothing really comes as a surprise right now,  
'cause we just having the time of our lives right now.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well all right. Uh. I live by some advices, girl Lisa told me.  
The other day, Lisa told that she missed the old me.  
Which made me question when I went missing.  
And when I start treating my friends different.  
Maybe it was the fast paced switch up.  
Or the two guns in my face during the stick up.  
Maybe cause the girl I thought I trusted was who set the whole shit up.  
Or the fact I haven't seen em since they locked Big Rich up.  
I know. At the same time I'm quick to forget.  
I'm bout to roll me up a blunt with my list of regrets.  
Burn it all, burn it all, I'm starting it fresh.  
Cause half the time I got it right I probably guessed.  
Did I just trade free time for camera time?  
Will I blow all of this money baby, Hammer Time?  
I just need some closure.  
Ain't no turning back for me I'm in till it's over.

And they try to make you out as a lie  
Symbolic cos you were just trying to please em'  
By using logic and reason  
It's a lose lose why even try  
When your ideas so frequently get rejected and people just get neglected  
And They never really know how to feel  
Phone calls is something that you're expecting  
For someone without ethics to try and make em a mill  
You never noticed the fact you might be working what I'm receivin' at first  
And niggas wanna say that you ain't around  
I mean there's always some blame to put on yourself (yourselves)  
Instead of claimin' that you couldn't help and maybe next time you were
(ain't) In town  
  
Chorus:  
You gonna try to try harder cos  
Try harder cos  
  
Try -Try-Try-Try  
  
And the managers make you circum to pressure  
And you spitin' the pressure than most of the rappers running the game  
Concerned that people who copy what's in the past  
And turn the profit to cash  
There's time I would have done it the same  
I mean I got me a range  
Also got me a guilty conscience  
That made you tell anybody I meet that I ran  
Sometimes I wish that I woulda' just chilled on the sneakers  
And watched the game from the bleachers  
Cos I'm really telling me what I spent  
In a house that I promised to get my mother  
Don't compensate for the other time  
I wasted late out at the club  
Instead of sitting in once a week for some dinner  
I working hard on the winner so this album is a labour of love  
You say as long as I'm staying out of the streets  
And just spending money on beats that  
She can rest without a toss and a turn  
Cos she know that my reputation perceives me  
And people watch me on tv  
That's exactly why I often get burned  
But I'm gonna try to.

Trying to imagine how it might sound  
If I just yelled out  
What if I kissed you right now  
Would it bring us any closer  
Take a weight off our shoulders  
Take me I'm yours  
And I don't really care who knows it  
Can you afford to be open with all these emotions  
If you were a secret how long could you keep it

I have to watch the road  
I swear that every car that passes has you in it  
I can't believe we're finished  
My life is movin' fast  
The time will often pass  
And something will remind me  
I can't put this behind me  
I thought you would've called by now, by now  
You could've had my all by now, by now  
It's been too many years for you to disappear  
And have me asking the question  
  
[Hook]  
I wonder whatever became of you  
Although, it's not that I'm surprised, it's not I didn't try  
It's not that I was frightened, of you  
Although, I said all goodbyes  
And, you had all your cries  
I wonder whatever became of you  
I wonder whatever became of you  
I wonder whatever became of you  
  
[Verse 2: dawn richard]  
I swear I heard you call  
But when I heard you'd gone  
I hate that I looked desperate  
You gone is like me naked  
I'm staring at your (?)  
Trying to make it last  
Keep looking close behind me  
My eyesight on a memory  
I thought you would've called by now, by now  
You could have all my love right now, by now  
Gave into my fears  
While you just disappeared  
That's why I'm asking this question...

I wonder whatever became of you  
I wonder whatever became of you  
I wonder whatever became of you  
  
[Verse 3: drake]  
I can't go to bed  
Thinking about my goals  
And how we used to say a goal is just a dream with a deadline  
Where did the other half of my heart go?  
Why am I in bed alone?  
How come when I drive by, it looks like you are never home?  
Do you even live there?  
Or did you take a u-haul?  
Too far, move off and not even tell me that you're gone?  
We were on fire  
Somehow that fire cooled off, burnt out  
I kept straight, but I wonder how you turned out  
  
[Hook]  
I wonder whatever became of you  
Although, it's not that I'm surprised, it's not I didn't try  
It's not that I was frightened, of you

And, you had all your cries  
I wonder whatever became of you  
I wonder whatever became of you

Till I get to shake the hand of the man that's blessin' us  
Yeah, I know these n-ggas miss the mean lyrics  
Kush got the room smellin' like teen spirit  
I asked kindly if no-one out here would bring there feet up  
Until I lose for now I'm the game's single leader  
I fly private so no-one tells me to bring my seat up  
And book a suite when me and your favorite singer meet up  
Who you like, tell me who it is  
Imma make sure that that women is the next one on my list  
I should call it a night but f-ck it I can't resist  
This one is for all my n-ggas from my city tryin to diss  
Without a responce from me you really fail to exist  
And I love to see you fail that feelin' there is the sh-t  
I swear, aghh p-ssy n-gga get your bread up  
Enjoy the seat that the steward just forced your ass to let up  
Why your scary ass lookin' down pick your head up  
No-one told you your disguise is the most ridiculous gettup  
With nose plugs in now I can smell a set up  
  
So your just wastin your time your just only makin me better  
Yeah I try to tell them don't judge me because you heard stuff  
Chasin' cash that's my brother from the surf club  
Damn that n-gga always kept it so hood  
Back when we would smoke good  
At the oakwoods  
And have girls fall through like coins in a couch  
Now we just f-ckin all the b-tches they warned us about  
Scared for the first time everything has clicked  
What if I don't really do the numbers they predict  
Considerin the fact that I'm the one that they just picked  
To write a chapter in history this sh-t has got me sick  
Lyrics courtesy of www.Killerhiphop.com  
But if I really do it don't expect to get a split  
Cause this truly is some sh-t I don't expect you all to get  
I'm nervous but I'm about to kill it cause they about to let the realist team
in  
Throwin up in a huddle n-gga Willie beamin  
Were still throwin touchdown passes  
And tore his frame glasses  
Hopin that someone catch it  
People say that oh drake we started to miss it  
But they need to be a little more specific man is this what yall want?  
And my best chris tucker impression  
Ducking your questions  
F-ck your suggestions  
Money gets all of my love and affection  
Cars all black like the cover of essence  
I'm allergic to comin in second

"Diamoexplainnds hang around my neck, the crib is all finished  
No love for these bitches I said this year it's all business  
It is a shame that a couple of 'em are off limits  
No offence to my nigga, it's just the industry is small  
We all lust for the same women  
You know the ones we saw before we came in it  
I know he ain't trippin'  
I know I got a couple things that lil' wayne dipped in  
Ain't ashamed to admit it, I be the same with it  
This shit is all about hits and misses  
The ones that you fuck and the ones that you wife up  
Don't let them fuck your life up  
  
Half a mill to perform, I can't let them fuck that shit up  
Plus I love the way my middle name looks when it's lit up  
Jim moore got me dressing like a leading man  
A little favour for a friend when I need a hand  
Young frank, suits cut right always  
Just got a couple warhol's for my hallways  
New verses crush the hood like I'm driving into something  
Bitches on the kid like I'm iverson of something  
Like a sixer, since I sold 680 in my first  
Drizzy drake, the only one that got the gift without the curse  
Swag!

Chances Are Most of the day you was lying around  
I made money that's why these girls eyeing me down  
By nineteen I might seem desitend for millions  
Promoters on my ass so I'm guessing they filled  
In I take q's from my big boy popz  
I'm the only young dude that the big boys watch  
They getting foul on the star  
But it's all eyes on me like I'm coppin some vows for the bar  
Get it guess not picture me not strive  
To land in the top ten slip in the top five  
Same thing in the top four trust I'm hot boy  
Maybe even the top three Trey you got me  
Now a day I peep they intrests  
Specialy when lifes bringing them pain and lately they been stressed  
Money making brothers should take notes  
See broke niggas is the problem and us is the scape goat  
Some body get the waiter they need a second plate a  
This knowledge if you aint got it you could catch it later  
My money then lovers seperate for I commit the date up  
I put a split in the middle then I seperater

When you ask why I'm hustlin' in the streets that's just who I be

And she lets nobody else in except for me  
If her basement is locked, then I swear she would agree  
I'm the only one she loves, there's no copy of the key

[Verse 2:]  
This lifestyle is foul this shit'll damage her  
Especially when you think nobody is understanding ya  
These girls groups with they overprotected managers  
Got paparazzi over my shoulders clickin they cam-er-a  
Snap snap snap until they runnin outta card space  
You remind me of Tony's sister in scarface  
Just take it easy on love and slow ya heart rate  
? Girl it's graces on top is such a hard place?  
Yea... But if you never even been there  
You kinda make sense why you dying of pretendin  
Spillin all ya drinks takin pictures of ya swimwear  
Head up in the clouds you survivin on the thin air  
I know that shit is exhausting girl  
And your mistakes are costing girl  
And maybe you don't need the help but I just wanna see for myself

And I'll be the only one she concerned with  
To the people that ignored me before this  
This one is for you as a song re-recorded  
Funny thing is, you just notice me now but I was here along  
Your vision's just been distorted  
I'm so [?] I live this, you ask me what the business  
And I write a sixteen and record it, uh  
The waiting is over I think music need it  
Drake cuttin his records without gettin weeded  
People in the South want it chopped and screwed, I got this dude  
They expectations Imma exceed it uh  
Like a singer with only backgrounds ya'll record it  
When it's done ya lyrics tend to mislead ish  
Finally here Imma star with the timing  
My swagger is chill, and my flow is reclining  
This for anybody that's searchin for cash, a purchase [?]  
You only get the dough when you grindin  
And so I grind like I'm listening to I Wayne  
My pain, you can experience through the rhyming boy!

"When a good thing goes bad it's not the end of the world  
It's just the end of a world, that you had with one girl

And it's all because she don't want things to change

So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you  
That's the wrong thing to do  
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you  
That's the wrong thing to do  
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you  
That's the wrong thing to do  
Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying  
And say I love you too  
  
But I need someone different  
You know it, oh ho, you know it  
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it  
I need someone different  
You know it, oh ho, you know it  
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it  
Something's been missing  
You know it, oh ho, she knows it  
Oh ho, I know it, we all know it  
I need someone different (oh ho, oh ho)  
  
We live in a generation of, not being in love, and not being together  
But we sure make it feel like we're together  
Cause we're scared to see each other with somebody else

And some charges, how the f-ck can I get her to Paris  
Luckilly, I'm the greatest my country's ever seen

"This is why I do this shit.  
I think they call this, uh, venting.  
  
Yea  
Look  
Uh  
  
This is me.  
Still the same.  
They want the hits.  
I play the game.  
No auto tune, but you can feel the pain.  
It all comes spilling out like I hit a vein.  
What up lil' braw.  
What up slumville.  
I hope you know that y'all the reason I have fun still.  
The fans thinking that we all signed for one mill.  
Equal opportunities rapping, that shit is unreal.  
That ain't how it works.  
That ain't that how it goes.  
And I been getting high to balance out the lows.  
And I could use a writer to balance my flows.  
But I never share my thoughts,  
This is all a nigga knows.  
And every time I try, it opens up my eyes.  
These verses are a chance to remembered and reprized.  
And I would be performing just as long as I'm alive.  
So every word I utter will be mine.  
  
Don't believe the lies.  
Look me in my eyes.  
Please don't be scared of me.  
Please don't be scared of me.  
I remember you.  
This feeling isn't new.  
So please don't be scared of me.  
Please don't be scared of me.  
  
Don't take this the wrong way but  
I never cried when Pac died.  
But I probably will when Hov does.  
And if my tears hold value,  
Then I would drop one for every single thing he showed us.  
And I'll be standing in a puddle.  
I stay away from niggas that could land me in some trouble.  
And Ima keep it honest.  
Am so tired of being subtle.  
It's just me, Forty, O, and Nich standing in a huddle.  
Staring at the members of my team.  
Who get questioned about they profit from this from million dollar scheme.  
Just know that am in debt for you defending all our dreams.  
I hope you tell your family this shit ain't what it seems.  
But yall the reason for a lot of my devotion.  
You know I spend money because spending time is hopeless.  
And know I pop bottles cause I bottle my emotions.  
At least I put it all in the open.  
  
Don't believe the lies.  
Look me in my eyes.  
Please don't be scared of me.  
Please don't be scared of me.  
I remember you.  
This feeling isn't new.  
So please don't be scared of me.  
Please don't be scared of me.  
Oh oh oh oh oh uh.  
  
Look.  
Fuck all y'all.  
We ignore feelings here.  
Premature millionaires.  
Welcome to my realest year.  
Yeah.  
I swear we making a killer here.  
I should be on top of the world here just chillin' here.  
Uh.  
But it's funny having fans.  
Who find you before anybody ever has the chance,  
And build you up so you could be the biggest in the game.  
And realize when your there, sometimes the shit don't feel the same.  
Yeah.  
And plus things are just so real at home  
People think I've changed just because my appeal's grown  
And now security follow me everywhere  
So I'm never actually am alone, I just always feel alone.  
I think I'm scared of what the future holds.  
I was wishing for some things and now am used to those.  
Every girl I meet thinks I'm fucking groupie hoes.  
The honesty of my music has left me too exposed.  
All my old friends think I got a new crowd.  
And people seem to notice every time I do smile.  
I guess that mean they come few and far between.  
Even though am living out what you would call the dream.  
Yeah.  
And my uncle ain't even messaging me.  
And him missing in my life is kind of messing with me.  
I hope this isn't one of those forever things.  
It's funny how money can change everything.  
  
Don't believe the lies.  
Look me in my eyes.  
Please don't be scared of me.  
Please don't be scared of me.  
I remember you.  
This feeling isn't new.  
So please don't be scared of me.  
Please don't be scared of me.

Truth over fame, you know I respect the blatant sh!t  
When I hear talkin', I just don't know what to make of it  
Hate is so familiar to me, I'm slowly embracing it  
Doesn't come natural, bear with me it could take a bit

Who coulda predicted love could strike now you stuck with me  
Damn I kept my wits about me luckily  
What happened between us that night it always seems to trouble me  
Now all of a sudden these gossip brags wanna cover me  
And you making it seem that it happened that way because of me  
But I was curious and I'll never forget it baby  
What an experience you coulda been the one but it wasn't that serious  
Their was smoke in the air before now its me clearing it  
That felt good, all and all I learned a lesson from it though  
You never see it coming you just get to see it go

Everything the same but it feels different  
My dad called me up knowing that I still listen  
And he's still got his foot out, guilt trippin'  
It's been years, though, I just learn to deal with it  
For real, me and my realtor we built up a better rapport  
Got my mother in a place with some better decor  
She searched the entire city I let her explore  
Ant now she's sayin' she's more lonely than every before  
How many of our parents' marriages lasted?  
I was only five, I bet I barely reacted  
I'm flying back home for the heritage classic  
Searchin' for that feeling, tell me where is the magic?  
Let's stay together 'til we're ghosts  
I want to witness love, I've never seen it close  
Yeah, but I guess I gotta find it first

And all I care about is my city, man I can't say it enough

Ok now we got some action  
Everything I said, it happened  
That boy light as Michael Jackson  
But off verses, he been blackin'  
Chasin' women a distraction  
They wan' be on TV right next to me  
You cannot be here right next to me  
Don't you see Riri right next to me?  
I hate a rapper especially  
They feel the same, but they hide it  
They just discuss it in private  
Don't get along man, we tried it  
What's the point in even tryin'?  
I hate a goofy especially  
They always dyin' to mention me  
They gotta die out eventually  
I cannot give you the recipe  
You know the game is sold separately  
Swear I just had an epiphany  
It cost me 50 at Tiffany's  
Shout out to Tiffany, Stephanie  
They used to always come check for me  
My enemies wanna be friends with my other enemies  
I don't let it get to me  
  
[Hook: Drake]  
Done  
Look what I've done in my life  
I had to count it and count it again  
To make sure the money was right  
They love to talk  
Me, I'm just dunning the hype  
Me, I'm just dunning the hype  
Me I'm just done, done, done, done, done  
  
[Verse 2: Drake]  
I don't take this shit for granted  
I do my own propaganda  
I feel like Juelz Santana  
Leg hangin' out the Phantom  
6 cold like Alaska  
Views already a classic  
Roy outta here like NASA  
Bustin' 1's out the plastic  
Her gram too poppin' to fuck her  
The chain too heavy to tuck it, I'm serious  
I feed my family with this  
So don't play with my money this summer, I'm serious  
I don't run out of material  
You shouldn't speak on me, period  
You try to give 'em your side of the story  
They heard it, but they wasn't hearin' it  
They feeling a way and won't hide it  
Niggas done being silent  
Don't get along man, we tried it  
What's the point of even tryin'?  
I hate a goofy especially  
They always dyin' to mention me  
They gotta go, they gotta go  
They gonna die out eventually  
I cannot give 'em no empathy  
I'ma have B's when I'm 70  
They cannot fuck with the legacy  
I don't know what else is left for me  
After this no one a threat to me  
My enemies wanna be friends with my other enemies  
I don't let it get to me  
  
[Hook: Drake]  
Done  
Look what I've done in my life  
I had to count it and count it again

Me, I'm just done in the hype

"[Chorus]  
Emotions in this game run deep  
So before these haters kill me in my sleep  
I'd like to say it's been a pleasure  
Reppin' 'til my last second through  
Done a lot of shit they'll never get to do  
I'd like to say it's been a pleasure  
Honored to be somebody they mention  
But before these niggas stop payin' attention  
I'll just say it's been a pleasure  
You'll never be somebody they need  
Tomorrow ain't guaranteed  
So tonight we gon' do it like this  
Oh, for the H-Town  
Tonight I'm gon' make some money go  
For the H-Town  
  
Ladies and gentlemen,  
You're now listenin' to the Dirty South trillionaire ('naire)  
Keepin' it trill in there, been here and he's still in there (there)  
Pay attention, it's the beginnin' of a new era (era)  
Get a little closer you can see the view clearer (view clearer)  
It's like Lasik but are basic  
Ebonics if you're hooked on chronic and you can taste it  
Trace it, recognize the real when ya face it  
Ball up in the club gettin white boy wasted  
One shot of Patron, then another one to chase it  
Put me to the test, I won't pass it I'll ace it  
Been so many places, up and down the interstate  
Cities that I've never been, wonderin' if they fin' to hate  
Step up in the spot, let 'em look me in the grill (grill)  
So they can see it for they self that I keep it trill (I keep it trill)  
I paid the cost to be the boss and left a tip  
So it's all good (good) don't even trip  
Believe me it's been a pleasure  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Man I've been all over the world  
Tryin' to tell 'em 'bout the trill and what we been through (through)  
What we already done and what we fin' do (do)  
What we got into, what we gettin' into (to)  
When ties 'bout to cut it closer than a Ginsu ('su)  
Roll through Atlanta, Birmingham, Alabama ('bama)  
Jacksonville to Jackson, Mississippi spittin' grammar (spittin' grammar)  
From Shreveport ('port) down to New Orleans ('leans)  
And all points in between just to get the cream (cream)  
Me and my ""II Trill"" team on the road flippin' (flippin')  
Eight hours straight, no stops, no trippin' (trippin')  
Had to keep them heaters on 'em so it's no slippin' (slippin')  
Promote a play with show money, we were slow grippin' (slow grippin')  
Sometimes we rock the stage and put it down (down)  
Other times we had to fight and shoot it out of town (town)  
But we always made it home okay  
And we still on the road to this day  
I gotta say it's been a pleasure  
  
[Chorus]  
  
They say that you never really know  
What you got 'til it's gone and can't touch it (touch it)  
If it look too good to be true, you can't trust it (trust it)  
If you never had it (had it) then you can never miss it (miss it)  
But looks can be deceivin', so don't you get it twisted (twisted)  
Walked a lot of miles in these old school J's (J's)  
Thought of many ways, lookin' at back in the days (days)  
Like how to climb from in between a rock, and a hard place  
How to keep your cool when you're dealin' with a hard case (with a hard case)  
And how to duck, when the judge throw the book at you (the book at you)  
And it's a two-sided mirror that you're lookin' through (you're lookin'
through)  
The phone receiver's in your hand starin at your child (child)  
And your heart skips a beat every time they smile (smile)  
See that's how real life is and how it can be (can be)  
And how it's deeper then just comin' down candy (candy)  
So I'm just tryin' to play the cards that they hand me  
For those that overstood me, understand me  
It's been a pleasure  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'd like to say it's been a pleasure  
I'll just say it's been a pleasure

"[Drake]  
Uhh, this verse starts as my snipers hit their marks  
And ya guards fall down from a rifle to the heart  
Like clap clap, let em fall slow  
I know you had you fears you can let them all go  
And most women are motivated so I act accordingly  
But this is so refreshing that it means a little more to me  
Dedicating time when I really can't afford to be  
I provide protection if you open up the door for me  
Couple stares, couple texts, couple dates  
Couple 'i think that we're ready's'  
Couple 'i think we should wait's'  
Are we acting like a couple, I'm just trying to get it straight  
Cause I'm over here convinced that it's too early for mistakes  
  
[Jhene Aiko - Chorus]  
You had to change up the game  
Oh the weather is not the same  
Now there's only cloudy days  
I can't stand the rain in July  
Oh July  
There were fireworks exploding (exploding)  
But now it's getting colder  
The leafs are turning colours  
Why, it's just not our season  
The one and only reason  
Baby oh baby oh  
When summer turn into fall  
  
[Drake - Verse 2]  
Damn, tell me where did all the magic go  
I follow all the rules and told you everything you had to know  
Had you over every night, every night was passionate  
Plus you met my mother even if it was an accident  
I'm confused tell me where we go wrong  
I wish shorty I would be with you so long  
I was planning on being something worth mentioning  
Energy invested in someone I saw potential in  
Who killed Chivalry they need to get their sentencing  
Meanwhile we argue and I can't get a sentence in  
And just as I predicted here we go again  
They always say the hottest love has the coldest end  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[Jhene Aiko]  
See it's funny cause I never thought this would end but then the season
changed  
[Drake]  
You are my, you are my, you are my girl (I was your girl)  
Shoulda made, shoulda made, shoulda made you my World  
Shoulda made you everything to make you happy baby  
[Jhene Aiko]  
Can't wait for, can't wait for, can't wait for springtime  
And I will turn into a butterfly  
I will spread my wings and fly  
And I'm too fly for the sh-t  
Ohhh, I am Japanese if you please

So tonight I'll just fuck you like we're in Houston  
Taking everything slow so slow, so slow but I do it to her  
  
Draped up and dripped out know what I'm talkin' 'bout  
Three in the morning get it poppin' in the parking lot  
It's on once again and I never pretend  
A nigga stay G till the end, yeah  
  
I swear like every time we find ourself in this situation  
I just get that feeling like I mean Houston candy paint  
Switching colors in the light, it's about like 11 P. M.  
And you just roaming through the city bumpin' that screw  
  
Big Mo, ugk, Lil Keke  
It feel like everything just moving slow  
Let's take my time, I pace it, baby  
Yeah, I'm gone

Lips on your neck  
We're never too close now  
Nothing like you and me  
I don't know your name  
But I'm sure that you know me  
A little life with the music  
The feeling is mutual  
Loving the way you move on me  
Skin so soft, hands on my face to be directed  
And you're all that I can see  
You give the baddest one in here a run for their money  
And when this song comes on, you know  
  
[Chorus: Justin Bieber]  
I need a one dance  
1942 in my hand  
One more time 'fore I go  
Body lockin', put a hold on me  
I need a one dance

One more time 'fore I go

You know, I like that you're wild  
So make your way over here right now  
We only got a little while  
Just thinkin' out loud  
Celebrate life with me babe  
Don't be in a rush to go now  
Oh girl

Bottles on me, long as someone drink it  
Never drop the ball, fuck are y'all thinkin'?  
Makin' sure the Young Money ship is never sinkin'  
'Bout to set it off, in this bitch, Jada Pinkett  
I shouldn't've drove, tell me how I'm gettin' home  
You too fine to be layin' down in bed alone  
I could teach you how to speak my language, Rosetta Stone  
I swear this life is like the sweetest thing I've ever known  
'Bout to go Thriller Mike Jackson on these niggas  
All I need's a fucking red jacket with some zippers  
Super good smiddoke, a package of the swishers  
I did it overnight, it couldn't happen any quicker  
Y'all know them? Well, fuck it, me either  
But point the biggest skeptic out, I'll make him a believer  
It wouldn't be the first time I done it, throwin' hundreds

One thing 'bout music, when it hits you feel no pain  
And I swear I got that shit that make these bitches go insane  
So they tell me that they love me, I know better than that, it's just game  
It's just what comes with the fame, and I'm ready for that, I'm just sayin'  
But I really can't complain, everything is kosher  
Two thumbs up, Ebert and Roeper  
I really can't see the end getting any closer  
But I probly still be the man when everything is over  
So I'm riding through the city with my high beams on  
Can you see me? Can you see me? Get your Visine on  
Y'all just do not fit the picture, turn your widescreen on  
If you thinkin' I'm a quit before I die, dream on  
Man, they treat me like a legend, am I really this cold?  
I'm really too young to be feelin' this old  
It's about time you admit it, who you kiddin', man?  
Man, nobody's never done it like I did it (Ugh)  
  
I know way too many people here right now

"How I'm feeling, it doesn't matter  
'Cause you know I'm okay  
Instead, I ask myself ""why do you hurt me?""  
When you know, you know I'm the same  
I know, I know that you love me baby  
They're trying to take you away from me  
Only over my dead body  
  
I think I killed everybody in the game last year, man fuck it I was on though  
And I thought I found the girl of my dreams at a strip club, mm  
Fuck it I was wrong though  
Shout out all to all my niggas living tax free  
Nowadays its six figures when they tax me  
Oh well, I guess you lose some and win some  
Long as the outcome is income  
You know I want it all and then some  
Shout out to Asian girls, let the lights dim sum  
Shots came, I don't know where they was sent from  
Probably some bad hoes about to take the hemp from  
Yeah, you know me well nigga  
Yeah, I mean you ain't the only real nigga  
They got me on these white women like Seal nigga  
Slave to the pussy but I'm just playing the field nigga, yeah  
Are these people really discussing my career again?  
Asking if I'll be going platinum in a year again  
Don't I got the shit the world wanna hear again?  
Don't Michael Jordan still got his hoop earing in?  
Man all of your flows bore me, paint drying  
And I don't ever be trippin' off of what ain't mine  
And I be hearing the shit you say through the grapevine  
But jealousy is just love and hate at the same time  
It's been that way from the beginning  
I just been playing, I ain't even know that I was winning  
And this is the only sound you should fear  
Man, these kids wear crowns over here and everything is alright

I know, I know that you love me baby  
They're trying to take you away from me  
Only over my dead body  
  
You say I'm old news, well who the new star?  
'Cause if I'm going anywhere, it's probably too far  
Just performed at a Bar Mitzvah over in the States  
Used half of the money to beat my brother's case  
Red wine over Fed time  
But shout out to the niggas that's doing dead time  
And shout out to the bitches there when it's bedtime  
And fuck you to the niggas that think it's their time  
Yeah, don't make me take your life apart boy  
You and whoever the fuck gave you your start boy  
Or you wanna be a muthafuckin' funny guy?  
Don't make me break your Kevin heart boy  
Yeah, it's whatever. You know, feeling good, living better  
I think maybe I was numb to it last year  
But you know I feel it now more than ever  
My city love me like Mac Dre in the Bay  
Second album, I'm back paving the way  
The backpackers are back on the bandwagon  
Like this was my comeback season back, back in the day  
And I met your baby moms last night  
We took a picture together, I hope she frames it!  
And I was drinking at the Palms last night  
And ended up losing everything that I came with  
Feel like I've been here before huh?  
I still got ten years to go huh?  
And this is the only sound you should fear  
These kids wear crowns over here  
And everything is all right

Y'all don't even really check for me  
You ain't even hit me when that nigga had threats for me

Girl, cause you got the Batphone in my workline  
You should call it  
When the last time you did something for the first time?  
You have done it all, swear to God  
Niggas talk more than bitches these days  
Got you thinkin' I'm different these days  
Broken telephone for every single conversation  
By the time it gets to you, shit switches these days

I talk, slicker, than a, pimp from Augusta  
Who just had his linen suit dry cleaned  
Bitches what's up witcha  
I hate callin' the women butches, but the bitches love it  
I took some sence and made a nickle of it  
I'm urgin' all daughters to kiss they mothers  
With those lips that all that lipstick covers  
You're never too groen up to miss and hug her  
And girls countin' on me to be there like missin' rubers  
I'm on some Marvin Gaye shit, a bunch of distant lovers  
This ain't the life that I'm used to  
Re-introduced to people I've been intoduced to  
Did you forget me?  
Or are you took scared to tell me that you met me and fear that I wont  
Remember  
I wish you could still accept me for me  
I miss Memphis, Tennessee, my cousins, my dad  
The simplistic beauty that all them southerners had  
I'm half way across the world with dozens of bags  
Feelin' like all four members of Color Me Badd  
In one nigga, amazin' shit  
I got that Courtney Love for ya, that crazy shit  
Ion drink every bottle I own  
I be agin' shit  
And I got them wedding ring flows that engaging shit  
Which one of y'all got fleets on your key chains  
The seats to these Heat games  
I think that you stare at yourself and you see things  
La familia, I've been inducted and instucted  
To stunt on these niggas we don't really fuck with  
Fuck is up?  
Havin' lunch and debatin' Ferrari prices  
23 and goin' through a mid-life crisis  
But tust me I still deliver like a mid-wife  
And no I'm not syin' I'm the nicest  
I just live life like it  
Uh, It a certain type of man to teach  
To be far from hood  
But to understand the streets  
I never threw away that paper with my grammy speech  
Because I haven't hit the pinnacles I plan to reach  
Yeah, You gotta own it if you want it  
Kisses her on the body  
She tells me live in the moment  
And baby I never forget none of that  
Girl I told you I was comin' back

And I know your taste is  
A little bit (mmm) high maintenance (ooh)  
Everybody else basic  
You live life on an everyday basis  
With poetic justice, poetic justice  
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it?  
I mean I write poems in these songs dedicated to you  
When you're in the mood for empathy, theres blood in my pen  
Better yet where your friends and them?

I really wanna show you off

Clearly a lot for me to take in  
It don't make sense  
Young East African Girl, you too busy with your other man  
I was trying to put you on game, put you on a plane  
Take you and your mama to the motherland  
I could do it, maybe one day  
When you figure out you're gonna need someone  
When you figure out it's all right here in the city  
And you don't run from where we come from  
That sound like poetic justice, poetic justice  
You were so new to this life but God you got adjusted  
I mean I write poems in these songs, dedicated to the fun  
Your natural hair and your soft skin, and your big in that sundress (ooh  
Good God, what you doing that walk for?  
When I see that thing move, I just wish we would fight less  
And we would talk more  
And they say communication save relations, I can tell  
But I can never right my wrongs unless I write them down for real

Every time I write these words they become a taboo  
Making sure my punctuation curve, every letter is true  
Living my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof

Love is not just a verb, it's you looking for a maybe

Love is not just a verb and I can see power steering  
drive when you swerve, I want that interference  
It's coherent, I can hear it, mmhmm  
That's your heartbeat  
It either caught me or it called me, mmhmm

Syn had a baby and treated me different  
Erika sued me and opened a business  
Wonder if they wish it could've been different  
Wonder what they'd do put in my position  
I wonder, when my shit drop, do they listen?  
Wonder if they're second guessin' their decisions  
I hate the number 2, that shit is unforgiven  
Tryna satisfy everybody  
It's like they can't get enough  
Until enough is enough  
And then it's too much  
You tip the scale when I weigh my options  
West Palm girls are spoiled rotten  
Tiffany on you, you know you poppin'  
I'll kill somebody if they give you problems  
Master bedroom's where we get it poppin'  
Just ignore all the skeletons in my closet

Sell my secrets and get top dollar  
Sell my secrets for a Range Rover  
Opportunity and temptation  
They would sell my secrets for a tropical vacation  
Sell my secrets back to me if I was payin'  
Who's gonna save me when I need savin'?  
Since Take Care, I've been caretakin'

Can I, can I save you from you?  
Cause you know there's something missing  
And that champagne you've been sippin's not supposed to make you different all
the time  
It's starting to feel like the wrong thing to do, yeah  
Cause with all that recognition it gets hard for you to listen  
To the things that I must say to make you mine  
But live girl, have some fun girl, we'll be fine  
Trying to convince myself I've found one  
Making a mistake I never learned from  
  
[Hook:]  
I swear I always fall for your type, yeah, for your type  
Tell me why I always fall for your type, for your type  
I just can't explain this shit at all  
I just can't explain this shit at all  
I just can't explain this shit at all  
I just can't explain this shit at all  
I believe in people like you  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Cause who am I to judge you on the past, girl  
I bet there's a reason for it all  
You say that you're nothing like the last girl  
I just pray that you don't let me down right now  
But it's too late, cause I'm already yours  
You just gotta promise me, hearts won't break  
And end up like before  
  
[Hook:]  
  
[Verse 3:]  
Look, dress hanging off your shoulder, barely sober  
Telling me how you moving away and starting over  
Girl, quit playing you just drunk. You just saying shit  
Oh you dance, dance like how, like ballet and shit  
Oh, wait... No, I get it girl, I'm with it  
I've been down this road before and yeah I skidded but forget it  
Damn, I wonder why I never why I learned my lesson  
It's feeling like the second chance and it's the first impression  
And I heard it's nothing new except for someone new  
But how you supposed to find the one when anyone will come with you  
Talking to myself but I never listen  
Cause man it's been a while, and I swear that this ones different  
That's why I'mma take you anywhere you wanna go  
Let you meet my friends so they can lecture me again about  
How reckless I have been  
And I'm slowly running out of all the time that I invest in  
Making all the same mistakes  
And I swear I'm just trying to correct it  
And I fall...

"I can see it in your eyes, you're angry  
Regret got shit on what you're feeling now  
Mad cause he ain't like me  
Oh you mad cause nobody ever did it like me  
All the care I would take, all the love that we made  
Now you're trying to find somebody to replace what I gave to you  
It's a shame you didn't keep it, Alicia, Katia  
I know that you gon' hear this, I'm the man  
Yeah I said it, bitch I'm the man  
Don't you forget it  
The way you walk, that's me  
The way you talk, that's me  
The way you've got your hair up, did you forget that's me?  
And the voice in your speaker right now, that's me  
And the voice in your ear, that's me  
Can't you see that I made it? Yeah I made it  
First I made you who you are, then I made it  
And you're wasted with your ladies  
Yeah I'm the reason why you always getting faded  
  
[Chorus]  
Take a shot for me, ooh  
Take a shot for me, ooh  
Take a shot for me  
A shot for me  
A shot for me  
  
Okay look, I'm honest  
Girl I can't lie, I miss you  
You and the music were the only things that I commit to  
I never cheated, for the record, back when I was with you  
But you believe in everything but me girl, I don't get you  
She says I know you changed, I never see you  
Cause you're always busy doing things  
I really wish she had a different way of viewing things  
I think the city that we're from just kinda ruined things  
It's such a small place, not much to do but talk and listen  
The men are jealous and the women all in competition  
And now your friends telling you stories that you often misinterpret  
And taint all the images of your ""Mr. Perfect""  
I could tell that you been crying all night, drinking all summer  
Praying for your happiness, hope that you recover  
This is one I know you hated when you heard it  
And it's worse because you know that I deserve it  
  
[Chorus]  
  
May your neighbors respect you  
Trouble neglect you, angels protect you  
And heaven accept you

"[Chorus]  
How did I end up right here with you  
After all the things that I been through  
Its been one of those days

Now that I'm here baby

I live for the nights that I can't remember,  
With the people that I won't forget  
Spending all the money I just work my ass off  
For the things that I won't regret  
I've been waiting way too long long long long  
Tellin' everybody that I know we about to be on on on on  
I ain't tryin' look like I lie to these niggas that I came up with  
That's my team, never would I let a woman come between  
What we doing right now  
This our dream, Wu Tang Clan niggas want that cream  
I'm the Osirus of the shit right now  
Go to god for the hits right now  
Whatever you wanna drink girl pick right now  
If you can't hold your liquor you better quit right now  
  
[Chorus]  
  
How 'bout you and all your morals and that outfit that you borrowed  
Make the most out of tonight and worry 'bout it all tomorrow  
Understand girl, we fam' girl  
Can't get me right and not do Wayne  
Cash money young money pop champagne  
Presidential suite girl Barrack Hussain  
Tell me can we kick it like Ali Shaheed and Phife Dawg  
People really hate when a backpack rapper get rich  
And start livin' that life dawg  
Feels like when you gettin' to that paper hip hop hates ya  
They would do it just like I do if they could  
Its in our nature  
Ah, young and rich and out of control  
Out in LA blowing clouds of that killer  
I came up in the underground though  
So I'm a spend another ten thousand for Dilla  
Call me over-rated or created or too jaded  
Because any way you put it bitch I made it, yup!

But I always got a starbucks verse bein brewed  
Too hot please please double cup me  
They never gave me support like chuck t's  
And I never trust a nigga sayin trust me  
Nick cannon and will neva did it this I'll  
So you tell... don't you dare interrupt me  
Thanks to my mother for never givin up  
You deserve the world, now gon live it up  
Thanks to uncle steve my hero who always saved us  
I could never give back everything you gave us  
And to my dad even though we was apart  
I couldn't leave you out, you foreva in my heart  
Yeah, and in the name of evelyn cher  
I'll forever forgive anybody that neva was there  
For me, no other woman could ever compare  
My angel I hope heaven's prepared for wheneva you there  
Uhh, I got a revolutionary flow in every scenario comin through ya stereo  
Got a new chick, booty round like the merry go  
Bitches like where he at, they be like there he go  
And this verse deserve a... ?  
Don't cry for me this ain't motha fuckin mario  
Yeah, and polo isn't at my session  
It's the anticipation keepin everybody guessin like  
Look at what I done  
Look at where I'm is  
It's only just begun  
Cause I was stayin home  
When they was havin fun  
So please don't be surprised when they announce that I won  
And this is how my speech goes  
I deserve this shit, I deserve this shit, I deserve this shit  
That's all I got to say  
At the top is where I stay  
And tell my haters never go away, the winner

That's Why I Envy Omar  
Because So Far, I'm Nowhere Close To Malik and Deja

Trying Ta Excel With The Brake On  
I'll Have You Stuck In The Same Spot  
With The Tires Burnin  
And I'm A Liar Turnin 19, Jaded With No Faith  
In Any Female that's Askin What I Was Earnin  
I Met This Recent Lady  
She Knew A Piece Of Sadey By Spinners  
I Guess In My Southern Eyes That She Decent Maybe  
Well Second Thought If We Have It Then She Can Keep The Baby  
Cuz She Aint Give Me The Butterflies That Aleshia Gave Me  
It's Like I'm Using Some Bread To Sop Up Some Decent Gravy

Now You Like Macgyver

And She don't Know That You There When You Standin Right Beside Her  
I can't Relate To That  
I Had To Take It Back A Couple A Years  
When Some Of The Best Kicked It With Drake In Fact  
  
I Bet That They Knew It Cuz In My Mind I Play Through It  
With Yoshi Lee And A. Lewis And A Couple Things That They True In  
And In The End I Listen But I don't See Me As They Do  
Cuz it's My Opinion, My Life, My Potentials For My Wife

Collectively I Look For A Proper Chick That'll Rep For Me

"Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much  
There's no need for us to rush it through  
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much  
This is more than just a new lust for you  
  
Done saying, I'm done playing  
Last time was on the outro  
Stuck in the house, need to get out more  
I've been stacking up like I'm fundraising  
Most people in my position get complacent  
Come places with star girls, end up on them front pages  
I'm quiet but I just ride with it  
Moment I stop having fun with it, I'll be done with it  
I'm the only one that's putting shots up  
And like a potluck, you need to come with it  
Don't run from it, like H-Town in the summer time, I keep it 100  
Lot of girls in my time there, word to Paul Wall, not one fronted  
I was birthed there in my first year, man I know that place like I come from
it  
Backstage at Warehouse in '09 like ""Is Bun coming?  
Fuck that, is any one coming 'fore I show up there and ain't no one there?""  
These days, I could probably pack it for like twenty nights if I go in there  
Back rub from my main thing, I've been stressed out  
Talking to her like back then they didn't want me, I'm blessed now  
Talking to her like this drop, bet a million copies get pressed out  
She tell me, ""Take a deep breath, you're too worried about being the best out""  
  
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much  
There's no need for us to rush it through  
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much  
This is more than just a new lust for you  
  
Someone go tell Noel to get the Backwoods  
Money got my whole family going backwards  
No dinners, no holidays, no nothing  
There's issues at hand that we're not discussing  
Look, I did not sign up for this  
My uncle used to have all these things on his bucket list  
And now he's acting like, oh, well, this is life, I guess, ""Nah, fuck that
shit  
Listen man, you can still do what you wanna do, you gotta trust that shit""  
Heard once that in dire times when you need a sign, that's when they appear  
Guess since my text message didn't resonate, I'll just say it here  
Hate the fact my mom cooped up in her apartment, telling herself  
That she's too sick to get dressed up and go do shit, like that's true shit  
And all my family from the M-Town that I've been 'round, started treating me
like I'm ""him"" now  
Like we don't know each other, we ain't grow together, we just friends now  
Shit got me feeling pinned down, pick the pen up and put the pen down  
Writing to you from a distance like a pen pal, but we've been down  
  
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much  
There's no need for us to rush it through  
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much  
This is more than just a new lust for you  
  
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much  
There's no need for us to rush it through

I tell 'em they belong to me, that goes on for forever  
And I think we just get closer when we not together  
You tell me that I'm confusin'  
More immature than Marques Houston  
Cuts too deep for a band-aid solution  
We too deep in this thing you'll never lose me  
LOLOL I'm glad you find this shit amusin'  
Heard a lot about me 'fore we started off  
I know you heard that my pool parties like Mardi Gras  
I know you heard that my girl is sponsored by Audemars  
That's why she's always correctin' me when my time is off  
And my house is the definition  
Of alcohol and weed addiction  
You got a different vision  
You wanna walk around naked in the kitchen  
Without runnin' into one of my niggas  
That's not the way we livin'  
Too much goin' on, it's just not realistic  
These days I don't talk 'bout them days like I miss 'em

I wanna know how much time you spent on them paragraphs  
Where you're getting me  
All that grey in our conversation history, you  
Playin' mind games, when you sayin' things  
Playin' mime games, we both doin' the same thing  
Slide on a late night  
You like to slide on a late night  
You send the ""are you here?"" text without an invite  
That's that shit that I don't like  
We both slide on a late night  
Do things in our off time  
We both, yeah  
Made some mistakes, pon road  
Yeah, how's that for real?  
You toyin' with it like Happy Meal  
3 dots, you thinkin' of a reaction still  
While you're typin' make sure you tell me

What type of games are bein' played?  
How's it goin' down?

Remember you was livin' at The London for a month  
Service elevator up to 4201  
We was still a secret, couldn't come in through the front  
Girl I had your back when all you used to do was front  
That's for sure though, I made a career off reminiscin'  
Time got a funny way of tickin', things are so much different  
I'll admit it, I've admitted to a lot of things  
Act like you know it, fuck them stories, fuck the shade they throwin'  
Understand I got responsibilities to people that I need  
And on my way to make this dough  
A lot of niggas cut the cheque so they can take this flow  
A lot of niggas cut the cheque so they can take this flow, Ohhh, ohhh!  
Tryna give your ass the world  
You runnin' your fingers through my curls  
You knew me when the kid had waves  
But that's enough of that  
You could never say I came up and forgot about your ass  
And that's some real shit

Oh, fuck with me, I buy the shots  
Live a little, cause niggas die a lot, and lie a lot  
But I'm the truth that's right I fucking said it  
The living proof that you ain't gotta die to get to heaven  
You girl, you right there, you look like you like this shit  
How'd I know, how'd I know? That's me on some psychic shit

But I might talk that real if you ask me what I care about  
Reppin' bitches, reppin' bitches bitches  
And reppin' reppin' them bitches until all of us switches  
I swear, it's been two years since somebody ask me who I was  
I'm the greatest man I said that before I knew I was  
That's what's important and what really happened before this  
When me and my crew was all about this rapper from New Orleans  
Singing walking like a man, finger on the trigger  
I got money in my pocket, I'm a uptown nigga, ah  
With fame on my mind, my girl on my nerves  
I was pushing myself to get something that I deserve  
That was back in the days, Acura days  
I was a cold dude, I'm getting back to my ways  
  
[Chorus]  
People always ask how I got my nice things  
Take my crown to the grave, I'm an underground king  
I bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told  
Cause I'm down to spend whatever, lately I've been on a roll  
And I do it for the city, cause you know the city love a nigga  
Do it for the city, cause you know the city love it a nigga  
Do it for the city, cause you know the city love it a nigga  
Do it for the city, (UGK fuck these other niggas)  
  
Sometimes I need that romance, sometimes I need that pole dance  
Sometimes I need that stripper that's gon' tell me that she don't dance  
Tell me lies, make it sound good, make it sound good  
Do me like the women from my town would  
Leather with that woodgrain, Persian rugs on wood floors  
Talking all them good things, that's all I'm really good for  
Memphis Tennessee no, see I start to go deep back  
And rich crust with my seat back with Yo Gotti and E-Mack  
And these niggas got them diamonds glowing in they mouth  
And they rockin' furs like it's snowing in the south  
And every pretty girl tell me that's the shit that she like  
So why am I a classic, this is who I'm trying to be like  
So I drop out, lessons I was taught are quick to fade  
As soon I realize that term-end papers they won't get me paid  
If I don't nothing I'ma ball  
I'm countin' all day like a clock on the wall  
Yeah need that, making major changes to the life I'm living

Naw, I got a decent set of manners  
And a job that fills up any empty schedule or planner  
And I fall in love with girls caught up in superficial glamour  
Who dress like Sarah Jessica and  
Live like Princess Diana  
So often they have addictions and  
I'm no one that'll feed it  
But truly you're bad enough  
That you don't even really need it  
You can show up at the party on dirty public transit  
And I guarantee the camera man will still be snappin  
Candids of you and yo posse partying  
Drinking watch you get handed  
With your virgin island tans  
All lookin like you just landed

I'm never backing down  
So overstand me  
I gotta condo in Miami and  
My doormat is always sandy  
And I run Louisiana  
But I've never pull a hammy  
And I gotta condo in Atlanta  
And I always wear a bandana  
And when it comes down to stuntin you boys  
Is just buntin  
I'm swinging from the fence  
Yo girl hanging from my dick  
Yo girl singing to my shit  
Like a la, la, lollipop

She say I get that pussy better  
Better than her gynecologist

I, I'm doin' classic shit in all my sessions,  
Other nigga's situations they are all depressin',  
That's why I never follow y'all suggestions,  
I just always did my own thing,  
Now I run the game, you stupid mudda-suckas

Or there'll be shots on T-M-Z, of me givin' her mouth-to-mouth,  
Now she's famous and the paparazzi starts to shoot her,

I don't ever play but I'm in the game lady,  
They just loose to love, those are tennis games lady,  
Have you countin' money goin' duffle bag crazy,  
Sippin' on Pink Floyd an puffin' Wayne Brady,  
Damn, who's line is it anyways,  
I'm in a daze, you been amazed,  
Y'all seem to be stuck on that beginner stage,  
I'm on fire, yup I've been a blaze,  
I got dough to blow, but I wanna blow it right,  
You look nice, and yo' frame, makes me wanna bowl a strike  
Well alright, guess I might, know what? Fuck it, yes I will,

From the free throw line and slam it down like I'm the great Mike

She said she workin' for Walgreens but not in the store, at the head office  
The head was so good it make sense why you work at the head office  
In 2007 I sat in a lobby in Motown and waited  
Now I go into the buildin' and go off like ""Nigga we made it!""  
When I walk through these halls, man this beat should be playin'  
I just came to make sure you not missin' no payments  
Now turn this shit down while I issue my statement  
It needed a moment of silence, nigga we made it!  
You fly out your lady, I fly out my ladies  
Bitches can't front on the kid anymore, man they know what my name is  
And if by chance she don't know who I am, she just know that I'm famous  
Imma just hand her a business card and say ""Nigga we made it!""  
And she gotta come to the hotel and pop it off for me  
Then she gon' text her best friend like ""Girl he got some good dick and money""  
Her friend hit her back like ""I know that already, that nigga's amazin'""  
Then I send a message to both of they asses like ""Nigga we made it!""

Kinda makes me wonder why the hell so many people are tryna tell me to slow

When Baca came home for the holidays, I was like ""Nigga we made it!""  
And all of those lawyer fees, nigga I paid it  
My family get all of my loyalty, all of my patience  
My life for your life, man I wouldn't trade it  
I would just look at you dead in the face and say ""Nigga we made it""  
I swear that we made it  
But I've been on that wave, that's why this year I tell yah, I don't need no
favors

And my resolution for New Years is nigga we made it  
You don't know how long I waited, I coulda been waitin' on tables, my karma's

I'm out in the Caymans, rented a 12-bedroom house just to sleep all the women

That's ignorant, ain't it? Sometimes I question myself when I think 'bout the

You should take it as a sign, man I got it right now.  
I wouldn't doubt it cause these bitches all about it right now  
Let's be real about this shit, can I take you home?  
Or come to where you stay? Do you live on your own?  
I heard you got your ways, I never would have known  
She said ""you're such a dog"" I said ""you're such a bone.""  
I've been everywhere, where you know me from?  
These days women give it to me like they owe me one  
But they crave attention though they always saying ""Show me something.""

Too late  
I cant keep chasing 'em  
I'm taking my life back  
Caught in a change  
Twenty five to life  
  
I don't think she understands the sacrifices that I've made  
Maybe if this bitch had acted right I would've stayed  
But I've already wasted over half of my life I would've laid  
Down and died for you I no longer cried for you  
No more pain bitch you  
Took me for granted took my heart and ran it straight into the planet  
Into the dirt I can no longer stand it  
Now my respect I demand it  
I'm a take control of this relationship  
Command it, and I'm a be the boss of you now goddammit  
And what I mean is that I will no longer let you control me  
So you better hear me out this much you owe me  
I gave up my life for you, totally devoted to you while I've stayed  
Faithful all the way this is how I fucking get repaid  
Look at how I dress fucking baggy sweats, go to work a mess  
Always in a rush to get back to you I ain't heard you yet  
Not even once say you appreciate me I deserve respect  
I've done my best to give you nothing less than perfectness  
And I know that if I end this I'll no longer have nothing left  
But you keep treating me like a staircase its time to fucking step  
And I wont be coming back so don't hold your fucking breath  
You know what you've done no need to go in depth  
I told you, you'd be sorry if I fucking left  
I'd laugh while you wept  
Hows it feel now, yeah, funny ain't it, you neglected me  
Did me a favor although my spirit free you've said  
But a special place for you in my heart I have kept  
Its unfortunate but its

Cause that ain't good enough you expect me to fold myself in half  
Til I snap  
Don't think I'm loyal  
All I do is rap  
I can not moonlight on the side  
I have no life outside of that  
Don't I give you enough of my time  
You don't think so do you  
Jealous when I spend time with the girls  
Why I'm married to you still man I don't know  
But tonight I'm serving you with papers  
I'm divorcing you  
Go marry someone else and make 'em famous  
And take away there freedom like you did to me  
Treat 'em like you don't need them and they ain't worthy of you  
Feed 'em the same shit you made me eat  
I'm moving on forget you oh,  
Now I'm special? Oh, I didn't feel special when I was with you  
All I ever felt was this  
Helplessness  
Imprisoned by a selfish bitch  
Chew me up and spit me out  
I fell for this so many times  
Its ridiculous  
And still I stick with this  
I'm sick of this but in my sickness and addiction  
Your as addictive as they get  
Evil as they come vindictive as they make 'em  
My friends keep asking why I cant just walk away  
I'm addicted  
To the pain, the stress, the drama  
I'm drown in so I guess I'm a mess  
Cursed and blessed  
But this time I'm a  
Ain't changing my mind  
I'm climbing out this abyss  
You screaming as I walk out that I'll be missed  
But when you spoke to people who meant the most to you

Maybe they'll show some boobs  
Surfing every channel  
Until I find Hannah Montana  
Then I reach for the aloe and lanalin'  
Blood all over the wall panel and dismantlin'  
Every candle on top of the fire place

Grab my flannel and my bandana' then

Dazed and not so confused

December I think it was  
I was having drinks with my cousin  
And I wrapped him  
In Christmas lights  
Pushed him into the stinkin' tub  
Cut him up into pieces  
Then just when I went to drink his  
Blood  
I thought I outta drink his bath water

Since the third time that I failed 9th grade  
You probably think that I'm a negative person don't be so sure of it  
I don't promote violence I just encourage it

As I fall down a cement flight of steps  
And land inside a bed of spider webs

On the gunshot victims full of bullet slugs  
Who were picked up in an ambulance  
And driven  
To receiving with the asses ripped outta they pants  
And given  
A less than 20 percent chance  
Of living  
Have a possible placement  
It's a hospital patient  
Storing the dead bodies in grandma's little basement  
Doctor Kevorkian has arrived

Driving a rusty scalpel in through the top of your scalp  
And pulling your adams apple out through your mouth

To set fire to carpet  
And burn up your entire apartment

Got your bitch wrapped around my dick

Until it dries, for the moment I guess you're all safe.  
After I sand it and buff it, I guess that I'll paint  
My chainsaw's outta gas, my regular saw ain't.  
Now here I come again, damn stomach rumblin',  
You can even hear the evil spirits comin' from within.  
Someone's in the back of my damn house rummagin',  
It's a girl, she looks pretty thin, but I want her skin.  
Been on the hunt again, when will it ever end?  
Evelyn, why you tryin' to fight? You will never win.  
Severin' legs, arms, damn there goes another limb.  
Pull the lever then, trap door, death is evident.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now, what ya know about Buffalo Bill?  
Nothin', so chill.  
Fuckin' hoe, ya better fuckin' hold still.  
Make sure none of that lotion in the bucket don't spill.  
Cut em, gut 'em 'n just get to stuffin' those girls.  
Man,I think she had enough of those pills,  
So take that thing away to come back later, just to clutch in those steel  
Blades, baby when I cut ya don't squeal,  
I hate the loud noises, I fuckin' told you!  
I keep hearin' voices, like ""Wouldn't ya like to go an get your butcher knife,  
And push it right through her, while ya put your shish-kebab skewers  
Into her barbaquer? Would ya do to her  
What ya usually do to a girl who's skin's newer?""  
""In a world of sin-doer, this is turnin' into a  
Torment tournament of sorts, Christmas ornaments you are.""  
I'll be sure to Gin-sue ya til there's no more skin to ya.  
Boo-ya, who ya think your fuckin' with?  
Duck, because here he comes again.

"Marshall, sounds like an S.O.S.  
Holy whack unlyrical lyrics Andre, you're fuckin' right!  
To the rap mobile, let's go!  
  
Marshall! Marshall!  
  
Bitches and Gentleman!  
It's showtime!  
Hurry, hurry, step right up!  
Introducin' the star of our show, his name is  
  
Marshall!  
  
You wouldn't wanna be anywhere else in the world right now  
So without further ado, I bring to you  
  
Marshall!  
  
You 'bout to witness hip hop in its  
Most purest, most rawest form, flow almost flawless  
Most hardest, most honest, known artist  
Chip off the old block but old doc is  
Looks like Batman brought his own Robin  
Oh God, Saddam's got his own Laden  
With his own private plane, his own pilot  
Set to blow college dorm room doors off the hinges (boom sound)  
Oranges, peach, pears, plums, syringes  
Yeah, here I come  
I'm inches away from you, here, fear none  
Hip hop is in a state of 911, so  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
Let's get down to business  
I don't got no time to play around what is this?  
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down  
On these clowns, can I get a witness?  
Hell Yeah!  
  
Quick gotta move fast, gotta perform miracles  
Gee willikers Dre, holy bat syllables  
Look at all the bullshit that goes on in Gotham  
When I'm gone time to get rid of these rap criminals  
So, skip to ya Lou, while I do what I do best  
You ain't even impressed no more, you used to it  
Flows too wet, nobody close to it  
Nobody says it was 'til everyone knows the shit  
The most hated on outta all those who say they get hated  
On eighties songs  
Exaggerate it all so much  
They make it all up  
There's no such thing  
Like a female with good looks who cooks and cleans  
It just means so much more to so much more  
People when you rappin' and you know what for  
The show must go on, so I'd like to welcome y'all  
To Marshall and Andre's carnival  
Come on! Now  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
It's just like old times, the dynamic duo  
Two old friends, why panic?  
You already who's fully capable, the two caped heroes  
Dial straight down the center eight hundred  
You can even call collect, the most feared duet  
Since me and Elton, play career Russian Roulette  
And never even seen me blink get me bustin' a sweat  
People steppin' over people just to rush to the set  
Just to get to see a MC who breathes so freely  
Ease ova these beats, and be so breezy  
Jesus, how can shit be so easy  
How can one Chandra be so Levy  
Turn on these beats MC's don't see me  
Believe me, B-E-T and M-T-V  
Are gonna grieve when we leave, dog fo' sheezy  
Can't leave rap alone the game needs me  
'Til we grow beards, get weird and disappear into the mountains  
Nothin' but clowns down here  
But we ain't fuckin' around 'round here  
Yo Dre!  
What up?  
Can I get a hell yeah?  
Hell Yeah!  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
So there you have it folks  
Marshall!  
Has come to save the day  
Back with his friend Andre  
And to remind you that bullshit does not pay  
Because  
Marshall!  
And Andre are here to stay and never go away  
Until our dying day, until we're old and gray  
Marshall!  
So until next time friends  
Same blond hair, same rap channel  
Goodnight everyone, thank you for coming  
Your host for the evening  
Marshall!  
Oh! Ha!

"So this is it  
This is what I wished for  
Just isn't how I envisioned it  
Fame to the point of imprisonment  
I just thought the shit'd be different  
But something changed  
The minute that I got a whiff of it  
I started to inhale it  
Smell it  
Started sniffin' it  
And it became my cocaine  
I just couldn't quit  
I just wanted a little bit  
Then it turned me to a monster  
I became a hypocrite  
Concert after concert  
  
I was raking in the dough  
Rolling in green  
Had the game hemmed up  
Like a sewing machine  
But I was losing my freedom  
There was no where for me  
To not go and be seen  
And just go and be me  
And there was no in-between  
You either loved it or hate it  
  
Every CD critics gave it a three, then three  
Years later, they'd go back and re-rate it  
And call the Slim Shady LP the greatest  
The Marshall Mathers was a classic  
The Eminem Show was fantastic  
But Encore just didn't have the caliber to match it  
I guess enough time just ain't passed, yet  
A couple more years, that shit'll be ill-matic  
And eight years later, I'm still at it  
Divorce, re-married  
A felon  
A father  
Sleeping pill addict  
And this is real talk  
I feel like the Incredible Hulk  
My back has been broke, and I can still walk  
  
So be careful what you wish for  
'Cause you just might get it  
And if you get it then you just might not know  
What to do wit' it, 'cause it might just  
Come back on you ten-fold  
  
I said  
  
Be careful what you wish for  
'Cause you just might get it  
And if you get it then you just might not know  
What to do wit' it, 'cause it might just  
Come back on you ten-fold  
  
I got a letter from a fan, that said  
He's been praying for me  
Every day and for some reason  
It's been weighing on my mind heavy  
'Cause I don't read every  
Letter I get, but something told me to go ahead and open it, but  
Why would someone pray for you when they don't know you?  
You didn't pray for me when I was local  
And as I lay these vocals  
I think of all the shit I had to go through  
Just to get to where I'm at  
I've already told you at least  
  
A thousand times in these rhymes  
I appreciate the prayer, but I've already got  
God on my side  
And it's been one hell of a ride, hasn't it?  
Just watchin' it from an opposite standpoint  
Man, boy's got to look  
Nuts  
And that's the only word I can think of right now  
On how  
To describe the shit  
This is like a vibe you get  
Go ahead and bob to it  
Just watch what you wish for, 'cause I got the shit  
  
So be careful what you wish for  
'Cause you just might get it  
And if you get it then you just might not know  
What to do wit' it, 'cause it might just  
Come back on you ten-fold  
  
I said  
  
Be careful what you wish for  
'Cause you just might get it  
And if you get it then you just might not know  
What to do wit' it, 'cause it might just  
Come back on you ten-fold

"You are now listening to the sounds of...Shady
and...Alchemist..Alchemist..Alchemist...  
Got an axe in the duffel bag, couple of fags,  
Stuffed in the backseat, muzzled n gagged,  
Wrapped in bubble wrap, two lesbians ahh,  
Couple hustler mags, now grab the pez dispenser,  
Fill it up to the max, with muscle relaxers,  
The governor of Alaska, She lusts when I ask her,  
To shove my polaski sausage up in her ass huh,  
While we hover over Nebraska,  
Shooting at the fucking buffalo pasture,  
In the helicopter, man I can't fuck her no faster,  
She's screaming grab my titties, shady suck on those bastards,  
But I ain't no sucker, I won't snuggle up with her after,  
I'm a gigolo, But Ya'll look like the juggalo rapper,  
Everyday man I just seem to get a little bit doper,  
Shit, Back down,  
Man I'd rather lick on a scrotum,  
And eat the fucking octa Mom's pussy lips with some okra,  
While I watch Whoopi Goldberg, Sizzle with Oprah,  
While bossy pussy farts and takes a piss on the sofa,  
Getting home and play dick swords with the Jonas...Brothers,  
Your mother fucking mothers are roamers, Like no other,  
I keep thinking of her smothered in soma's...  
Its chemical warfare, Drop bombs like sadam,  
I'm bringing the drama, Like Barrack Obama,  
Playing rock em' sock em' robots with the Octo Mama,  
I'm vato loco, homie I'll cock those llamas,

"Where's my snare?  
I have no snare in my headphones  
There you go, yeah, yo yo  
Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?  
I have, I've been protested and demonstrated against  
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times  
Sick as the mind of the motherfuckin' kid that's behind  
All this commotion emotions run deep as oceans explodin'  
Tempers flaring from parents just blow 'em off and keep goin'  
Not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'  
Keep kickin' ass in the mornin' and takin' names in the evening  
Leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in their mouth  
See they can trigger me but they never figure me out  
Look at me now, I bet ya probably sick of me now  
Ain't you mama I'm a make you look so ridiculous now  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
I said I'm sorry mama  
I never meant to hurt you  
I never meant to make you cry  
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet  
  
I got some skeletons in my closet and  
I don't know if no one knows it  
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it  
I'm a expose it, I'll take you back to '73  
Before I ever had a multi-platinum sellin' C-D  
I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months  
My fagot father must have had his panties up in a bunch  
Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye  
No, I don't, on second thought, I just fuckin' wished he would die  
I look at Hailie and I couldn't picture leavin' her side  
Even if I hated Kim, I grit my teeth and I  
Try to make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake  
I maybe made some mistakes but I'm only human  
But I'm man enough to face them today!  
What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb  
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets out of that gun  
Cause I'd a killed them, shit I woulda shot Kim and him both  
This my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to The Eminem Show  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Now I would never dis my own mama  
Just to get recognition  
Take a second to listen who you think this record is dissin'  
But put yourself in my position just try to envision  
Witnessin' yo mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen  
Bitchin' that someones always goin' through her purse and shit's missin'  
Goin' through public housing systems, victim of Munchhausen's syndrome  
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't  
'Til I grew up, now I blew up  
It makes you sick to your stomach doesn't it?  
Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, Ma?  
So you could try to justify the way you treated me, Ma?  
Well guess what your gettin' older now and  
It's cold when your lonely and Nathan's growin' up so quick  
He's gonna know that your phony  
And Hailie's gettin' so big now, you should see her she's beautiful  
But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral!  
See what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong  
Bitch, do your song  
Keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom  
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get  
You selfish bitch, I hope you fuckin' burn in hell for this shit  
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?  
Well guess what I am dead, dead to you as can be!

Got to have it,  
Yeah I made it  
I'm addicted  
  
[Eminem - Verse 1]  
This was a beat with no words at first, it's a blank painting  
Exercising the mind, it's brain strength training  
Starts off something like shady's an insane maniac  
Yeah slim shady that's a zany name aint it  
Now all you needs an image to go with the name, baby  
Wife beaters and white t-shirts  
Hanes mainly, it's a long shot but is it possible  
There's a lane maybe,  
If not, he's gonna have to come and change the whole game aint he  
He wants the fame so bad he can taste it  
He can see his name up in lights  
Women screaming his f-cking name feinting  
Shady did it, he sold out the whole dang stadium  
Joe Shmoe made it, he took his plain Jane lady  
And his baby Hailey out the trailer  
But he aint trailing anymore he's ahead of the race  
While maintaining his innocence  
Little does he know his train is derailing  
And he's about to be raped by this game anally.

Got to have it,  
Yeah I made it

Syllables spit like dillingers  
Spilling your guts  
People are feeling your mic skills  
But these haters are ice grillin' ya  
Willing to sacrifice anything for the life thye might steal from ya  
Fake friends will kill for ya, die for ya  
But you can't decipher why for the life of ya  
It wasn't like this when you were cyphering  
Argue with your ife again  
She found vicodin in your pants last night again  
Your disputes public  
Nothings private anymore  
When your best friends say bye bye to him  
What kind of apple you take a bite of slim  
(But this is what you wanted Marshall aint it)  
F-ck no, the way that it turned out  
Was nothing like the picture that I painted in my head  
Sometimes a dream I make is more fun than to actually make it  
The game stripped me naked  
It robbed me of ever having another real relation-ship  
With another girl, this World is a f-cking trip  
As I slip in another world  
Proceed, take another hit  
Sniff til I f-cking url  
Tell em all to f-cking sit and spin til they f-cking twirl  
Middle finger up again  
Relapsing back in this game, oh well, f-ck it then

"Ladies and gentlemen  
The moment you've all been waiting for,  
In this corner, weighing a hundred and seventy five pounds,  
With a record of seventeen rapes, four hundred assaults, and four murders,  
The undisputed, most diabolic villain in the world  
Slim Shady!  
  
[Chorus]  
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle  
Don't act like a snobby model you just hit the lotto  
O-oh o-oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe  
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got clothes  
Now where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?  
I noticed there's so many of them  
And there's really not that many of us.  
Ladies love us, my posse's kicking up dust.  
It's on till the break of dawn  
And we're starting this party from dusk  
  
OK, let's go  
  
Back with Andre, the giant, mister elephant tusk  
Picture us, you'll just be another one bit the dust  
Just one of my mothers sons who got thrown under the bus  
Kiss my butt. Lick the wonder cheese from under my nuts  
It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks  
It's a must I redeem my name and haters get mushed.  
Bitches lust. Man they love me when I lay in the cut.  
Fist the cup. The lady gave her eighty some paper cut.  
Now picture us. It's ridiculous you curse at the thought  
'Cause when I spit the verse the shit  
Gets worse then Worcestershire sauce  
If I could fit the words as picture perfect, works every time  
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes  
It's elementary. The elephants have entered the room.  
I venture to say we're the center of attention it's true  
Not to mention back with a vengeance so here's the signal  
Of the bat symbol. The platinum trio's back on you hoes.

They see that low rider go by they're, like Oh my!  
You ain't got to tell me why you're sick cuz I know why.  
I dip through in that six trey like sick 'em Dre.  
I'm an itch that they can't scratch, they sick of me.  
But hey, what else can I say? I love LA.  
Cause over and above all, it's just another day  
And this one begins where the last one ends.  
Pick up where we left off and get smashed again.  
I'll be dammed, just fucked around and crashed my Benz.  
Driving around with a smashed front end  
Let's cash that one in.  
Grab another one from out the stable  
The Monte Carlo, El Camino or the El Dorado  
The hell if I know.  
Do I want leather seats or vinyl?  
Decisions, decisions  
Garage looks like Precision Collision.  
Or Maaco beats quake like Waco  
Just keep the bass low speakers away from your face though

And I take great pleasure in introducing, 50 Cent!  
  
It's bottle after bottle  
The money ain't a thing when you party with me

We ball out of control like you wouldn't believe  
I'm the napalm the bomb the don I'm King Kong  
Get rolled on wrapped up and reigned on  
I'm so calm through Vietnam ring the alarm  
Bring the Shaun Dawn burn marijuana do what you want  
Nigga on and on till the break of what  
Get the paper man I'm caking you know I don't give a fuck  
I spend it like it don't mean nothing  
Blow it like its supposed to be blown

French role stylin', body like a Stallion

The womb beata', clean pussy eata, insertin' my jock  
In that spot hotta' than the hottest block, don't stop!

Clocks steadin' tickin', kinky finga lickin'  
Then carryin on, semin's at my tip when she moans  
I gotta slow down before I cum soon  
And work that nigga, like a slave owna'  
When I dropped off my outfit, she knew I wanted to bone her  
She foamin' at them lips, the ones between the hips  
Pubic hair's lookin' like some sour cream dip  
Without the nacho, my dick hit the spot though  
Pussy tighta' than conditions of us black folks  
we in the final stretch, the last part of sex  
I bust a fat ass nut, then I woke up next  
Like, what the fuck is goin' on here?  
This bitch evaporated, pussy and all just picked up and vacated  
And now I'm frustrated cause my dick was unprotected  
And doctor Wesley tellin' me I really got that shit  
Fuck

Now I don't wanna hit no women when this chick's got it comin'  
Someone betta' get this bitch 'fore she gets kicked in the stomach  
And she's pregnant, but she's eggin' me on, beggin' me to throw 'er  
Off the steps on this porch, my only weapon is force  
And I don't wanna resort to violence of any sort  
But what's she shovin' me for? Doesn't she love me no more?  
Wasn't she huggin' me four minutes ago at the door?  
Man I'm this close to goin' toe to toe with this whore  
What would you do if she was tellin' you she wants a divorce  
She's havin' another baby of the month and it's yours  
And you found it isn't 'cause this bitch has been visitin'  
Someone else and suckin' his dick and kissin' you on the lips  
When you get back to Michigan  
Now the plot has thickend 'n worse  
'Cause you feel like you've been stickin' your fuckin' dick in a hearse  
So your paranoid at every little cold that you get  
Ever since they sold you this shit, you've been holdin' your dick  
So you go to the clinic, sweatin' every minute you in it  
Then the doctor comes out lookin' like Dennis the Menace ha ha ha ha  
And it's obvious to everyone in the lobby, it's AIDS  
He ain't even gotta call in you his office to say it  
So you jet back home, 'cause you gon' get that ho  
And when you see 'er, you're gonna bend 'er fuckin' neck back yo  
'Cause you love 'er, you neva' would've expect that blow  
Obie told you to scoop, how could she stoop that low?  
Jesus, I don't believe this bitch works at the cleanas  
Bringin' me home diseases swingin' from Obie's penis

Back in the day when I met Dre  
I used to sit and goof on the phone with, my friend Proof  
That if I went gold, I'd go right through the roof  
He said what If you went platinum, I'd just laugh at him  
That's not happening, that I can't fathom  
Eighty something million records worldwide later,  
I'm living in a house with a fucking elevator  
  
Haters getting mad, they done had enough of Shady  
You slay me, nothing you say matters enough that you shame me  
Rappers try to play me, they use Hailie as a ukulele  
Woopsa that a fucking daisy  
That's a no-no who even she knows Dada's fucking crazy  
Fucking animal, cookoo, bananas, fucking A B  
Maybe it's because I never had a mother raise me  
Fuck around and throw a baby at another baby  
You may think it's cause of the way that I was brought up  
But it's all caught up to me now, karma's in the waters  
Every line I ever said has got me in a corner  
You might think it doesn't creep upon ya, but it all does  
You wouldn't listen man, I tried to warn ya when you started  
Now your brains all horny cause of all the shit you thought of  
Chainsaw slaughters turn your daughters into sawdust  
I never thought it'd come to this, I outta just be honest but

Sorry Lance, Mr. Lambert and Aiken ain't gonna make it fake it

Someone shut that fucking baby up, 'for I shake it  
You're standing adjacent to Jason's last slut, they're facing  
Together makes 'em, a fucking bad combination  
I lashed at the doctor in my last operation  
Shoved the wiener schnitzel up his ass, hopped away some-  
Body please stop the patient, get the cops to mase him  
Homie, I'm the shizer, pass Doctor Dre some  
I can't leave the game, I just can't walk away son  
No not-a now, not a chance, not today son  
I can't believe I leave for one brief second  
And you pussy's queef all over the rap game, naked  
And use a leaf to clean up the crap stains, feck it  
I just keep saying the same exact saying, check it  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Elevator in my house, I'll smell ya later  
I blew the fuck up, a hamster in a microwave  
Think about an escalator now, steps, I hate 'em  
Told the neighbor step away, then I just pepper sprayed 'em  
Yeah, for every time you ride down the street  
Or hideout, drive by my house and beep  
Like now motherfucker, try now to sleep  
Lie down motherfucker, try countin' sheep  
And you're tryna find out, why now there's beef?  
Mase in your face bitch, cry now pussy  
This is my house, all nine thousand feet  
So you can suck my dick with Amy Winehouse's teeth  
Then I shove 'em in the elevator, take 'em to the top  
Stand above 'em,just to cut the fucking cable, let 'em drop  
Walk an hour to the damn refrigerator, get a pop  
While I let 'em fall all the way to the basement, yelling stop!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Fucking son of a bitch, I can't believe this shit  
This must be all that there is, this must be it  
Fuckin'-A even got a bidet  
Wash my ass after I shit with gold toilet paper  
Dishwasher's so big, when I'm pissed off  
I can just toss a flying saucer in it  
This shit's awesome, yeah, fucking elevator  
Living in a house with a fucking elevator

Get familiar wit it  
  
[Verse 1: Obie Trice]  
Obie the person that came up and deverted  
Cause of nervousness  
That was solely the homie's verdict  
It was worth it  
Cause he changed, became so I observed it  
Certain such of a purpose  
Its like a different version  
So much hurtin' and pain  
Gave him game for certain  
That's why its curtains at his murder if you get him worked up  
I'm so assertive on these motherfuckers actin' tougher  
Had enough of  
Isolating myself in a room  
Writing poems for songs doin' the same in school  
Now look what he became a fool  
Cause he learned how to sustain his two  
And obtain fame from you  
Living hard but still Julliard  
A god walks and ain't spent a day in a pew  
Regardless of this I draw visual pictures when a nigga vents  
So welcome to the art department  
  
[Verse 2: Eminem]  
I stimulate the brain mimick  
Emulate the sane  
Sick of people thinkin' its a fuckin' mimick when it ain't  
Clinically insane  
Brain is on Venus  
Suck your anus (Uranus)  
Label me a genius if you ever seen as you would say  
He may seem as though hes plain normal  
If you ever meet him greet him with a shake see he ain't as mean as what they
say  
See the thing is maybe he can't always think of things to say so hes vague  
So they mistake him for just bein' crazed  
You don't think hes strange  
You turn around and tell him please and thanks  
And catch him flippin' you off with his pants down  
Hands around  
His Scrotum tuckin' his fuckin' penis between his legs

"I don't wanna say goodbye  
But sometimes things just don't go as we'd like  
All I wanna do is cry  
Say my farewells, pack up and leave tonight  
  
Farewell miss I know that you can care less  
But I'm sorry for everything I was careless  
But I need you to know that I love you so much  
And I've been drinking myself to sleep my soul's crushed  
A couple more shots I know I'm gonna go nuts  
I can't deal with the fact you left me with no crutch  
I was in love with you how could you do this to me  
Actually I did this to myself, what a tragedy!  
And now what do I do?  
Where do I go?  
Cause everywhere I go I see your face  
It's hard starting over  
Trying to find another shoulder  
To lean on  
I feel like my whole life just got peed on  
They say time heals but dammit I wanna stop time and feel this pain  
As crazy as it sounds to me it's sane  
And I like it, why? 'cause I feel like we're still united  
In some weird way I don't wanna fight it  
  
I don't wanna say goodbye  
But sometimes things just don't go as we'd like  
All I wanna do is cry  
Say my farewells, pack up and leave tonight  
  
I wrote you the other day and you didn't write back!  
It's like that!? after all the crap we been through!?  
I can't believe you! I know I fucked up!  
But look within you and find some love and stop being stuck up!  
You keep sending me to voicemail!  
I'm annoyed, hell!, shit you coulda at least sent a text  
But you're probably busy kissing someone else's lips  
While I'm sitting here cleaning my shoes from this shit!  
You're hard headed a sharp headache  
I need help call a medic  
I just cut myself, yeah, I did it  
Without you I'm nothing don't you get it!?  
Every time that I said I loved you I meant it!  
You turn and tell me you hate me and regret that  
We ever met, I can't believe you just said that  
You're so cold you just hit me so low  
I can't take this no more, so hit the road  
  
I don't wanna say goodbye  
But sometimes things just don't go as we'd like  
All I wanna do is cry  
Say my farewells, pack up and leave tonight  
  
Some things just don't seem the way they do  
One day you tell me I love you and only you  
I wake up to find out it was a dream  
You're telling me you hate me, you're leaving me  
People change everything changes  
We go from best friends then become strangers  
We go from seeing each other everyday then  
Farewell to never seeing your face again  
  
I can't get you outta of my head  
So I'm out of bed at 4 in the morning  
Wishing I was dead  
But for some odd reason I can't do it  
For some reason I needed to write  
What's on my mind and what's going through it  
Cause if I don't I'll probably suffocate  
Why do you have so much hate  
Towards me you need some loving babe  
God I fucking love you I hate myself  
For falling in love with you  
Just to find out all I did was trouble you  
My heart is aching I'm medicated  
I tried meditating  
But nothing works I don't even feel sedated  
I wish you could feel what I feel for one second  
I reckon you would jump out your window bare naked  
Fuck humiliation, you do anything to get me back  
Opinions wouldn't matter what they thought in fact  
You would tell everyone to fuck themselves good  
And do everything to have me if you could  
  
I don't wanna say goodbye  
But sometimes things just don't go as we'd like  
All I wanna do is cry  
Say my farewells, pack up and leave tonight

And when I'm tired of hearin your shit ill let you know.  
  
Its my turn and I'm gonna drop a bomb  
Blow you up like a fucking Vietcong.

Don't mind my face its a little red.  
Cuz I'm embarrassed to be up here its true  
Its not cuz I'm scared its cuz I'm battling someone like you.  
I mean jesus your rhymes aint even witty  
And every one here knows your lyrics are shitty  
But its ok cuz your tryin your best  
And if you have a girlfriend I'm sure her backs like her chest  
In other words you be fucking a guy  
And don't tell me the excuse, its cuz I was high  
Its cuz your like at the other fags who think their cool  
But infact your really enjoy pushing it stool!  
  
I'm done ok I can't think of any thing else to say  
I'm at lost for words cuz my rhymes might be soundin gay  
But then again we listened to your rhymes so I guess it would be ok.  
Ill finish your off with a one liner and then I'm done.  
This is the rhyme that with solididfy that I won.  
I listened to every rhyme youve said  
And it was all mumble jumble like your were giving some head.  
Now remember I'm white so I don't belong in the rap game

They keep on sayin' the same rappers are the best  
Jay-Z and Kanye West, maybe they're just tryna distract it  
From the fact that I'm comin' back  
Or maybe it's cause I ain't black, maybe it's because of that  
Maybe it's because I'm the highest sellin' artist in rap

I'm still sick, how can I be sick this long  
And I'm still alive, Magic Johnson arise  
I thrive on makin' my opponents think that I've died

When you gonna learn how much money we've earned  
How does it feel to know I came in this game at 25  
And coulda retired at 29 in my 20's still  
And Fif' here to lick on that Coca-Cola shit  
And he ain't even gotta look at coke to even hold a brick  
No more, oh boy, goddamn did he score  
To go from sellin' bags to bottles right out the store  
And Shady hit the box office man, he knocked the socks off us  
My ex-wife is set for life, you profitless cocksuckers  
So stay the fuck off us, we make pay  
I'm just a super easy modest mc, okay?

"Life  
By Marshal Mathers  
What is life?  
Life is like a big obstacle  
In front of your optical to slow you down  
  
And every time you think you gotten past it  
It's gonna come back around and tackle you to the damn ground  
What are friends?  
Friends are people that you think are your friends  
But they really your enemies, with secret identities  
And disguises, to hide they true colors  
So just when you think you close enough to be brothers  
They want to come back and cut your throat when you ain't lookin'  
  
What is money?  
Money is what makes a man act funny  
Money is the root of all evil  
Money'll make them same friends come back around  
Swearing that they was always down  
  
What is life?  
I'm tired of life  
I'm tired of backstabbing ass snakes with friendly grins  
I'm tired of committing so many sins  
Tired of always giving in when this bottle of Henny wins  
Tired of never having any ends  
Tired of having skinny friends hooked on crack and many things  
I'm tired of this DJ playing your shit when he spins  
Tired of not having a deal  
Tired of having to deal with the bullshit without grabbing the steel  
Tired of drowning in my sorrow  
Tired of having to borrow a dollar for gas to start my Monte Carlo  
I'm tired of motherfuckers spraying shit and dartin' off  
I'm tired of jobs startin' off at five fifty an hour  
Then this boss wonders why I'm smartin' off  
Tired of being fired every time I fart and cough  
Tired of having to work as a gas station clerk  
For this jerk breathing down my neck driving me berserk  
I'm tired of using plastic silverware  
Tired of working in Building Square  
Tired of not being a millionaire  
But if I had a million dollars  
I'd buy a damn brewery, and turn the planet into alcoholics  
  
If I had a magic wand,  
I'd make the world suck my dick  
Without a condom on,  
While I'm on the john  
If I had a million bucks  
It wouldn't be enough,  
Because I'd still be out  
Robbing armored trucks  
If I had one wish  
I would ask for a big enough ass  
For the whole world to kiss  
  
I'm tired of being white trash, broke and always poor  
Tired of taking pop bottles back to the party store  
I'm tired of not having a phone  
Tired of not having a home  
To have one in if I did have it on  
Tired of not driving a B-M  
Tired of not working at G-M, tired of wanting to be him  
Tired of not sleeping without a Tylenol P-M  
Tired of not performing in a packed coliseum  
Tired of not being on tour  
Tired of fucking the same blond whore  
After work in the back of a Contour  
I'm tired of faking knots with a stack of ones  
Having a lack of funds and resorting back to guns  
  
Tired of being stared at  
I'm tired of wearing the same damn Nike Air hat  
Tired of stepping in clubs wearing the same pair of Lugz  
Tired of people saying they're tired of hearing me rap about drugs  
Tired of other rappers who ain't bringin' half the skill as me  
Saying they wasn't feeling me when nobody's as ill as me  
I'm tired of radio stations telling fibs  
Tired of J-L-be saying ""Where Hip-Hop Lives""  
  
But if I had a million dollars  
I'd buy a damn brewery, and turn the planet into alcoholics  
If I had a magic wand, I'd make the world suck my dick

How'm I 'sposed to be positive when I don't see shit positive?  
Know what I'm sayin'?  
I rap about shit around me, shit I see  
Know what I'm sayin'?

Tired of all this player hating that's going on in my own city

Twist them up, and indulge in the marijuana smog

Fuck around and catch all of the venereal diseases

My residence was hesitant to do some shit that represents the M-O  
So I'm assuming all responsibility  
'Cause there's a monster will in me that always wants to kill MC's  
Mic messaler, slamming like a wrestler  
Here to make a mess of a lyric smuggling embezzler  
No one is specialer, My skill is intergalactical  
I get cynical act a fool then I send a crew back to school  
I never packed a tool or acted cool, it wasn't practical  
I'd rather let a tactical, tact full track tickle your fancy  
In fact I can't see, or can't imagine  
A man who ain't a lover of beats or a fan of scratching  
So this is for my family, the kid who had a cameo on my last jam  
Plus the man who never had a plan B  
Be all you can be, 'cause once you make an instant hit  
I'm tensed a bit and tempted when I see the sins my friends commit  
I'm infinite

But little boys

I go a little bit crazy sometimes  
I get a little bit out of control with my rhymes  
Good God, dip, do a little slide  
Bend down, touch your toes and just glide, up the center of the dance floor  
Like T-P for my bung hole and it's cool if you let one go

All I know is when I get there, someones gonna touch my body  
Excuse me miss, I don't mean to sound like a jerk

They said save it boy, we got you on tape  
Telling an old lady to ""touch my body""

It gets real tense, no one makes a sound

Proceed with caution, watch your back fella's  
He could be coming at your girlfriend next  
  
Verse 1]  
There's a joker on the loose from the psychiatric ward  
His face is up on the bulletin board with a reward  
He'll stab you with a sword don't be fooled by his charm  
He's probably armed with intent to do bodily harm  
Ring the alarm, look for a man with green hair

He's has a mean stare but usually crack's jokes

We got the walkie-talkies to keep us all informed  
Suited up head to toe in detective uniforms  
Our unit storms in, we split the ghetto in sectors  
Locking down every block and put up metal detectors  
Protectors and be sure that you stand close  
Watch each others backs and guard your command post  
And most of all be advised that he's wise  
He could be disguised as one of your very own guys

[Verse 3]  
I'm on a solo mission to find him personally  
To settle the score and beat then him mercifully  
For what he first did to me  
It's sure to be the last  
Following footprints with a magnifying glass  
To drag his lying ass back to his padded cell  
I'm mad as hell, on the trail of the tattle tail  
I heard a yell the voice sounded familiar  
""Give me your girlfriend or I'm gonna kill ya""

I followed the voice that led down a flight of steps  
Sneezing at dust, and swinging at the spider-webs  
Inside the depths of his basement  
I taste lint in my mouth, then the lights in the place? went!  
I saw my life flash in front of my eyes  
I felt a butcher knife slash at one of my thighs  
None of my guys knew where I'm at I was doomed  
Then I remembered the flashlight in my costume

Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a best friend then

[Verse 5]  
Dealing with backstabber's there was one thing I learned  
They're only powerful when you got your back turned  
I yearned for the day that we finally met again  
So I can give him a taste of his own medicine  
He shed his skin, then he promised to come clean  
I took his butcher knife and jabbed it into his spleen  
Cut him at the seam then dragged the fella home  
Beating him over the head with the telephone

Attention all cars, attention all cars  
Unit 313 has apprehended the suspect  
He's going back to the crazy home, I repeat  
He's going back to the crazy home, how about that?

Cause biters are fallin head over heels  
In love with every rhyme that I've said over reels  
That's how I became paranoid  
Chewin my fingernails, pullin my hair annoyed  
Cause every time you bit it was deliberate  
So I'm forced to hit a little quicker with  
An ultimatum I assault and slayed em  
With rhymes and it's ultimatum just to cultivate em  
Energetic and imaginative,  
Pronouns and verbs, predicates and adjectives  
Will reach out and grab ya, 9 times outta 10  
That's why I'm spilling one of a kind rhymes out a pen

"Yo, check it out, it's fucked up, and I don't see either one of us budging  
  
I'm withholding my anger  
Though I'd like to be the strangler  
Of this punk ass little pussy's puny neck  
It's my right to insist  
That he acknowledge my existence  
But he just displays complete lack of respect  
That's what he says to himself  
As he uses magazines to trash me  
As he sits with both feet up at his desk  
Smokes a bag of his weed  
And starts imagining things  
And he just can't see that he's manically depressed  
And in his jealousy and envy  
It just whirls him in a frenzy  
As he turns on MTV and sees my face  
He don't exist in this world  
So he just twists and he twirls  
Spirals and spins till he runs himself in a rage  
And it's destroying him slowly  
'Cause he does not even know me  
Even though he sees me everywhere he goes  
So he just tortures himself  
He has no fortune and wealth  
So he extorts someone else to get his dough  
And now he's acting like a bully  
So he tries to push and pull me  
But he knows that he can't pull me so he's mad  
He has no choice but to scream  
And raise his voice up at me  
'Cause it annoys him to see that I ain't scared  
  
You ain't no motherfucking (bully)  
And I ain't bowing to no motherfucking (bully)  
I won't allow it, ain't no coward to no (bully)  
I'll be damned if I don't stand up to a (bully)  
Fight like a man and throw my hands up to a (bully...)  
  
And I know it must be fucking with you emotionall(y...)  
  
Now I'm not trying to make no more enemies  
No more unfortunately  
There's so many motherfuckers that just are  
They just keep pounding at me  
Now that I'm down with 50  
Suddenly now I got beef with this faggot Ja' [laughter]  
But his ass is such a puppet  
Irv could shove his whole hand up it  
And just make him say what he wants him to say  
But Suge has Irv's on a string  
And Irv's so nervous that he  
Says anything to this man to keep him at bay  
So now Ja thinks that he's so tough  
And Murder Inc.'s the big bad wolf  
And they go huff and puff and blow our label down  
But our building's made out of bricks  
So you ain't taking out shit  
I know you just did a song with Bobby Brown  
So now you try to pull a race card  
And it backfires in your face hard  
'cause you know we don't play that black and white shit  
Plus this guy that you fucked  
When you was ecstasied up  
Was just a man who's dressed up as a white bitch  
  
You must be taking to much (E...)  
  
Now what bothers me the most  
About hip-hop is we so close  
To picking up where we left off with Big and Pac  
We just lost Jam Master J  
Big L got blasted away  
Plus we lost Bugs, Slayed Son, and Freaky Ta  
It's like a never-ending cycle  
That just seems to come full circle  
Everyone's gotta be so fucking hard  
I'm not excluding myself  
'cause I been stupid as well  
I been known to lose it when someone says something smart  
But as we grow as men  
We learn to let shit go, but then again  
There's only so much bullshit we can really stand  
We all got reps to uphold  
When someone steps on our toes  
It's no exception, it goes for every man  
But if Irv really gave a fuck  
About Ja like he claims he does  
He'd wake him up and make his boy get off them drugs  
But he just keeps feeding him pills  
So if that E doesn't kill him  
Someone from G-Unit will and I ain't buzzed  
Dawg, I'm talking to you straight  
If the situation escalates  
Any worse, we're gonna lose another soldier to this game  
And if I get killed for this rap  
I got a million in cash  
That says I will get you back in Halie's name  
  
Irvine, get your boy off that (E...)  
  
Get at me, dawg

"[Scratched sample] - ""I'm the man!""  
  
I stand in, by the way as I begin  
Do you know who I am? and may reply with a grin  
Yes, I'm tired of being  
Why should I be secluded, I got a brand new horn to be tooted  
To sum it up in a nutshell, ""Eminem will you kick it for me?""  
So I find myself in a certain?depligatory?  
A place where I dwell in, for some wonderful productions  
To make up for lost time,  
Finally let loose, unloading the stockpile  
A mental projectile, I aim like a reptile  
I look to the one handed juggler and ask him this  
""Why is it you insist upon stepping to an octopus?""  
Is there a reason for this? the hatred is aggravating  
How many times will it take you before you realize you're fading?  
Fading from existence, cause simulations are dead  
There's so much more to learn, it pages left to be read,  
So put up the front while you jam for the grammar that's poor  
While I hold the scrapbook that's heavier than the hammer of the mighty Thor  
Words can weigh a ton  
Therefore it's never to fall into the hands of the wrong one  
  
[Scratched samples] - ""Yeah"", ""It's another...  
  
There are few have made an attempt to put a foot on the other side  
But I see no borderline, from under this colorblind  
And some will probably never hold peices of the sacred  
But then I'm finally about to put an end to the hatred  
The world would never endure to arguing  
Awaking to the abscence of unity is startling  
""Oh foolish pride, what the hell is you tryin to do?  
You cannot beat someone that's better than you so quit trying to""  
The outcome we want nothing despicable  
So how do you think you can manage to kick the unkickable  
You're graceless, bland, you're tasteless and you're faceless and  
You're dull it's time you faced this, here taste this  
Straight from off of the pile, one of the numerous styles  
The date of my birth on the Earth, the deliverence of a starchild  
Rest with formidable talent and versatility  
  
But with such a power, there comes a responsibilty  
To infridge on the boundaries, so now the defiance is clear  
To form an alliance is something even the giants fear  
So instead of being oblivious to the color of skin  
Refuser abusin it's accepted now it's a trend  
  
[Scratched samples] - ""Yeah"", ""It's another...""  
  
You know I don't understand why we all just can't get along  
You hate me but you know me and what I stand for  
No? so then why do you speak for me  
And every other white man when you that we're your enemy?  
  
On the floor lies a broken door, cause I'm not to be spoken for  
Stereotypes and superstitions and fictional folklore  
Rarely do you see the lighter side of me  
I try to be persuasive but also invasive and try to end the rivalry  
But I've? apologies are exhausted  
Feelings are turning glacial never to be defrosted  
So who can I trust after repeatedly being shafted  
Switch to the opposite, now see it being re-enacted  
Pull up the? quick,  
These we hate him, these are past us, huh  
Always fighting for the position of top dog  
That spot's already occupied, and I don't play leapfrog  
Cause I do not wish to fight over territory that's already mine  
But I'm always having to proove myself, time after time  
Oh how I never understand how a man could be outcast  
Judged from the past and he's put last  
And bluffing with nothing to say, stutterin and slurrin  
And mutterin words with no meaning, attack me side I'm like Danny Kane  
Here I go again hammerin stammerin grammerin  
And eat it like cheese, pass me the crackers please  
I've got a craving

There's nothin' left to do tonight  
But go crazy on you

Let me go crazy, crazy on you, oh  
Can't you see what you do to me baby,  
You make me crazy, you make me act like a maniac  
I'm like a lunatic, you make me sick  
You're truly the only one who can do this to me  
You just make me get so crazy  
I go schizo, I get so insane I just go schizophrenic  
One minute I want to slit your throat the next I want to sex  
You make me crazy  
The way we act like two maniacs in the sack  
We fuck like two jack rabbits and maybe that's a bad habit  
'Cause the next day we right back at it  
In the same exact pattern  
What the fuck is the matter with us  
We can't figure out if it's lust  
Or it's love which that is attractin' us to each other  
They say that every man grows up to marry his own mother  
Which would explain why you're such a motherfuckin' bitch  
But I stay and still stick it out with you  
Even though I just hit you today but you deserved it  
You hit me first and provoked me to choke you  
Just 'cause I came home late last night  
Crawled in bed and I woke you  
But if there's one thing about you that I admire  
It's baby, because you stay with me  
Maybe 'cause you're as crazy as I am  
'Cause when I look at you  
I can see an angel in your eyes but if I look deeper inside  
I see a freakish little side, like a devil in disguise  
You're always full of surprises  
Always pullin' devices out your purse, little vibrators and dildos  
You fucked yourself so much you barely feel those anymore  
You're only twenty four but you're plenty more mature  
Than those other little hoes who just act like little girls  
Like they're in middle school still you're crazy, sexy, cool  
Chill you play your position you never step out of line  
Even though I stay in your business  
You've always kept out of mine  
I wonder what's on your mind  
Sometimes they say love is blind  
Maybe that's why the first time I dotted your eye  
You didn't see the sign  
Or maybe you did maybe you like being shoved  
Maybe cause we're crazy in love  
  
Let me go crazy on you  
Crazy on you  
Let me go crazy, crazy on you, oh  
You are the ink to my paper  
What my pen is to my my pad  
The moral, the very fiber  
The whole substance to my rap  
You are my reason for being  
The meaning of my existence  
If it wasn't for you I would never be able to spit this  
As intense as I do, and the irony  
Is you rely on me as much  
As I rely on you to inspire me like you do  
You provide me the lighter fluid the fuel to my fire  
You're my entire supply of gas, the match and igniter  
The only way that I'm able to stay so stable  
Is you're the legs to my table,  
If you were to break I'd fall on my face  
But I'm always gonna make you feel  
I don't need you as much as I really need you  
So you don't use it to your advantage  
But you're essential to me  
You're the air I breathe  
I believe if you ever leave me  
I'd probably have no reason to be  
You are the Kim to my Marshall  
You're the Slim to my Shady  
The Dre to my Eminem  
The Alana to my Hailie  
You are the word that I'm lookin for  
When I'm tryin' to describe how I feel inside  
And the right one just won't come to my mind  
You're like the pillar that props me up  
The beam that supports me  
The bitch who never took half  
The wife who never divorced me  
You're like the root to my evil  
You let my devil come out me  
You let me beat the shit out you before you beat the shit out me  
And no matter how much too much is never enough  
Maybe 'cause we're crazy in love  
  
Let me go crazy on you  
Crazy on you  
Let me go Crazy, crazy on you oh

You can own this city  
Deep inside you hold the key  
While the world is fast asleep  
You can take it all if you just dare to dream  
  
Ever since Tony Montana told me that the world is mine  
I started to think positive  
Left the negative behind  
And while the other stars were fast asleep  
I had to rise and shine  
It's funny how I've got a brand new G shock on my wrist  
But I ain't got time to sit and talk about who slept with the most girls  
And who committed the most crime  
One day I had a dream like Martin  
Back when I had a homemade skinframe and a side parting  
They used to make jokes about me  
Now look who's laughing  
I'm sitting at the top of the game  
Love in my heart  
Jme on my chain  
Money on my head  
So it stays on my brain  
Till it turns me insane

And I can blow a hundred fast  
Like Usain Bolt like when he ran for Jamaica  
Me giving up is against the law  
I work hard  
I play more  
I fell in love with my sold out tour  
Sometimes I think some other artists love the after parties more  
Fell victim to the don beat  
So when I'm all counting paper  
Them man are just counting shit  
  
Yeah  
Yeah  
I was the boy in the corner  
Made a transition into a champion  
My discovery was televised  
I'm talking anthem after anthem  
Against all odds  
I made it look a walk in the park  
Now it's a brand new day  
And I'll be doin it again  
It's time for the main attraction  
  
You can own this city  
You have everything you need  
All it takes is all you got

(Else's lawn)  
(Else's lawn)  
Til' someone finally took me in my great aunt and uncle Edna and Charles  
(Edna and Charles)  
(Edna and Charles)  
(Edna and Charles)  
They were the ones who were left in charge  
My elementary they'd gang up on me and sing this song  
(Sing this song)  
(Sing this song)  
(Sing this song)  
It went a little something like  
Mary had a little lamb, little lamb, little lamb,  
Debbie had a Satan spawn Satan spawn  
Mama why do they keep saying this I just don't understand understand  
And by the way where's my dad?!  
  
[Chorus]  
Father please forgive me for I know not what I do  
I just never had the chance to ever meet you  
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be  
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds  
  
Predominately, predominately, everything's always predominately  
Predominately-white, predominately-black, well what about me?  
Where does that leave me?  
Well I guess that I'm between predominately both of em'  
I think if I hear that fuckin' word again I'm a scream  
While I'm projectile vomiting.  
What do I look like a Comedian to you?  
Do you think that I?m kidding?  
What do I look like some kinda idiot?  
Wait a minute shit, don?t answer that  
Why am I so misunderstood?  
Why do I go through so much bullshit  
It's such Bullshit it's tush mull bish  
Woe is me, there goes poor Marshall again  
Whining about his millions  
And his mansion and his sorrow he's always drowning in  
And the dad that he never had,  
And how his childhood was so bad  
And how his mom was a dope addict  
And his ex-wife how they go at it man  
I'd hate to have it as bad as that Mr. Mathers  
Claims he had it, I can't imagine it  
That little rich poor white bastard  
Needs to take some of that cash out of the bank  
And take a bath in it  
Man if I only had half of it,  
Shit if you only knew the half of it?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Evil deeds, while I plant these evil seeds  
Please release me from these demons I never  
Had any of this shit planned Mom please believe  
I don't wanna be Satans spawn, never got the chance to say I'm sorry  
Now look at all the pain I caused  
Dear Santa-Clause why are you not coming this year again  
What did I do that was so bad to deserve this?  
Everything could have been So perfect but life ain't a fairy tale.  
I'm about to be hoisted up in the air  
Forty feet below me there's people everywhere  
I don't even know but who feel like they know me 'cause I'm in this Ferris
wheel  
And all I wanna do is go to the mall and take Hallie on the carousel  
Without this crowd everywhere I go but life is like a merry-go-round  
Here we go now do-si-do now curtains up the show must go on now  
Ring-around-the-rosie the show's over you can all go home now  
But the curtain just don't close for me  
This ain't how fame was supposed to be  
Where's the switch I can just turn off-and-on this ain't what I chose to be  
So please God give me the strength  
To have what it takes to carry on  
'Til I pass 50 back the baton, the camera's on, my soul is gone

Ooh!  
Last one baby  
Lets Go

Sometimes I remenice at what we had  
Not knowin I was causing my baby to be sad  
I never once tried to cause you this pain  
Its crazy how one person can make you go insane  
Ill admit me and you we had our bad times  
We fought, yea but people act like it's a fuckin crime  
No couples perfect, everyone faces bullshit  
All I ever tried was to show you I loved you britt  
But it's sad cause the image I portray the pieces don't fit  
All this time how could it be, my destiny will never be you and me

Maybe that's the way I should go,  
Straight into the mouth of the unknown  
I left the spare key on the table  
Never really thought I'd be able to say  
I merely visit on the weekends  
I lost my whole life and a dear friend  
  
I've said it so many times  
I would change my ways  
No, nevermind  
God knows I've tried  
  
Call me a sinner, call me a saint  
Tell me it's over I'll still love you the same  
Call me your favorite, call me the worst  
Tell me it's over I don't want you to hurt  
It's all that I can say. So, I'll be on my way

Eminem:  
  
I got a letter from a girl  
Let me read it to you, goes like this  
  
Dear old rab my name is ashlee  
I'm writing to you 'cuz I'm hurt  
When people laughing at me  
  
I get made fun of  
All the time at school  
They call me fat worthless  
School is so cruel  
I hate when lunch time comes  
Coz' I sit alone  
I sit there with tears on my face  
Praying to go home  
But why go home?  
All I do there is cut my wrist  
Parents don't care that I do this shit  
No one loves me it's like  
I'm a piece of trash  
I don't get why god had to make me this fat  
No one would ever care  
If I took my life  
Everynight I get closer to the knife  
And I have to say this all sound about right  
I totally understand if you don't reply  
I just need someone to talk to  
And you seem to be a nice guy  
Believe me or not but your music  
Really helps me  
  
Call me a sinner, call me a saint  
Tell me it's over I'll still love you the same  
Call me your favorite, call me the worst  
Tell me it's over I don't want you to hurt  
It's all that I can say. So, I'll be on my way  
  
Eminem:  
  
First off I just wanna say thanks for writing to me  
Your story grabbed my heart as you can see  
They will stop soon just keep fighting  
Believe it or not we been in the same position  
But no one would help me either  
Either I should of listened  
But I promise we all have a vision  
We are here for a reason don't you forget that  
Pulled what's the matter whatcha become  
And let that face you your way to young  
If we could rebound stay strong  
Whenever your hurt just play this song  
Damn I get so mad  
So who are they to judge?  
There is to much hate  
Where is the frickin love  
Kiss these days just try to deguise it  
But not bring em back  
It's just lost now I wanna find it  
I wanna stop all this bullying shit  
Cuz all it's doing is putting innocent peoples lives at risk  
You wont a girl dead what's the point in all this!  
  
I finally put it all together,  
But nothing really lasts forever  
I had to make a choice that was not mine,  
I had to say goodbye for the last time  
I kept my whole life in suitcase,  
Never really stayed in one place  
Maybe that's the way it should be,  
You know I've led my life like a gypsy  
  
I've said it so many times  
I would change my ways  
No, nevermind  
God knows I've tried  
  
Call me a sinner, call me a saint  
Tell me it's over I'll still love you the same  
Call me your favorite, call me the worst  
Tell me it's over I don't want you to hurt  
It's all that I can say. So, I'll be on my way

"Who came through with two glocks to terrorize your borough (huh?)  
Told you how to slap dicks and murder your girl (I did!)  
Gave you all the finger and told you to sit and twirl  
Sold a billion tapes and still screamed, ""Fuck the world!""  
(I'm Slim Shady) so come and kill me while my name's hot  
And shoot me twenty-five times in the same spot (Ow!)  
I think I got a generation brainwashed  
To pop pills and smoke pot 'til they brains rot (uh-oh)  
Stop they blood flow until they veins clot  
I need a pain shot, and a shot of plain scotch  
Purple haze and acid raindrops  
Spike the punch at the party and drink pop (gulp gulp)  
Shaved my armpits and wore a tank top  
Bad Boy, I told you that I can't stop  
You gotta make 'em fear you 'fore you make 'em feel you  
So everybody buy my shit or I'm a come and kill you  
  
I got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets  
I'm your brother when you need, some good weed to set you free  
You know me, I'm your friend, when you need a mini-thin  
(I'm Slim Shady) I'm Shady!  
  
I like happy things,  
I'm really calm and peaceful (uh-huh huh)  
I like birds, bees, I like people  
I like funny things  
That make me happy and gleeful (he he he)  
Like when my teacher sucked my wee-wee in preschool (Woo!)  
The ill type, I stab myself with a steel spike  
While I blow my brain out, just to see what it feels like  
'Cause this is how I am in real life (mm-hm)  
I don't want to just die a normal death, I wanna be killed twice (uh-huh)  
  
How you gonna scare somebody with a gun threat  
When they high off of drugs they haven't even done yet (Huh?)  
So bring the money by tonight, cause your wife  
Said this the biggest knife she ever saw in her life (Help me! Help me!)  
I try to keep it positive and play it cool  
Shoot up the playground and tell the kids to stay in school (Stay in school!)  
'Cause I'm the one they can relate to and look up to better  
Tonight I think I'll write my biggest fan a fuck you letter  
  
I got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets  
I'm your brother when you need, some good weed to set you free  
You know me, I'm your friend, when you need a mini-thin

I listen to your demo tape and act like I don't like it  
(Aw that shit is wack!)  
Six months later you hear your lyrics on my shit  
(What? That's my shit!)  
People don't buy shit no more they just dub it  
That's why I'm still broke and had the number one club hit (Yup, uh huh)  
But they love it when you make your business public  
So fuck it, I've got herpes while we on the subject (uh-huh)  
And if I told you I had aid y'all would play it  
'Cause you stupid motherfuckers think I'm playin' when I say it  
Well, I do take pills, don't do speed  
Don't do crack (uh-uh) don't do coke, I do smoke weed (uh-huh)  
Don't do smack, I do do shrooms, do drink beer (yup)  
I just wanna make a few things clear  
My baby mama's not dead (uh-uh)  
She's still alive and bitchin' (yup)  
And I don't have herpes, my dick's just itchin'  
It's not syphilis, and as for being aids infested  
I don't know yet, I'm too scared to get tested  
  
I got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets  
I'm your brother when you need, some good weed to set you free

My stepfather said that I sucked in the bed  
'Til one night he snuck in and said  
We're going out back, I want my dick sucked in the shed  
Can't we just play with Teddy Ruxpin instead?  
After I fuck you in the butt, get some head  
Bust a nut, get some rest  
The next day my mother said ""I don't know what the fuck's up with this kid!  
The bastard won't even eat nothing he's fed  
He just hung himself in the bedroom he's dead""  
""Debbie don't let that fucker get you upset  
Go in there, stick a fuckin' cigarette to his neck  
I bet you he's fakin' it, I bet you  
I bet he probably just want's to see how upset you would get  
I'll go handle this of course, unless you object""

""Did you get him?"" Naaw, fucker tried to bite my face off  
I just got fuckin' chased off with a chainsaw  
Then he took the chainsaw, bit the fuckin' blades off  
Ate the blades, stuck a baseball in a slingshot  
Then he aimed at his own face, let the thing pop  
Took his eye out, picked it up and played ping pong  
Then he played ping pong with his own ding dong  
That motherfucker's got nuts like King Kong  
Then he set the lawn mower out on the dang lawn  
And he laid all up underneath it with the thing on  
Then he took his pants, he took every fuckin' thing off  
Everything, except his tank top and his training bra  
Ain't he raw? Yeah mainiac, that's Shady dog  
Man that motherfucker's gangsta, ain't he dog  
Shady dog, what be going through that fuckin' brain of yours  
Say no more, what the fuck you waitin' for, sing along

Don't you know what felch means? Yeah, well then tell me  
Would you rather get felched or do the felching  
Fuck him in the ass, suck the cum out while you're belching  
Burp, belch, then go back for a second helping  
Can you dig what I'm sayin' man, can you smell me?  
I want you to feel me like my step father felt me  
Fuck a little puppy, kick the puppy while he's yelping  
""Shady what the fuck you saying?"" I don't know help me!  
What the fuck's happening, I think I'm fucking melting

No Dad, I said no, I don't need no help peeing  
I'm a big boy, I can do it by myself see  
I only get naked when the baby sitter tells me  
She showed me a movie like ""Nightmare on Elm Street""

It's a rough week and I don't get enough sleep (I can't sleep)  
It's a long year pretending I belong here (Belong here)  
  
One day I plan to be a family man happily married  
I want to grow to be so old that I have to be carried  
'Til I'm glad to be buried  
And leave this crazy world  
  
And have at least a half a million for my baby girl  
It may be early to be planning this stuff  
'Cause I'm still struggling hard to be the man, and it's tough  
'Cause man it's been rough, but still I manage enough  
  
I've been taken advantage of, damaged and scuffed  
My hands have been cuffed  
But I don't panic and huff, frantic and puff  
Or plan to give up, the minute shit hits the fan it erupts  
  
I'm anteing up double or nothing, I've been trouble enough  
And I'm sick of struggling and suffering, see  
My destiny's to rest at ease, till I'm impressed and pleased  
With my progress, I won't settle for less than cheese  
  
I'm on a quest to seize all, my own label to call  
Way before my baby is able to crawl  
I'm too stable to fall, the pressure motivates  
To know I hold the weight of boulders on my shoulder blades  
  
I seen the golden gates to heaven on Earth  
Where they don't pull a weapon on you when you stepping on turf, Kyu

Everyday in the streets, scrambling and paying for cheep  
Praying for sleep  
Dreaming with a watering mouth  
  
Wishing for a better life for my daughter and spouse  
In this slaughtering house, caught up in bouts  
With the root of all evil  
I've seen it turn beautiful people crude and deceitful  
  
And make them do shit illegal  
For these Grant's and Jackson's  
These transactions explain a man's actions  
But in the mist of this insanity, I found my Christianity  
  
Through God and there's a wish he granted me  
He showed me how to cope with the stress  
And hope for the best, instead of mope and depressed  
Always groping a mess, of flying over the nest  
  
To selling dope with the rest  
I quit smoking cess to open my chest  
Life is stressful inside this cesspool  
Trying to wrestle, I almost bust a blood vessel  
  
My little brother's trying to learn his mathematics  
He's asthmatic, running home from school away from crack addicts  
Kids attract static, children with automatics  
Taking target practice on teens for Starter Jackets  
  
I'm using smarter tactics to overcome this slum  
I won't become as dumb as some and succumb to scum  
It's cumbersome, I'm trying to do well on this Earth  
But it's been Hell on this Earth since I fell on this Earth

Uh yeah, it's OK, it's alright, I can't sleep

I said get out bitch!  
(Let go of my hair, please don't do this baby)  
(Please I love you, look we can just take Hallie and leave)  
Fuck you, you did this to us  
You did it, it's your fault  
Oh my God I'm crackin' up  
Get a grip Marshall  
Hey remember the time we went to Brian's party?  
And you were like so drunk that you threw up all over Archie  
That was funny wasn't it?  
(Yes!)  
That was funny wasn't it?  
(Yes!)  
See it all makes sense, doesn't it?  
You and your husband have a fight  
One of you tries to grab a knife  
And during the struggle he accidentally gets his Adams apple sliced  
(No!)  
And while this is goin' on  
His son just woke up and he just walks in  
She panics and he gets his throat cut  
(Oh my God!)  
So now they both dead and you slash your own throat  
So now it's double homicide and suicide with no note  
I should have known better when you started to act weird  
We could've, hey! where you going? get back here!  
You can't run from me Kim  
It's just us, nobody else!  
You're only making this harder on yourself  
Ha! ha! got you!  
(Ah!)  
Ha! go ahead yell!  
Here I'll scream with you!  
Ah somebody help!  
Don't you get it bitch, no one can hear you?  
Now shut the fuck up and get what's comin' to you  
You were supposed to love me  
Now bleed! bitch bleed!  
Bleed! bitch bleed! bleed!

"Look,  
If you had  
One shot,  
Or one opportunity  
To seize everything you ever wanted  
In one moment  
Would you capture it  
Or just let it slip?  
  
Yo  
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy  
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti  
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready  
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin'  
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud  
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out  
He's chokin', how, everybody's jokin' now  
The clocks run out, times up, over, blaow!  
Snap back to reality, oh there goes gravity  
Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked  
He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy? No  
He won't have it, he knows his whole back city's ropes  
It don't matter, he's dope, he knows that, but he's broke  
He's so stacked that he knows, when he goes back to his mobile home, that's
when its  
Back to the lab again yo, this whole rhapsody  
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment  
You own it, you better never let it go  
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow  
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better  
  
The souls escaping, through this hole that its gaping  
This world is mine for the taking  
Make me king, as we move toward a, new world order  
A normal life is borin', but super stardom's close to post mortar  
It only grows harder, only grows hotter  
He blows us all over these hoes is all on him  
Coast to coast shows, he's known as the globetrotter  
Lonely roads, God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father  
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter  
But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water  
His hoes don't want him no mo, he's cold product  
They moved on to the next schmo who flows, he nose dove and sold nada  
So the soap opera is told and unfolds, I suppose it's old partna, but the beat
goes on  
Da da dumb da dumb da da  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
No more games, I'm a change what you call rage  
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged  
I was playin' in the beginnin', the mood all changed  
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage  
But I kept rhymin' and stepwritin' the next cipher  
Best believe somebody's payin' the pied piper  
All the pain inside amplified by the  
Fact that I can't get by with my nine to  
Five and I can't provide the right type of  
Life for my family 'cause man, these God damn food stamps don't buy diapers  
And its no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer,  
This is my life and these times are so hard  
And it's getting even harder tryin' to feed and water my seed, plus  
See dishonor caught up between bein' a father and a prima-donna,  
Baby mama drama screamin' on and too much  
For me to want to say in one spot, another jam or not  
Has gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail I've got  
To formulate a plot fore I end up in jail or shot  
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failures not  
Mom, I love you, but this trail has got to go, I cannot grow old in Salem's
lot  
So here I go is my shot.  
Feet fail me not 'cause maybe the only opportunity that I got  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
You can do anything you set your mind to, man

"A distant alarm, a sound from far away  
We raised our heads towards the sky but there was nothing there to see  
The restless crowd is now breaking the silence  
Anxiety is rising, the sky is turning dark  
A riot is emerging, men beat men to death  
This is unexplainable, a fight without a battle  
The alarm resounds and someone called in a speaker:  
""This is not a drill, I repeat: this is not a drill...""  
  
Today we die, today we testify  
All we do must come to an end - this is the end  
  
Reversed evolving, turning people into beasts  
They're feasting on eachother, strong consume the weak  
Flaming ruins, society is lost  
Shattered city streets filled with blind, nameless creatures  
The sky cracks open, dust is descending  
Breath the black air, feel darkness in your lungs  
Silence - nothing makes a sound  
But we can still hear, the sound of the alarm  
  
Today we die, today we testify  
All we do must come to an end - this is the end  
  
A distant early warning  
A sound from far away  
We raised our heads  
Towards the sky  
Towards the alarm...

You don't see me in the hood, it's cause I'm doing this man  
  
Niggas, I'm still grinding (yeah), I still hearing those sirens  
I'm still getting chased by those lights  
Only the light's lime, and my mic's on  
And my time is none, because I'm writing more  
I don't hear to meet a soul in this business  
I'm here to eat, speak, until these ho's feel this  
I ain't gonna let you derail me, man  
I got Young Kobe homey, you gotta let go of Obie  
Cause Obie be back, (going nowhere, man) we got them craps going on  
And that yak going on, soon as a nigga touch down, back from town  
It's forever, put that on the cheddar, man  
But in the meantime, it's Jimmy Iovine time  
Chase cheese, rhyme 'til my voice give out  
This is it my niggas, this what we boast about  
Now I'm here, so shut your motherfucking mouth, and show me love, bitch  
  
[Chorus]  
I just want to love, for the rest of my life (I don't love you, bitch)  
I want to hold you in the morn, hold you thorough the night

we don't love no bitches, though)

My poetry's deep, and I'm still-matic, the way I flow to this beat  
You can't sit still, it's like trying to smoke crack and go to sleep  
I'm strapped, it's known any minute I could snap  
I'm the equivalent of what would happen if Bush rapped  
I bully these rappers so bad lyrically  
It ain't even funny, I ain't even hungry, it ain't even money  
You can't pay me enough for you to play me  
It's cockamamie you just ain't zany enough to rock with Shady  
My noodle is cock-a-doodle, my clock's coo-coo  
I got screws loose, yea the whole kit and caboodle, I'm just brutal  
It's no rumor, I'm numero uno, assume it, there's no more humor in it, you

You need a fag and tear a new hole in my ass, you better love me, bitch

Nine eleven Porsche same color as cranberry sauce  
I ain't gon' front, I thought R. Kelly was the shit

Niggas eating popcorn, right, rewinding the tape  
Now shorty mama in the precinct hollering rape  
I'm convinced, man, something really wrong with these ho's  
I thought Lil' Kim was hot, 'til she start fucking with her nose  
I used to listen to Lauryn Hill, and tap my feet  
Then the bitch put out a CD and didn't have no beats

"Just gonna stand there and watch me burn  
But that's alright, because I like the way it hurts  
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry  
But that's alright, because I love the way you lie  
I love the way you lie  
  
I can't tell you what it really is  
I can only tell you what it feels like  
And right now there's a steel knife, in my windpipe  
I can't breathe, but I still fight, while I can fight  
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight  
High off of love drunk from my hate  
It's like I'm huffing paint and I love it the more that I suffer  
I suffocate and right before I'm about to drown  
She resuscitates me, she fucking hates me,  
And I love it, wait  
Where you going, I'm leaving you  
No you ain't, come back  
We're running right back, here we go again  
It's so insane 'cause when it's going good, it's going great  
I'm Superman, with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane  
But when it's bad, it's awful  
I feel so ashamed, I snapped, who's that dude  
I don't even know his name, I laid hands on her  
I'll never stoop so low again, I guess I don't know my own strength  
  
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn  
But that's alright, because I like the way it hurts  
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry  
But that's alright, because I love the way you lie  
I love the way you lie  
I love the way you lie  
  
You ever love somebody so much  
You can barely breathe, when you're with them, you meet  
And neither one of you, even know what hit 'em,  
Got that warm fuzzy feeling, yeah them chills, used to get 'em  
Now you're getting fucking sick, of looking at 'em  
You swore you've never hit 'em, never do nothing to hurt 'em,  
Now you're in each others face,  
Spewing venom, and these words, when you spit 'em  
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em,  
Throw 'em down, pin 'em, so lost in the moments, when you're in 'em  
It's the rage that's the culprit, it controls you both  
So they say it's best, to go your separate ways,  
Guess that they don't know ya 'cause today, that was yesterday  
Yesterday is over, it's a different day  
Sound like broken records, playin' over, but you promised her  
Next time you'll show restraint  
You don't get another chance,  
Life is no Nintendo game, but you lied again  
Now you get to watch her leave,  
Out the window, guess that's why they call it window pane  
  
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn  
But that's alright, because I like the way it hurts  
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry  
But that's alright, because I love the way you lie  
I love the way you lie  
I love the way you lie  
  
Now I know we said things, did things  
That we didn't mean and we fall back into the same patterns  
Same routine, but your temper's just as bad, as mine is  
You're the same as me, but when it comes to love, you're just as blinded  
Baby please come back, it wasn't you,  
Baby it was me, maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems  
Maybe that's what happens When a tornado meets a volcano  
All I know is I love you too much, to walk away now  
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk  
Don't you hear sincerity, in my voice when I talk,  
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball  
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the dry wall  
Next time, there will be no next time  
I apologize even though I know it's lies  
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar  
If she ever tries to fucking leave again  
I'm a tie her to the bed and set this house on fire  
  
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn  
But that's alright, because I like the way it hurts  
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry  
But that's alright, because I love the way you lie  
I love the way you lie  
I love the way you lie

"Maxine!  
  
Hello  
Can I speak to Maxine?  
Yeah this is me what's up?  
What up?  
  
Who dis?  
Denaun  
Yeah what's up?  
What are you doing?  
  
Nothing just laying in bed  
Huh?  
Nothing just laying in bed  
Why?  
  
I don't know thinking about something freaky to do  
  
I know this crack fiend Maxine who needs a vaccine  
She tests positive but tells you that her act's clean  
Plus she got a sugar daddy  
Asking every hooker that he takes in to crook her badly  
  
If you mistook her sadly, on her reputation  
You're in jepordation, if you ain't got no preparation  
When you step away son, she got her face done  
Looking provocative, she'll let you knock it if  
  
You press the issue and get undressed to kiss you  
If you match the price, otherwise she won't look at you twice  
But when you catch the lice, or get the urgency  
To go to the emergency cause it burns to pee  
  
Don't bring your germs to me, cause I ain't trying to hear it  
While your fighting you fucking disease trying to clear it (Maxine!!)  
  
Sometimes I wonder, what's your purpose? In life that is  
To get with every brother and unveil one of his kids, shit  
You living trife, got three kids at home and club hopping every night  
You say it's gonna stop but it.. just.. slows.. down  
  
And then speeds back to a regular pace, there is no end to this  
Mystery, whatever your reason even is to be  
You say you want to be with me, but how can you say that  
When you got niggas hiding in your closet  
I refrain from getting angry but you keep on that strangely  
  
I met this girl last week, she was a freak, and she liked me  
So I stepped on it and then asked my homies  
And chilled on the side and then watched they niggas  
Big game over there and take notes, while I get this number  
  
I stepped to her first I cleared my throat and said ""Hey Bitch..  
Haven't I seen you before?"", looked at my nigga  
Turned around and got slapped throughout my hands  
And said ""Oh it's like that?""  
  
She said she just broke up with her nigga and shit  
She started crying, and asked me to forgive her and shit  
She said her name was Maxine, so I told her I wanted her number  
She asked could I give her mine too  
  
Got to the crib and called her up  
We got into a good conversation that's when she asked me could I fuck  
I said ""Maxine check this out,  
Give me your address I'll be through and you'll find out""  
  
Got to the crib she let me in  
She didn't waste time she grabbed my hand and proceeded to the bedroom  
I said ""Hold up, and stop proceeding, you rushing things.  
What the fuck are you doing?""  
  
So I went for my protection, took off my clothes and started flexing  
As she went for my midsection  
I threw her down as I tore off her shirt  
Pulled out my jimmy and I thought about putting in work  
  
Before I hit it she said  
""3 don't get mad but there's something that I gotta tell your ass""  
I said ""What is it, another nigga? It's ok""  
She said ""No I forgot to tell you, that I got AIDS""  
I got up out  
  
Hey, Maxine  
What  
You thinking about sucking my dick?  
Yeah for a small price  
  
For a small price? What you mean?  
You know, money nigga  
You don't need no damn money,  
I can't give you no money anyways, I heard you got some shit.  
  
What you, what you hear I got?  
AIDS  
Who told you that bullshit?  
My nigga Kyu, he wouldn't lie  
  
Well if that's the case, Kyu got it then  
Oh for real, it's like that?  
Well I ain't got shit,  
So he ain't got shit, and if he do, he ain't get that shit from me,  
I ain't fucking around with no 3rd nigga  
  
Fuck that, I ain't fucking with you  
No, see..

I pray for the day that someone who spits with the calliber that nas and jay
does  
Opens up his jaw to say something or rattle my name off  
Or rattle the first thing from the top of his brain off  
So I can blow the fuckin dust off of this chainsaw  
And give him the surgery that he came for  
Till I pull the paint off  
I never been shot  
But I think me and 50 musta been cut from the same cloth  
Cause I've always came off  
Like ja's chain  
When they try to rush him and lost  
And came back and gave him a watch in exchange for it  
I don't stop  
The only thing I wait for  
Is day that I don't gotta report to probate court  
Cause ima give ya all the reason to hate more  
Cause I've been holding my tongue till I got a sprained jaw  
A lot of rappers on my list that just ain't ja  
And ima read that motherfucker off from April  
You pussies think I went soft since 8 mile  
When I come back ill be shootin more than just paint balls

Fuck a peace plan, if a citizen bystands

And for what yo' life's worth, this money is twice than  
You grab a couple grand and lay up in Iceland  
See I'm a nice man but money turned me to Satan  
I'm thirsty for this green so bad I'm dehydratin'  
Hurry up with the cash bitch, I got a ride waitin'  
Shot a man twice in the back when he tried escapin'  
I want the whole pie, I won't be denied Nathan  
Maybe I need my head inside straightened  
Brain contemplatin', clean out the register  
Dip before somebody catches ya  
Or gets ya description and sketches ya  
Then connects you as the prime suspect  
But I ain't set to flee the scene of the crime just yet  
'Cause I got a daughter to feed  
And two hundred dollars ain't enough to water the seed, the best thing  
Would be for me to leave Taco Bell and hit up Chess King  
And have the lady at the desk bring  
Money from the safe in the back, stepped in wavin' the Mac  
Cooperate and we can operate and save an attack  
This bitch tried escapin' the jack  
Grabbed her by the throat, it's murder she wrote  
You barely heard a word as she choked  
It wasn't nothin' for her to be smoked  
Then I slammed her on her back 'til her vertebrae broke  
Just then the pigs bust in yellin' ""Freeze!""  
But I'm already wanted for sellin' Ki's  
And bunch of other felonies from A to Z like spellin' bees  
So before I dropped to the ground and fell on knees  
I bust shots, they bust back  
Hit the square in the chest, he wasn't wearin' a vest  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Left the house, pullin' out the drive backin' out  
We were backin' out this lady's Jag started blackin' out  
Pulled the Mac-10 out, stuck it in her face  
Shut ya yakkin' mouth,  
'fore I blow the brain from out the back ya scalp  
Drug her by her hair, smacked her up  
Thinkin' fuck it, mug her while you're there, jacked her up  
Stole her car, made a profit  
Grabbed the tape from out the deck and offed it out the window  
Like the girl on ""Set it Off"" did  
Jetted off kid, stole the whip, now I'm a criminal  
Drove it through somebody's yard, dove into they swimmin' pool  
Climbed out and collapsed on the patio  
I made it out alive but I'm injured badly though  
Parents screamin', ""Son, go in and call the police  
Tell 'em there's a crazy man disturbing all of the peace!""  
Tried to stall him at least long enough to let me leap up  
Run in they crib and at least leave with some little cheap stuff  
Actin' like they never seen nobody hit a lick before  
Smashed the window, grabbed the Nintendo sixty four  
When they sell out in stores the price triples  
I ran up the block jumpin' kids on tricycles  
And collided with an eighty-year old lady with groceries  
There goes the cheese, eggs, milk and Post Toasties  
Stood up and started to see stars  
Too many siren sounds, it seemed like a thousand police cars  
Barely escaped, musta been some dumb luck  
Jumped up and climbed the back of a movin' dump truck  
But I think somebody seen me maybe  
Plus I lost the damn Nintendo and I must-a dropped the Beanie Baby  
Fuck it I give up, I'm surrounded in blue suits  
Came out with a white flag hollerin' ""truce truce!""  
(Don't shoot!) Surrendered my weapon to cops  
Wasn't me!  
It was the gangsta rap and the peppermint Schnapps  
  
[Chorus: x2]

"
"Yo, yeah girl,  
Can you hear that? It's playing our song  
Are you sleepy? Take a nap  
You're not afraid of the dark? Are you?  
  
You hear the beat as it makes ya not wanna go to sleep  
I knock on Dakota's door, its locked so I go to creep  
Round the back, with binoculars, not cause I wanna peep  
But because I'm hungry she smells like tacos I wanna eat  
Visions of hot chocolaty marshmallows are so sweet  
With sugar plums, oh look here comes Marshall he's on your street  
He's placing hot smoldering charcoals beneath your feet  
Now walk on 'em, he's dancing with carcasses cheek to cheek  
Like a Thanksgiving turkey, or holiday ham  
Cinnamon sprinkled on toast, strawberry marmalade jam  
Flavor my favorite graham crackers with Jon Benet Ramsey  
I guess a modern day Jack the Ripper is all that I am  
  
[Chorus]  
(My music box)  
Cos when the lights are off, I see the girls asleep (My music box)  
But I can hear you my love, you keep calling me (My music box)  
And when we're world's apart, you mean the world to me (My music box)  
If you call, I'll come, I will answer (My music box)  
Cos when the lights are off, I see the girls asleep (My music box)  
I hear my music box, playing a song for me (My music box)  
So when she twirls around do a whirl for me (My music box)  
Won't you be my private little dancer (My music box)  
  
I almost look comatose, who wants to be sober gross  
I foam like a Doberman, mouth open I overdose  
Put coke up my nostrils, in both my holes and I plug my nose  
My pupils quadruple in size, eyes are so bugged I know  
I put on my mother's make up, get naked and run around  
Wavin' the gun around, I think I'm down to a hundred pounds  
There's thunder, I wonder how come it rains but the sun is out  
The devils upset with his wife, they must be sluggin' it out  
I must be buggin' the fuck out, but what the fuck about?  
Voices are leading me up to the attic, I love my house  
They pull and they tug my blouse, the sound of a music box  
Comes from inside a toy chest, but what do I do, it's locked  
I pick it and open it but it's stuffed full of human parts  
I dig till I find it, I wind it up and the tune just starts  
Its playing a song, so beautiful and the room is dark  
The moon is full, I smell a funeral, guess I'll loom in the park  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm fixated on asphyxiating and breakin' this little chick's  
Neck like a pixie stick  
The sick Satan worshippin', bitches get horse-whippin's,  
I'm in the back, through the back door, slip in  
Through the crack leavin' the corpse drippin'  
The mortician of love, sent from above,  
Forced and treat 'em all ? stingy I've become  
Been doin' this for more than a quarter century, I'm just numb  
Am I dreamin', is it real? Someone pinch me on the buns  
The time has come to tie her up, gotta roll me the ladder  
I'd had enough of the chatter, climb up to the window, look at her  
Then climb in and slowly shatter her brain matter and batter her  
With the bat, a matter of fact that will splatter her  
But before I do that, I'll have a chat to flatter her  
Give her two compliments, back-to-back, like Tabatha  
I'm your secret admirer, I'm back to ravish ya  
So strong is your fight, but your no match for Dracula  
Prolonging her plight, as I go back to stabbin' her  
Dismember her limbs, simple as that, cadaver her  
Zoom in with the lens, then pan back, the camera  
Stand back, cause here comes your man Jack, so Pamela  
  
[Chorus]

"
"Yea, (oh, oh), yea yea, oh  
  
I feel like dancing  
I feel like dancing  
  
I smell something in the air that's making me (high)  
I said I smell something in the air that's making me high  
  
Ok here we go, do-re-mi-fa-so, I'm so la-di-da so  
Lyrical rise flow, give back the tobasco  
You motherfuckers mustsanot know the tic tac songs  
Time to show you the mo kick ass flow in the cosmos  
Picasso with a pick axe a sick asshole  
She tac toe frozen six pack with exacto  
Knives, strangling wives with pig lasso  
Few bags of the the grass, zig zags, I'm with the doc so  
You know how that go, skull and the crossbones  
This is poison, the boys and girls who do not know  
You do not want to try this at home my novato (novice)  
This is niether the time or the place to get macho  
So crack a six pack, sit back with some nachos  
Maybe some popcorn, and watch the show and just rock slow  
It's not what you expected, tho what you thought though  
Bout time to you wake the fuck up smell the pot smoke  
  
[Chorus]  
It must be the ganja  
It's the marijuana  
That's creeping upon me while I'm so high  
Maybe it's the hindi that has gotten in me  
Whatever's gotten into me I don't mind  
  
It must be the ganja  
It's the marijuana  
That's creeping upon me while I'm so high  
Maybe it's the hindi that has gotten in me  
Whatever's got into me I don't mind  
  
Your dreams of getting the pill, you are literally getting the chills  
Spitting at will, me and Dre have just finished splitting a pill  
You're submitting to skill, sitting still, I'm admitting, I'm beginning to
feel  
Like I don't think anyone's real,  
Faced with a dilemma, I can be Dali Llama and become a bin gramma a step
beyond a Jeffrey Dahmer  
Please don't upset me mama, you lookin sexy mama,  
Don't know if this the lala or the rum and pepsi mama  
Don't want to end up inside my refrigerator freezer,  
Be used as extra topping the next time I make a pizza  
How many people you know can name every serial killer who ever existed in a
row,  
Put em in chronological order beginning with Jack the Ripper,  
Name the time and place from the body the bag the zipper,  
Location of the woods where the body was dragged and then dumped,  
The trunk that they were stuffed in, the model the make the plate  
And which motel which lake they found her in,  
And how they attacked the victim,  
Say which murder weapon was used to do what and which one,  
Which night it was done, what kid would write there was none,  
So sloppy like this it's fun, the fuckin ecstasy goes  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When I'm behind a mic dynamite is what it's kinda like  
Get stuck with that same stick that you're trying to light  
Behind the boards is Dre, legends are made this way  
Isn't it safe to say, this is the way it should be?  
Maybe you need some lyric syrup sign for your symptoms  
Heres a dosage of the antidote now you give him some,  
He can give her some, she can give him some  
Get behind a lynn drum, make up a beat and kill the sucka syndrome  
You're spitting drama when it comes to lyrics and penance I'm  
Starting from scratch and then ending up at the end ending up  
Capable of bringing a bullets a stillunbelievable bullets a  
Titanium brain that's full of, surprises  
When the smoke rises right before your very own eyes  
You stare into your stereos eyes  
Good evening, this ain't even a weed thing,  
I ain't even smoke anything, I ain't even drink anything  
  
[Chorus]

"Daddy what are you doing?  
Okay then!  
Everybody listen up!  
I'm goin' to hell!  
Who's comin' with me?  
Somebody please help him!  
I think my dad's gone crazy  
  
There's no mountain I can't climb, there's no tower too high,  
No plane that I can't learn how to fly  
What do I gotta do to get through to you,  
To show you there ain't nothin' I can't take this chainsaw to?  
Fuckin' brains, brawn and brass balls, I cut'em off,  
And got'em pickled and bronzed in a glass jar inside of a hall  
With my framed autographed sunglasses with Elton John's name on my drag wall,  
I'm out the closet, I've been lyin' my ass off  
All this time me and Dre been fuckin' with hats off (Suck it, Marshall).  
So tell Laura and her husband to back off  
Before I push this motherfuckin' button and blast off  
And launch one at these Russians and that's all  
Blow every fuckin' thing except Afghanistan on the map off.  
When will it stop? When will I knock the crap off?  
Hailie, tell 'em baby,  
My Dad's Lost It!  
  
[Chorus]  
There's really nothin' else to say, I, I can't explain it  
I think my dad's gone crazy  
A little help from Hailie Jade, won't you tell 'em baby  
I think my dad's gone crazy  
There's nothin' you could do or say that could ever change me  
I think my dad's gone crazy  
There's no one on earth that can save me, not even Hailie  
I think my dad's gone crazy  
  
It's like my mother always told me and codeine and  
Goddammit you little motherfucker  
If you ain't got nothin' nice to say then don't say nothin'  
Uh, fuck that shit bitch eat a motherfuckin' dick,  
Chew on a prick and lick  
A million mutherfuckin' cocks per second,  
I'd rather put out a mutherfuckin' Gospel record  
I'd rather be a pussy whipped bitch, eat pussy,  
And have pussy lips glued to my face  
With a clit ring in my nose then quit bringin' my flows  
Quit givin' me my ammo. Can't you see why I'm so mean?  
If y'all leave me alone this wouldn't be my M.O.  
I wouldn't have to go, eenee, meenee, meini, mo,  
Catch a homo by his toe, man I don't know no more  
Am I the only fuckin' one who's normal any more?  
Dad  
  
[Chorus]  
  
My songs can make you cry, take you by surprise at the same time,  
Can make you dry your eyes with the same rhyme  
See what you're seein' is a genius at work, which to me isn't work,  
So it's easy to misinterpret it at first  
'Cause when I speak, it's tongue-in-cheek,  
I'd yank my fuckin' teeth before I'd ever bite my tongue  
I'd slice my gums, get struck by fuckin' lightning twice at once  
And die and come back as Vanilla Ice's son  
And walk around the rest of my life spit on,  
And kicked and hit with shit every time  
I sung like R. Kelly as soon as ""Bump and Grind"" comes on.  
More pain inside of my brain than the eyes of a little girl  
Inside of a plane aimed at the World Trade, standin' on Ronnie's grave,  
Screamin' at the sky, 'til clouds gather, it's Clyde Mathers and Bonnie Jade  
And that's pretty much the gist of it, the parents are pissed but the kids
love it.  
Nine millimeter heater stashed in two seaters with meat cleavers  
I don't blame you, I wouldn't let Hailie listen to me neither

I never meant to give you mushrooms girl  
I never meant to bring you to my world  
Now you sitting in the corner crying  
And now its my fault (My fault)  
  
I went to Johns rave with Ron and Dave  
And met a new wave blond babe with half of her head shaved  
A nurse aid who came to get laid and tied up  
With first aid tape and raped on the first date  
Susan an ex heroin addict who just stopped using  
She loved booze and alternative music  
Told me she was going back to using again  
I said wait first try this hallucinogen  
Its better then heroin and booze and gin  
Come here lets go in here  
Who's in the den? (Its me and Kelly)  
My bad lets try another room (I don't trust you)  
Shut up slut chew up this mushroom  
This will help you get in touch with your roots  
Walking barefoot butt naked and run in the woods  
(Oh hell I might as well try them this party is so drag)  
Oh dag I didn't mean for you to eat the whole bag (Uh)  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Yo Sue (Get away from me I don't know you)  
Oh shoot she's tripping (I need to go puke)  
I wasn't trying to turn this into something major  
I just wanted to make you appreciate nature  
Susie stop crying I don't hate ya  
The world is not against you  
I am sorry your father raped you  
So you had your little coochie in your dad's mouth  
That ain't no reason to start wiggin' and spaz out  
She said (Help me I think I am having a seizure)  
I said I am high too bitch  
Quit grabbing my t-shirt (Let go)  
Would you calm down you are starting to scare me  
She said (I am 26 years old and I am not married I don't even have any  
Kids and I can't cook)  
I am over here Sue  
You are talking to the plant  
Look we need to get to a hospital  
Before it is too late  
'Cause I never seen one eat as many 'shrooms as you ate  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Susie where you going you better be careful  
(leave me alone dad I am sick of getting my hair pulled)  
I am not your dad  
And try not to swallow your tongue  
Want some gum?  
Put down the scissors before you do something dumb  
I will be right back just chill baby please?  
I got to go find Dave he is the one who gave me these  
John where's Dave at before I bash you  
He's in the bathroom  
I think he is taking a crap dude  
Dave pull up your pants  
We need an ambulance  
There's a girl upstairs talking to plants  
Chopping her hair off  
And there's only two days left of spring break  
How long do these things take to wear off?  
Well it depends on how may you've had  
I took 3 she had the other 22 caps  
Now she is upstairs crying out her eye balls  
Drinking Lysol (She is going to die dude)  
I know and its my fault (My god)

And I'm for the green yeah somethin like a Celtics fan  
Me and my team came in G4 dozen seaters  
Just in time, call us the buzzer beaters  
It's big shot Fab, I spin like vinyl records  
You could tell I want the ball in the final seconds  
I keep some change on me

My hommies got a soft one, throw me in a lob one  
Good on the first three, I'm Kobe on this fourth one

No games played your boy dropped through like the????  
In the passenger I'm mashin'em  
Dunkin off the glass on'em  
These other players with full court press harassin'em  
Yeah I'm in the zone  
Colors in the stones  
They look, they hook'em sorta like they playbook  
That's the flagrant foul that could get you a suspension  
They want me to dunk on'em just to get them some attention

White and gold gleam on the whole team  
I spin like a mixer  
Sorta like a trickster

I beg your pardon I should live with the guards  
I spend my time point guardin'  
Amx black car, nothin with the plastic

Look, I can see them niggas stuntin to this right now, not now, but right now  
Yea, yea, ch-ch-yea  
Look, lo-lo look  
Look, lo-lo look  
Look, look  
  
[Fabolous]  
It's no love for the other side, fuck all the tricks  
Pop the glove on the other side, buck through the bricks  
Birds love how a brother ride, truckin it sick  
I'm heard of on the southern side, i pluck through it quick  
I been one of them boys since way back when  
This is way before a nigga brought grey plaques in  
So if i spray mac-10s, Bet you niggas lay back then  
Like you sittin in a Maybach Benz  
Yea I made crack grins but ain't a damn thing funny  
I keep a pocket fulla do the damn thang money  
I keep it comin with bottles of champagne dunny  
So keep it bouncin till you pull a hamstring honey  
These pimps just better have a gothic for me  
I got them hoes starin like they got a problem with me  
I got them boys slingin rocks in the lobby for me  
I'm rich bitch, ballin just a hobby for me  
  
[Chorus]  
I got a pocket full of money and my wrist all froze  
So fuck what you heard we don't love them hoes, heeyyy  
Do the damn thang, do the damn thang  
A nigga might grin but it ain't still funny  
Got a pocket fulla that, do the damn thang money, heeyy  
Do the damn thang, do the damn thang  
  
[Young Jeezy]  
My phone is tapped and so is my livin room  
We can't hide the money here, we need a bigger room  
Let me show you what I stand fo,  
Jesus Schwarzenegger call me commando  
On that Remy Martin, nigga matta fact  
I ain't Fat Joe but I can make em lean back  
Save your ammo don't waste it  
Got him dodgin bullets like he in the matrix  
Jeans strapped and ya better dip  
Carvin 15, got six clips  
Pilsbury nigga, got a lotta dough  
Call me bossan george, got a lotta hoes  
They place orders, so I bake cakes  
I'm a bodybuilder, pump a lotta weight  
You see the diamonds in my damn chain  
It ain't hard to tell, I do the damn thang  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Fabolous]  
You waitin instead of participatin with them boys  
You skatin on them 22 datins like them boys  
I'm hatin that they communicatin with them boys  
I'm waitin just to send them to Satan for that shit  
They see a nigga stones look sick  
And I gotta stack of singles in my hand that's phone booth thick  
'Cause I'm so hood rich  
That I'm no good bitch  
And even if she gotta pimp then a hoe should switch  
And get ridda that shit spitta, get wit her, shit gitter  
sit wit her, hit spitter, that don't bitch chitter  
My style fit wit her  
I tell her you don went left now you need to go right like a switch hitta  
I know them tricks bitter  
When I'm in the six with her  
So I'm in a mix with her  
forty four six with her  
And I'm higher than a motherfucker  
But a nigga try then he gon die in this motherfucker

"
"It's been a year and some change  
And I've been hearin' some things  
That there's some motherfuckers tryin' to be me  
But ain't none of these motherfuckers tryin' to see me  
So I won't stop, and I don't stop, yeah  
  
It's like everywhere I look and everywhere I go  
I'm hearin' muh'fucka's tryin'a steal my flow  
But it ain't no thing cause see my nigga J.O  
Put me up on the game when I stepped through the do'  
Now I done been so many places and seen so many faces  
But none of these motherfuckers do it like me  
Don't no motherfuckin' click do it like we  
Guess I'm doin' the right thing like Spike Lee  
See they talk like they some ho's, I walk like I'm supposed  
But if they get in the way they get stepped on  
It's the hundred-thou with the bling kept on  
Dippin' on my semi-automatic weap-on  
I ain't playin' no games, and I ain't sayin' no names  
Nigga put the shoes on if they fit you  
Well there's two things that I'm gon' admit to  
That I won't stop, and I don't stop  
  
[Chorus:]  
It don't stop  
And it won't stop  
And it don't stop  
It don't stop, it won't stop  
It don't stop  
And it won't stop  
And it don't stop  
It don't stop, it won't stop  
  
I take whatever come wit the wealth, and even humble myself  
But I ain't the kinda nigga you can style on  
I got a coupe that I'm finna' put some miles on  
And I ride on these niggaz wit a smile on  
See I'm 'bout stackin' money but when they start actin' funny  
I fall back and all a man do is laugh  
I'm the kinda player that ain't gotta do the draft  
Buncha hits, couple plaques nigga do the math  
But a nigga must be gone for gettin' his hustle on  
So I had to come through and take the corner back  
And I'm back wit the rubber bands on a stack  
Nigga quit or take what I give on a pack  
Girls still think I'm fly  
Blow kiss and wink the eye  
And tell me they want to go somewhere and freak off  
I tell 'em I would love to stop and take the week off  
But I won't stop, and I don't stop  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
I listen to niggaz flippin' my lines  
And be grippin' my nine  
Like damn niggaz flip and only spit game  
Niggaz comin' at me tryin' to get names  
Niggaz lookin like me tryin' to get fame  
See first it didn't matter, and I was a little flattered  
But now these young boys they gettin' too grown  
Like I ain't show 'em how to rock jewels two toned  
But it won't stop, and it don't stop  
Yeah  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
It's like everywhere I look and everywhere I go  
I'm hearin' muh'fucka's tryin'a steal my flow  
But it ain't no thing cause see my nigga J.O.

"[Verse 1 - Paul Cain]  
Damn ma  
I love you like a lie  
I get a rush from your touch, sort of like a high  
I used to adore your presence but now I'm like goodbye  
Kept it a hundred with you... what give you the right to lie?  
We in two different spaces, and you done turned gemini  
Completely changed faces  
You wouldn't understand even if we trade places  
You'll never find another me, face it!  
  
[Broadway]  
My life ain't sweet  
I don't know who told you that?  
My shoes, might want to tiptoe in that  
Walk slow with that  
I'm the same, ain't changed  
But the hate where home is at  
Got me like damn, where my homies at?  
Fuck it, it's just me  
Can't hold me back  
You just can't bite the hand that feeds you  
Especially when the hand's illegal  
I got you cold  
Consider it a lesson learned  
I'm guessing it was just my turn  
To learn the hard way  
You can't always trust the ones you love  
  
[Hook]  
Oh yeah I think I remember you  
Yeah ahhh probably not  
You look so familiar too...  
But you just wouldn't do this to me  
I know you just wouldn't do this to me  
Not you, I'm sorry, I must have you confused  
  
[Verse 2 - fabolous]  
You got to take the good with the bad  
Love what you got, remember what you had  
Always forgive but never forget  
Learn from mistakes, but never regret  
I feel like it's coming it just ain't never done yet  
You wanna take off, go head rev up the jet  
Ain't gotta act like our paths should had never met  
Let's be happy apart instead of together upset  
I got the least out of something I put the most into  
It's fucked up when assholes are who we toasting to  
You remind me of somebody that I used to know  
Me and that other you, weren't introduced before  
And I don't like that bitch  
We go from belly  
I don't like that shit  
Who's gonna fill your space  
That's still a case  
Ben franks the only familiar face  
Get money  
  
[Hook]  
Oh yeah I think I remember you  
Yeah ahhh probably not  
You look so familiar too  
But you just wouldn't do this to me  
I know you just wouldn't do this to me  
Not you, I'm sorry I must have you confused  
Cause that can't be love  
You took advantage of a good thing  
And that ain't a good thing  
Take it how you want  
  
[Verse 3]  
I guess she forgot how I used to hold her  
The nights she was goin through it  
Crying on my shoulder  
And did a 360 it's like she got colder  
I'm starting to regret all the things that I showed her  
But I'm a rider  
She used to be my roller  
I guess the general just lost his best soldier  
I thought I felt some type of bond and got close to her  
She mean to me more  
Cuz ya boy a ghost to her  
  
[Hook]  
Oh yeah I think I remember you  
Yeah mmm ahhh probably not  
You look so familiar too  
But you just wouldn't do this to me  
I know you just wouldn't do this to me  
Not you, I'm sorry I must have you confused

"Same shit different day just riding through the city looking prettiest as
usual  
It's the same old thing got the name on the chain just to let them know who's
who  
And they know I've over here so they come and find me right after they lose
you  
For you niggas in the way we can let the guns say ""excuse you""  
At the end of the day we just trying find our way and I might be a come up  
And baby you hitch a ride but u gotta know how to do more than how to keep a
thump up  
It's so incredible that it ain't edible but they know the cake's real  
Yo I couldn't even say ask these other silicon niggas how being fake feel

Everyday is my day I'ma do it my way everyday  
Everything about me, what they love about me everything  
Everywhere that I be, feel VIP baby  
And everybody's cool, but y'all just ain't me  
  
Somebody better tell em that we in this bitch like an unborn baby  
See we be everywhere, and they ain't never there, couldn't tell you where they
be  
And you already know you ain't gotta ask me you can see that everything is up  
And I'm so bout my money you ain't talking about no money you ain't even gotta
bring it up  
And I hope you don't think me give a sugar honey iced tea or a middle finger
up  
I just stay sucker-free, leave the lames where they be, and I let my chips
pringle up  
Everybody calm down, there's enough to go around, you just gotta say how much
you want  
Don't know what you're looking for, unless it's a problem, I promise this
ain't what you want

Can you do me this favor, answer this question, y'all gon try who  
See the shoes by Gucci, bag by Louie, the hating'll be by you

"Yeah, everything, everything was the same  
  
I'm old enough to know better, young enough to not give a fuck

I gotta set it off, Jada Queen and Vivica  
The last chick was scared to get that money, I can't live like her  
Got no problem with you, niggas, get it how you live it, bro  
It's a cold world, these mean streets will shiver you  
All I asks is for the same respect that I be giving you  
If not my boy will put the beats on you, Karen Civil you  
That boy be on his shoot first, never mind the trivia  
My advice, don't mess with his man, word to Nivea  
We go back to when we got that white from Bolivia  
We was candy shopping before 50 and Olivia  
That's when you would go uptown 'cause you had to re' there  
Everybody broke back then, you had to repair  
Drug dealing was cool back then, you had to beware  
That was the 90's, y'all wouldn't get it, you had to be there  
That's why I'm glad to be here, some of us never made it  
It's hard to get off the ground, y'all think I just levitated  
Y'all think it was all love and nobody ever hated  
Y'all think 'cause I never stated I never been devastated  
All y'all see is sun shining, think I was never shaded  
Y'all think these calendar models is all that I ever dated  
Nigga, nothing was the same, HOT 97 played it  
Every day they made it that I stayed with 57 played it  
Can't trust nobody, the crib is heavy gated  
You ask why? I tell them even heaven's gated  
You know why? 'Cause when you good the devil hate it  
And even if you heavy weighted people want you feather weighted  
Attention, I never paid it, me and this clever lady  
She brains, do some things, then we lay together faded  
And while I chill, loaded up a steel  
Just wishing a nigga would but knowing a nigga will  
But for real, nigga, good is how you feel  
But soon as a nigga good is as soon as a nigga will  
Still, I don't owe these niggas nothing, put that in a nigga will  
  
Damned if you do them, if you don't, don't, don't, don't  
They don't have a hand on your head of what you're doing now  
You're damned if you do them, if you don't  
People sit around and judge you anyway  
Don't, don't, don't

"My youngins get it fucked up when y'all talk about the game  
Like it's designed in their favor  
Like it ain't outlined for them to waiver  
Their rights for a lil' bit of fame  
  
Get in bullshit fights for a lil' name  
To get noticed by some niggas that don't give two fucks about you  
Tell 'em you don't do the jives and shucks, and they route you to the shelf  
See there's no money in good health  
  
So they need you to be sick with it, ill content and delivery niggas  
This nation thrives off misery niggas  
So if you ain't trying to let your hard times increase your wealth  
Niggas keep that progressive shit to yourself  
  
This is the business of buying souls, and we only tryin' to fuck with those
who trying to sell them  
See, they may see me as an adversary 'cause they know I'm tryin' to tell them  
About the forest of artists who grow only to meet industry axes  
How they take niggas dreams and write then off in their taxes  
  
Contracts is confusing, but don't worry they'll appoint you a lawyer for you
whore you  
Loan you funds to fuck your soul make you pay it back and still maintain
control of your stroll  
Your tracks and your hot ass slow flow  
they'll keep you looking good and all that, but no dough  
  
You see when that get a bitch, they got a bitch  
And contrary to popular opinion it ain't my sistas that switch  
It's my brothers  
We the dumb motherfuckers  
  
Hardest niggas in the streets turned industry suckers  
'Cause we refused to do the knowledge  
Nigga, you can't learn this music game in the streets or in college  
So you betta pick up a book or something  
  
Or fuck it, FAB will put it in a hook or something  
Hope that you listen to it  
Got you pumpin' that poison while they paint them illusionary parades and keep
pissin' through it

And they can't afford chrome so they putting Vaseline on they hubs  
I'm looking for a girl with a ass like Trina to rub  
Take home and let her watch the plasma screen in the tub  
These niggas hate I'm moving so much cash and cream in the club

Everyday I'm switching the tags and pulling up sicker

Look at the blue flames that I'm in

Anywhere the kid move you know the hammers'll be with me  
Poking out the shirt like a Pamela Lee titty  
I went on tour brought the samples of D wit me  
Came back a month later bought a Lambo for three-fifty  
Think I throw you grams if you read with me  
Just because you see me on the camera with P. Diddy  
Dammit we P-driddy? Now I got G with me  
Along with the third leg that I be rammin in these bitties  
I keep the revolver you hope my gun'll jam  
But with the soap its gonna blam

Keep the rims in it, that spin in it for mine  
Can't see him in it, I been tinted up mine

Before the night is up,  
We can get right, we can get right)

"[Verse 1]  
I like 'em brown, yellow, Peurto Rican or Asian  
Who have the weekend occasion  
Sneak in the Days Inn  
I'm never tweaking of haze an frequently blazing  
Now if they ain't on ya face it ain't the cheeks that I stay in  
Can't deny it, used to take weeks and persuasion  
Now I just be looking down at these freaks in amazement  
With a girl, The first thing I peep a notice  
Is how full her lips is and deep her throat is  
So you ain't gotta be perfect  
I'll buy you whatever you want, But your heads gotta be worth it  
Still what I mean is  
Your brains gotta send chills through my penis  
Till I feel like a genius  
Look at it from a player's position  
I got a scholarship, I get smart without paying tuition  
My classes be like two three hours  
That's why I'm the smartest young guy since Doogie Howser  
  
[Chorus]  
Still what I mean is  
I really just want to get smart until I feel like a genius  
And all that I ask is  
That you help me get good grades in all of my classes  
Still what I mean is  
I really just want to get smart until I feel like a genius  
And all that I ask is  
That you help me get good grades, Ma in all of my classes  
  
[Verse 2]  
These bitches they done got real bad  
Cause now I pull out, Leaving 'em looking like model for a got milk ad  
I'm a teachers pet  
And even if you good at math ma  
You'll have trouble counting each baguette  
All it takes would hood tutors and some good Buddha  
And promise to buy them some of them Razor foot scooters  
They don't care where the cops is  
Outta the blue they stop biz  
Teacher started giving me a pop quiz  
I stay 10 minutes in night clubs  
Pocket full of green, Duke on it invented the night bulb  
I might pass on a female, And call up a substitute just for night  
Class in the CL  
Ya man don't know why his chicks knees be scared  
Can't tell her from giving my dick CPR  
If ya lift up and say ya jaws hurting, before squrting  
It's for certain  
You are the weakest link, Goodbye  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Verse 3]  
You know my girls in North and South Caddy  
They all for mouth waxing  
And the whores in Texas, Oral sexes  
I head to Cali, Take more blows to the head than Ali  
And the Philly mommy's suck the kid outta Willie Bonnie  
And the way females so Southern Hospitality in ATL  
Don't even know them hoes  
In South Beach, they let me jimmy dip in they mouthpiece  
Forget about Vegas, The head is outrageous  
The broads in Seattle will make ya knees rattle  
Fa shizzle da snizzle get smizzle down in VA  
Them hoes in Detroit will suck the whole revolt  
My dick don't get to die down when I'm in Chi-Town  
My bitches in be-More, Blow til they knees sore  
Good damn, there face I, ain't screwed down in St. Lou  
New York, It ain't got no pipe instructions  
They just suck outta you like liposuction

"From hood to hood they see what's hood  
And know who I be! uh!  
  
I got the Yankee leaning, just sitting over to browse  
And the G4 is just getting over the clouds  
You can't tell me that I ain't what's up right now  
I got a bottle of Tequila upside down  
There's some chicks wit boyfriends that are up tight now  
Cause they know the big 'dog' had a 'pups' like wow  
I'm stuck in my city ways  
Heading over seas wit a zip of New York City's haze  
You rats can keep running through your city's maze  
Until you get sprayed with the pesticide  
I know you in that hole, you best to hide  
Like the rest who tried, who went and testified  
Of course your girl wanna slide over and be rubbed  
And don't mind taking rides over the G dubs  
I ride Rovers on Spre-dubs  
Please don't be another dude who died over a ski dub, chill  
  
[Chorus:]  
From hood to hood they see what's hood and know who I be  
From block to block they see it, not can't know who I be  
From state to state they cannot hate, they know who I be  
From the east to west, through the Mid West and down south it's Ghetto!  
(It's Ghetto-oh!) It's Ghetto! (It's Ghetto-oh!) It's Ghetto!  
(It's Ghetto-oh!) It's Ghetto! (It's Ghetto-oh!) It's Ghetto!  
  
I get it jumping like a lo lo '64  
And bet they hop on it like a pogo stick pro  
I'm chilling wit these go go chicks though  
That do the kind of things that belong in a porno flick yo  
You know it's him and the gang  
With the bling worked on, that remind you of lemon meringue  
But remember the things, ain't too far  
And y'all wanna hear em go bang bang bang  
Like John Witherspoon, I'm watching em closely  
I know the snakes gonna slither soon  
The two toned Maybach's getting delivered soon  
The back feels like sitting in the living room  
I'm so hard bodied like the suit on Batman  
It's that man that back to back plat' scan  
I'm back for the third time, I make words rhyme for a living  
You probably heard I'm still ghetto, nigga!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
They tried to put two 9's on me, just like Gretzky  
But my lawyer saw through it just like wet tees  
I smoke till my eyes look just like Jet Li's  
On islands where the water's blue just like Pepsi  
Yeah the trigger just might get squeezed  
And the slugs will skip over your waves, just like jet skis  
Hoes know Ghetto from New York, call em the Fresh Prince  
And throw rose petals when I walk  
They love how I came back hard like good blow  
And I'm still a heart throb to a hood ho  
That's what hood though, yes I would know  
That's cause I'm in the streets like man hole covers  
Rims look like blades when a fan blow brother  
I'm waiting on a storm to land, roast others  
The man no other, cause I been in it  
My time is money, y'all couldn't buy ten minutes  
I'm gone! catch up!

Yo, Fabolous strive for digits, even connive to get it  
Niggas can't tell me nothin' dun, the 5 is kitted  
For Dead Presidents any cat alive can get it  
I walk around covered in ice like I survived a blizzard  
  
Got enough chips to bribe you wit' it  
Pay off security at clubs, get my guns and knives admitted  
I'm the type that gets tried and acquitted  
If my vibes ain't wit' it I pull the four five and spit it  
  
Then niggas run to the precinct and describe who did it  
Come home and find the necks on their wives are slitted  
I got niggas on my side committed  
To leave you and the driver splitted  
With your brain inside your fitted  
  
Fabolous, the only way to I.D. him is in a five BM  
Puffin' sticky green 'till my eyes be slim  
Operate with more chips than IBM  
Fuck with me, you make the news at five PM  
  
If ya'll see me gettin' locked it gotta be drugs  
If ya'll see chrome on the truck it gotta be dubs

If the bitch on her knees, it gotta be love  
If it's one thing it's gotta be, it's gotta be thug  
  
Niggas don't wanna play around, they see how calm I do things  
Swarm in a blue range, armed with two flames  
Flex play my joints, drop bombs like Hussein  
Catch a cataracts, glance at the charm and new chain  
  
I got coke in every part of Brooknam that you name  
Niggas want it, when you wave firearms their views change  
End up havin' to move they moms to Ukraine  
Get ADT alarms and new names  
  
What's come in the club, under each arm is two dames  
Buyin' bottles of Dom with his loose change  
Niggas hate me now 'cause I catch the eyes of dimes  
Flooded the hood with Tre's the size of dimes  
  
Ride through windows low, rims pokin' off the wheels  
I'm in the game tryin' to get broken off with Mils  
Shove the gun in your mouth, have you chokin' off the steel  
Niggas love the band, but the bitches open off the grill  
  
If ya'll see me gettin' locked it gotta be drugs  
If ya'll see chrome on the truck it gotta be dubs  
If I'm givin' somethin' to haters it gotta be slugs

Hop in the truck, ride up on ya'll like escalators  
Hit ya chest up, leave you hooked to respirators  
Bed ridden talkin' to investigators  
  
Now these ladies will do anything just to date us  
'Cause we skate around on ice like escapaders  
Dressed in Gators, in peace I'm restin' haters  
When police come for me, fly West to Vegas  
  
Ridin' or dyin', niggas know I'm ridin' with iron  
Smoke compartment in the dash that I'm hidin' the lye in  
My pockets is fat, ya'll accounts is on slim fast  
I'm twenty, with twenty's on a M-Class  
  
Just gimmie head it won't sweat your hairdo out  
We ain't tryin' to hear you out we tryin' to air you out  
Make ya'll run to the stores and clear Clue out  
'Bout to put cameras in the truck, take the rearviews out

It won't stop 'till my account is in the billions  
And I buy a home on the coast of Miami and the ammounts are in the millions  
Fish tanks and flat screens mounted in the ceilings  
Sippin' champagne I have trouble pronouncing while I'm chillin'  
Felt that you was squealin'  
You 'gon die even if Witness Protection put you in the mountains of New
Zealand  
Cause I hire bountys that be killin'  
That play Hide-And-Go Seek and find you after countin' to a million  
But a million records later  
Theres still some speculators  
Man these labels are giving the kid meals and checks like waiters  
When I come through you never see my heels be decked in gators  
And see Jordans that dropped when you was still a second grader  
Spill the Tec on haters  
I got a quick jab  
But when I squeeze these slugs'll hit you a milla second later  
I chill and check the waiter  
Dudes play gangsta for a minute but run to the cops squealing seconds later  
You still a Lexus trader  
My credit so good I drive off in the sc and tell the dealer ""Catch ya later""  
All I need is one night I don't deal with second daters  
Cause the white and gold stones on the grill and neck persuade her nigga

Started bringin' weight up while I starve  
Gained some cash and the ego now ya perpetrating like ya hard  
If you thinkin' you Pac I'm a wait in front of Quad  
Have my Kingston bullets through ya face like I'm Bernard  
Ya like beef but hate when I'm involved  
Cause I don't give ya a chance ta dodge bullets from the 8 when it revolve  
Niggas love when you broke but they hate when you get large  
Wait for you to slip and try to find a way to get you robbed  
Run in ya crib and duck tape you and ya broad  
And don't leave prints so jakes never get the case resolved  
So I play against the odds  
When its all set two niggas with two 40s a peice retaliatin' on ya squad  
If you get locked my Haitian'll leave you scarred  
Rape you in the yard  
With Gem Star blades cut ya face like a collage  
While I sip champagne in the Vegas lamatage'

And if you ask where I live they gon' give you

All that cops can suggest is that he sell  
How I'm goin' push it unless it's a v-12  
From S's to CL's, I request is  
In the head rests his TV's dwell  
They heard how many albums I presses for retail  
And they can't get a dime unless it's a weed sale  
And lets be real, catch me at the bar wit them crispy bills  
Getting Cris' re-fills, my wrist be chilled  
And my wardrobe look like I got an Ice Berg History deal  
Still dames have been giving me slow neck  
And I don't even know what they real names have been  
I feel ashamed to spend, cause when it comes to knocking 'em down  
I'm right behind Wilt Chamberlin

Ma you must of had too many weed totes  
Cause I ain't giving you any see-notes  
I'm all about floating on them new skinny speed boats  
Hundred and something with two skinny deep throats  
Winter hit, I'm in a new finny ski coat  
See the screens? ain't gotta use any remotes  
No more shopping sprees I'm rough wit the ends  
Keep honeys on their knees, scuffin' they shins  
I deal wit nothing but tens  
I be the club king wit diamonds shuffling your friends  
Chickens get keys, scuffing the Benz  
Cause they want to lock me down like I'm Puff in the pens  
Snatch any chink blond who feel my link long view  
(One try) I ain't trying to put clinks on you  
Hope tricking ain't one of the things you think John do

[Jo Jo Pellegrino]  
Well, say hello to the rap Al Capone, south with pone  
Tommy gun duck fitted to my mouth is chrome  
Don't get it backwards, Stuck Shore South is home  
Pelle who, soon to be caked out and blown  
Boss of the bosses, Pricehead, Soldier apparel  
Read the paper in my bed robe like Tony Soprano  
Throw em' all in the bottomless pit  
For rockin' bowling shoes, talk about rocks and shit  
[Cadillac Tah]  
Yo, you bitch niggas is prey, time pay  
I leave you shrumped in this five coupe [Errr]  
Faggot nigga I slide through  
Any hood representin' my set, generation is new  
But I wear this tech like a vest  
Spit and tear up ya vest  
D-A double D for that dough  
Hit em' where it hurt most  
You niggas ain't comin' close  
I run up, gun up, hit you and ya done up, playa you ghost  
We killers, Violator, Murderer niggas  
[Hook]  
[R.C.]  
It's the violator, clip changer, mix the mayor  
Got trick eight to throw more kisses than Jada  
And a bitch serve the guard properly  
She give me blows under the belt like a dirty boxer  
It's R. Cadillac's on twenty-twos  
And jewels that give you cataracts, bitch who you foolin'  
They gave me eight bars, no room to breathe  
And eight darts nigga, no one to leave  
[Fabolous]  
I come out with fire  
Stop, drop, roll out the booth  
Th rims come out the tires  
I stop, hop fall off the roof  
Only thing you should know is that's them hoin'  
This playa comin' back with the 4-5, like M. Jordan  
It's spelled with a capital F  
See everything from the sweater to the scarf to the capital F  
Now with the hoodrats, I'm like the rappin' Hugh hef  
Better known as F-A-be -O-L-O-you-S  
[Hook]  
[Fortune]  
It's time to separate the oil from the cut and gotten the pot  
So when the flame rise niggas gon' respect what's hot  
Four chain glock on em' with no warning  
Leave ya hood like a circle with no corners  
Made dough with the pot, heatin' and raisin'  
Been around more pies than sweet potatoes  
Violators, big dogs respect the line  
Niggas act, I'ma tear em' up in the club like Shyne  
[Remy Martin]  
why'all know if I spill sixteen it's a massive commodity  
[Machine Gun Firing]  
So I'ma just lay eight and etch the bodies  
Everybody knows who's the hottest bitch  
And that's why I'm the only bitch on this shit  
And any ho that chu' know love Rem and Nick  
Cause I spit as if I had a dick  
This rap shit I done mastered it, 8-ball assassin chick

Real Talk Of New York  
  
Its all eyes on me like Mr. Shakur  
So they wanna (pause) the door  
Chicks come around and put kisses on the jaw  
So I ain't a player that need assistance to score  
Any misses you saw  
Climb on the couch kicked off the Christian Dior  
I done popped 'till I sweat a Christ in a pore  
But I do it again if you missed it before  
Its no big deal  
I'm so big wheel  
In them little cars with those big wheels  
With a little box full of those big steels  
Pretty little chicks in those big heels  
For me it never gets old  
Most girls is diggers who ain't goin' never hit gold  
I get under the sun when the weather get cold  
8 ball five when the seven gets old  
  
Hey hey stop that mama  
Can't you see that I'm a East Coast stunna  
Hey hey you must misunder-stand

Hey hey hey hey

Now see you the type ta  
Get too hyper  
Maybe cause your chick like me  
But I'm a black card swiper  
That just pipe her  
And you don't give a like me  
They say I'm the sickest since Carter dropped  
So girls jump to it with Vince Carters hops  
Its the truck with the twenty inch startin' stops  
That have 'em not knowin'  
Whether they stayin' or goin'  
They stare at the Airs and be sayin' it glowin'  
And they like my style and the way I be flowin'  
But that's when I bud in and say that I'm blowin'  
Now you could make the choice if you stayin' or goin'  
Girl  
We could go any place in the world  
And the jet hold twelve so theres space for ya girls  
Nobody in the street gonna hear  
That you givin' forty thousand feet in the air

Hey hey hey hey  
No need for conversation  
  
Most of these tag a longs  
Brag on songs  
But can't keep it up like a Baget thong  
Keep frontin' like you spend  
While ya pockets get lighter and lighter like Michael's skin  
On the other hand  
I'm the kind of brother man  
With fifty thou of ice just up on the hand  
Bentley bright and rocky covered band  
And a zone that'll tell the time in another land  
Girls spread they legs same day I bagged 'em  
Its the Mustard Gut, Mayo Magnum  
In the twenty twos with the butter knife shine  
That's why every body and they mother like mine  
I rarely be  
Where the willies be  
There ain't been a dude this smooth since Billy D  
Girl you need to make your move  
The ego is what (pause) the Lakers groove

Niggaz ain't gon' be happy till I click on a rage  
Pick up a gauge, and it's my face, that they stick on front page  
Gotta be careful, I could pull a thick of the age  
Chick on the stage, and winde up, sick in a cage  
  
When I come through, it's usually in Dickies that's beige  
Pushing a ""Eleanor"", like I'm Nicholas Cage  
And it's funny how a few bucks can  
Get you put under a white sheet, like you in the Ku Klux Klan  
  
It's Street Fam' for life, we ride to the death  
We play hard dog, don't cry to the rest  
I don't know you, please move to the left  
Or stay here and get introduced to the tefs  
  
I'm riding till the wheels come off it (yeah)  
Grindin till a mil' come off it (yeah)

Now when I spray wit the sauer, I gotta spend a day wit the lawyer  
Worryin bout, who say that saw ya  
Keep yay wit the oyers, two kids on the block  
Like when Mourning and Mutumbo, used to play wit the Hoyas  
  
I'ma boss, that you can never upstand  
Or get a red dot on you, like a 7Up can  
Some of why'all caught feelings from way back  
Others waited till I came through, short willing the Maybach  
  
But I'm still bucking like, five, duce, four, trey  
Still tucking and letting the fo' spray  
Still ducking where ever the po's lay  
And still fucking, and making them hoes say, WHOA!  
  
...And I know Fed's seen  
The old school Chevy, with the dope head lean  
why'all love the way I are-I-D-E  
Call my D.E., and put you on a R.I.P.T., ghetto

"Uh, they call me G H E T T O, nigga  
Uh, uh, I'm back on that bullshit

I bet you look at things from a different perspective  
When you see the size of the slugs, the fifth or the tech get  
A couple'll lift a detective and make sure the legs  
That he used to walked with is defective  
All you niggas do is sit on blocks and jive  
About who's the baddest bitch and if Pac's alive  
Nigga, I'm in a aqua five with a button  
That make the roof flip back like pocket knives  
I can't knock ya drive, you feelin' like Rocky  
Till you get a beatin' like he got in Rocky 5  
The squad'll still hold toast and get these bitches  
To open they legs wider than a field goal post  
Broke niggas don't wanna stand my grind so they knock it  
Think my jeans got Mickey D's signs on my pockets  
The hydro combined with the chocolate have ya eyes  
Lookin' like the tall dude who signed with the Rockets  
The flow is so sick, sooner or later  
These niggas gonna need barf bags bigger than golf bags  
The coke get flew on planes monthly and cops search me  
For weapons harder than they do in Hussein country  
And any chick that get a view of the chain wit me  
I guess that's what Jay meant by chain reactions  
Bitch, it's nothin' to thumb off some notes  
Fuck a dealer, I get 'em when they come off the boat, fucka  
Yeah, ghetto, Fab, nigga, uh, uh, Street Family

"It's easy to look at my life and don't see no pain  
I remember takin 3, 4 trains to re cocaine  
Standing in the lobby during sleet, snow, rain  
Waiting for fiends with a pint of beef lomain  
  
Breaking day on the grind, I used to be so drained  
But ain't a Saturday I wasn't up to see Soul Train  
Sometimes I ain't see no gain  
'Cause I was runnin to Ralphies everytime my trees showed stains  
  
I was lucky I ain't seized or maim  
Get shot or stuck up standin at them see-Lo games  
But now shit with these skios changed  
I ain't know why the fuck they used to look at me so strange  
  
Glanced at my neck and didn't see no chain  
Be saying ""That's nasty"", wouldn't give me no brain  
Ya'll surprised F-A-be -O's sane  
In my rolla life, I done jumped in and out of 3, 4 lanes  
I'm still here  
  
[Chorus]  
My momma used to tell me  
""Son, you're gonna make it one day, it'll happen""  
Who knew I'd have what it takes,  
To be famous and one day I'd be rappin - no  
My papa used to ask me ""Son, are you prepared?  
'Cause one day it could happen""  
I dreamed about this game,  
But who would of believed that one day I'd be trapped in - no  
  
I just want some peace of mind  
Nigga's will risk havin cuffs on their wrists for this masterpiece on mine  
Know that I'm a squeeze until the top of my piece recline  
I can't see myself in back of a Caprice confined  
  
But on a small island, too far for police to find  
With girls who look 'Rican and Guyanese combined  
I gotta make sure my niece is fine  
She get every doll for Christmas, new Jordans at Easter-Time  
  
Some be like ""At least you signed""  
But that just make is easy to get pointed out at precinct lines  
All ya'll can see if every piece be dime  
And I be gettin Nikes before they even get released sometime  
  
Youngsters, don't let these videos geese your mind  
It ain't cool to end up deceased for shine  
And if you can't get the whole pot, just take a piece and grind  
Hold your head, your stress will cease in time  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Sometimes I wish I could go way back when  
I could walk through and ain't nobody know Jay Jackson  
Everything was OK back then  
Now everybody playin a cool role and I know they actin  
  
I gotta go back through my ol' way packin  
These wolves know my jewels is filled with O shade Jacksons  
I don't care as long as my dough stay stackin  
But these niggas with me be eager to show they Mack 10s  
  
And I'm the one the PO's stay trackin  
Plus I got all these ducks around the ol' way quackin  
These hoes may crack grins  
But I swear to God I won't never take O.J's actions  
  
If I would've let this flow stay packed in  
I'd probably be with Nick and 'Rome, spending my whole day shacked in  
For now I just roll on those eight Jacksons till Clue and Duro brings those  
Gray plaques in  
Yeah

One day it'll happen  
That One day I'd be rappin  
No  
One day it could happen  
One day I'd be trapped in

Yo everything ain't love, love cause if it is  
My definition of love must differ his  
I mean every friendship has its differences  
But these 'Young Bucks' remind me of 'Fif' and his  
They hear the good life, wanna see what the difference is  
Some just wanna smoke, enjoy the piff-vileges  
He unwrap a cigar like it's a gift of his  
He a funny lil nigga like Eddie Griffin is  
Between smokin' and chokin' then you got to live  
So I gave him a chance and that's a lot to give  
We 'posed to make the most of what you was paid to gross  
I gave you bread and butter you supposed to make the toast  
Fifteen years, fifteen years  
And now when we say 'what's up' the shit seem weird  
But there's a question I prepared for you  
How could you fuck the only people who ever cared for you?  
A thug changes

There's a parallel path 'tween friends and enemies  
And whenever you cross it you make friend-emies  
There's no remedies for these sick memories  
My doctor said there's no cure for the Emmales  
Had a crush on you now we Kim and Cease  
We don't even talk no more it's no biggie  
I was so Biggie, you was Faith  
I let you slide in my home, you was safe  
I thought my ability to provide you stability  
Was what was really G, okay silly me  
I was Billy D, smooth cappa really street  
Really she attract niggaz like the a Milli beat  
And I happen to rap but somethin' 'bout this beat strange  
Soon as I try to flow with it the beat change  
Never thought she'd change  
But what you thinks a upgrade really just could be a seat change

Just niggas with chains on tryna be S.F. (Street Fam)  
That's when your ace become ya B.F.F.  
Pa-Pa-Pa-Pachange ya like they was a P.F. chef  
Da-Da-Da-Danger, it just feels 'Mystikal'  
I miss the cool nights sittin in the Coll-O  
Now it's like boo we sittin' in Apollo  
It used to be all good then shit just went mile low  
And that's bad, matter fact that's sad  
Cause when you lose a friend it's hard to handle the loss  
They do some bitch shit gotta give ya man a divorce  
End up watchin' Friends like Joey, Chandler and Ross, ya see  
Most of these niggas ain't never love 'em

I'm old enough to know better, young enough to not give a f-ck  
Rather hold my high and die then live and duck  
If you're cool being taken down and giving up  
Your lifestyle's a blow job, the way you're living sucks!  
I done felt pain, waited but no help came  
Went through some crazy shit still kept myself sane  
You ever been dying of thirst and smelt rain  
Ever been told ""go to hell"" and felt flames  
The water's to your neck and only gets deeper  
It's all down hill and it only gets steeper  
Gotta get over it, be a hurdle leaper  
  
It cost to be the boss, it aint get no cheaper  
But there's a man above that we all under bro  
No bread truck but he work wonders though!  
After you wake up, everything is wonderful  
You can overcome anything you undergo  
As an artist I'm just tryna paint the perfect picture  
But see where tryna wait for somebody that's perfect gets you  
That usually lead to nothing like virgin kisses  
And I be tryna cut, surgeon bitches  
Dreams of splurging riches, pretty but curvy misses  
Chef to serve the dishes, driving to swerve the ditches  
I'm just another kid on the purple wishes?  
And the streets is tough, on the verge of viscious  
So I sold weed and crack, business  
That white girl helped a nigga, Fergalicious  
But getting money bring jealousy and verbal disses  
So when you killin' shit watch out for the murder witness  
An old head told me, let nothing disturb your business  
Beef is only good when you in the burger business  
So I chilled, but loaded up the steal  
Like I wish a nigga would, But I know a nigga will  
But for real you loaded up to kill  
Cause soon as a nigga could the sooner a nigga will  
And I don't owe these niggas nothing  
Put that in a nigga will

Invisible set glow  
Full clip to let go  
Back in the metro  
Fresh off the jet though  
Fifty grand richer from a thirty minute set show  
Gangsta but i'm the flyest you ever met ho  
Button up etro  
The Air Jordan Retro  
Million dollar neck row  
Got homie upset so  
Now I get the bank and make them petty dudes bet mo'  
Told you from the get go  
Ya'll can't deny it  
I just supply it  
For those who buy it  
Now I ride by it  
It might start a riot  
Chicks won't quiet  
Long enough to try it  
Dirt they throwin' mud slides on my name  
They never seen this kind of stud size in a chain  
I analyze that like i'm Billy Crystal  
I'm forced to move around with this nine milly pistol

She ready, so I'm ready  
I feel it comin' on strong, you're so heavy  
She ready, I'm ready  
  
I hear if you stay ready, you ain't gotta get ready  
Call you when I get there, you just get your shit wetty  
Oops I mean your shit ready, can't believe I said that  
Least you know where my head at, now shorty where your head at  
She gon' dive in head first, school me like the board of ed  
She do it then we do it so she can say she thought ahead  
Laid up in that all day, can't get out that waterbed  
Talk nasty for ya boy, silent treatment for the feds  
No cup for the thirsty, she bad as controversy  
Skin-tone like Hershey, body Lord have mercy  
Yeah if this thing were a car, it'd be a Lamborghini Mercy  
Maybe I'm too fast, girl say she  
  
And baby we don't need a bed, no

She ready, I'm ready  
  
Talkin' 'bout you born ready, talkin' 'bout it's on deck  
Talk a good one on text, you say you 'bout it I'm gon' check  
I put some kisses on neck, let me warm that engine up  
Relax when the tension's up, girl you just call your nigga up  
And I pop up in that all black and kill that  
See I'm dressed appropriate, you got to feel that  
Feel that? (I feel that)  
That's that love comin' down  
For the brain, I'm dumbin' down, we on swole when she come around  
Need ice to numb it down, night stick to beat it up  
Rodney King that teen girl, can't we all just get along?  
You could get along, you already know, but is you ready though?  
  
And baby we don't need a bed, no  
Don't need a master room, don't need to set the mood  
She like, ""Yeah, yeah""

She ready, so I'm ready  
I feel it comin' on strong, you're so heavy  
She ready, I'm ready  
  
If you are a bad one, be ready (Be ready)  
Two times for my niggas, we ready (We so ready)  
Pretty ladies in the V.I. and they ready (They so ready)  
I'm feelin' good, chillin' good, I'm ready (I'm ready, yo)  
Left a girl in the back, she ready (She so ready)  
We don't know how to act, we ready (Cause we're ready)  
And we can't wait to get home (If you're ready, come on)

"Uh, you think I give a fuck about  
What these niggas say man  
They even talked about Jesus  
I ain't mad at when it rain, 'cause I know the sun is somewhere shinin'  
Sorta like some clear diamonds  
I hardly see my moms, but she know her son is somewhere grindin'  
Some where rhymin', or somewhere climbin'  
Out of a pottable 760, inclasable very sticky  
Wit a handgun, to send these cowards to Heaven quickly  
I ain't pussy, so I won't allow you to ever dick me  
I know these grease balls, wonder how could they ever stick me  
But I move, like the President through town  
Wit stones the size of earrings, in my Presidential crown  
I put hollows from the Desert into clowns, 'cause the cometary  
Is where most of the dudes, that are hesitant are found  
So I take the time, of whatever the bench throws  
The 4BM put down, in a seventy-two inch hole  
Mean while getting adapted, to the fame has be hectic  
But I'm fucking like I'm tryna take down Chamberlain's record  
And the girls more than like you, when you running around  
Doing world tours like Michael, but girl's sure don't like you  
You going on like thirty-six, flowin' on some berry mix  
The little money you get, you blowing on them dirty chicks  
Tryna look young, so you throwing on the jersey quick  
I'm on my second V-12, you going on ya thirty-six  
You can look at this rider, and see I'm on the come-up  
'Cause I pass the hitch-hikers, like I don't see 'em with they thumb up  
I just turn the system up and keep boppin'  
I never get, where I'm tryna go, if a nigga keep stoppin'  
And I tell the cops, this joint is for protection  
Don't they see when I come through  
How these people point in my direction  
That's why I poke out my jeans  
Like my joint with a erection  
Till I'm in a joint made for correction  
And right now, the way rapper bi'ness spread  
It wouldn't even surprise me  
If one of these rappers is a Fed, nigga  
Since I'm in the position to get rich, I'ma get it  
Whether it come from rapping on blocks, flippin' and pitchin'  
And fuck the stove, and the kitchen where I cook and prepare it  
Nigga you know and don't try to act like the truth ain't apparent  
I'm on a mission to get richer, it's as simple as that  
I make it obvious, when I pick up a pencil and rap  
Like a .40 Cal, spittin' on instrumentals I clap  
And these verses, are like the hollow point I sent through yo back  
I get you murdered if I think you a rat  
'Cause if you don't show loyalty  
Then that show me where ya principles at  
And you don't know how much I been through, in fact  
I never did like you, I ain't even gon' pretend wit you cats  
And I'm the nicest, I ain't gotta say it twice and repeat it  
I'm a lyrical genius, I never been beated, defeated  
I'ma draw my weapon and squeeze it, you better believe it  
Leave you parapaligic, I demand respect and I mean it  
My Desert's the meanest, you probably dead if you seen it  
Or spored out somewhere sick, you get red on the cement  
And I blow off ya head for no reason and just when I'm leavin'  
You don't know me ya owe me homie  
But the spread make us even, blow  
And the bad part about it is man  
I'm only twenty years old man  
And I'm just havin' fun  
Man I ain't even tryin' man  
Desert Storm's youngest and in charge man  
Paul Cain, man  
Yo Fab man, you ain't even gotta go hard man  
I got these niggas man  
Clue, holla at cha boy, Skatin' Dolla  
Duro, it's our year man  
Desert Storm, we gon' kill niggas man  
You already know what it is it's a ho'cide man  
Stop, ""Street Dreamin""  

"
"Yea, I ain't scared of you motherfuckers  
I ain't no killer right  
But y'all niggas gon' make me one  
For real, leave me alone, shit  
You fucking with the wrong one brother  
I'm telling ya  
  
I'm sitting in the crib dreaming about killing ya  
With machine guns shotties and desert E dilligers  
Putting a bullet as big as a battery through a niggas anatomy  
And watching him die slow  
You need full clips to push up in the joint  
When you in the kinda truck that I push up to the joint  
'cause theses motherfuckers will push him to the point  
That you'll end up locked down doing push ups in the joint  
But they'll box you in the corner  
And you can throw ya fists up and act like you a boxer on his corner  
Ride wit ya gun in your glove box instead of on ya  
You'll be six feet deep in one of them boxes if you want to  
Not me, I squeeze the clips drop from the handle  
Till your remains is in a urn on top of the mantle  
Till everybody scramble off the block like they Randall (run)  
Till there's a murial on your block and some candles  
Who want to die?  
  
[Chorus:]  
I don't want to kill no one but I ain't no motherfuckin' punk  
I don't want to kill no one but I ain't no motherfuckin' chump  
I don't want to kill no one but I ain't no motherfuckin' clown  
'cause I'ma have to kill someone just to get some respect  
  
My Teflons will have you screaming like Wyclef Jean (someone please call
9-1-1)  
But if they ever get the watch on my left arm  
I'ma have more bury than that guy Stephon  
First they put that white seed over you brother  
Then the newspapers put you all over the cover  
Then you in a suit one hand cross over the other  
Next you in the earth with the dirt over you brother  
A tinted hearse is what most men leave in  
Followed by a limo full of family and close friends greaving  
When you pull the marijuana  
I'ma want to kill you as bad as The Terminator wanted Sarah Connor  
But I'm loosing my patience  
Fuck it send me to the island I could use a vacation  
Now it's easy for me to understand  
How you could just kill a man  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'd rather be judged by twelve  
Than carried by the six  
My gun ain't on my man, or carried by my chicks  
My gun ain't in my crib or carried in the six  
If I'm right here nigga, then this right here nigga  
Picture me putting my hearse  
Like I ain't gotta a clip full a hollow tips to put in these jerks  
I might as well put in the work  
Spit em up outta here and get em up outta here  
I got the juice like bishop had wit him  
That just don't give a fuck, semi  
Like ol' dog had wit him  
I'm saying prayers for my enemy  
I hope god bless him before the fucker run into me  
I dunno, what the fuck has got into me  
But I know I don't want them slugs going into me  
I'm just trying to live my life  
So niggas better give me my respect or give me life  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Look what you made me do man  
Look what you made me do man  
I didn't want it to come to the right  
But fuck it,  
Niggas will push you to that point man  
Niggas will play with you so much man  
Aggravate you so much man  
That you want to kill a nigga man  
Yea

Every month I ain't gotta give more doe up  
Fuckin' with this you'll buy a washer when the shore slow up  
I have it when ya kids see-saw go up

Check these diamonds, no flaws show up  
My niggas clap up parties, shoot tour shows up  
What y'all know bout head till a chicks jaw swoll up  
Goin' gold minutes after the gates on stores go up  
You know who done it now, few hundred miles  
And with shoes on it now

When we run up this guns to stomach style  
Got to flaunt it now

Yo, you must wanna die  
From the nigga you testify against  
Fabolous make bail before they identify the prints  
Swing by a Vince, in a buggy eye with tents  
Sitting on nineteen's, gun stash by the vents  
Niggas is looking at the chain cause they eyes squint  
I pull up, pull out, pull back  
Them guys will sprint  
Last nigga that talked slick and been replyin' since  
Got a deal, no sellin', been supplyin' since  
Leave niggas on the ground like tire prints  
We done make ya eyes look bent, just by the sense  
These niggas don't believe, then they gone die convinced  
Once I present the four fifth why comment  
I'm the type you tell ya dame bout  
Push a fellow brain out  
Leave'em in front of the spot that they sell cocaine out  
One single, had to tint the yellow range out

Miss you so  
  
My daddy left me, and he ain't even die  
So when he did go, I ain't even cry  
I had reason, but that ain't even why  
How could he have failed if he ain't even try  
I ask no questions, I ain't even pry  
Truthfully I wanted to I can't even lie  
Like a canceled flight, that ain't even fly  
To just walk away, like you ain't even my  
Like, like, like I ain't even your  
I cant even say it, I ain't even sure  
He shoulda gave me everything and left me even more  
But he left me without saying what he was leavin' for  
And that's when I became a man  
And that's the day he stopped bein' one  
This year I became a father  
And I'm a die bein' one, whats up son  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I have nightmares of me not bein' round  
He took his first steps and daddy couldn't be in town  
Daddy's entertaining everybody  
But missed out when it came to trainin' for the potty  
I give a fuck about hip-hops new beef  
I was more excited when my son grew teeth  
So I same the problem  
Of the famous stardom  
Just like Em and Haily  
Just like Game and Harlem  
Weezy's at the awards with Miss. Carter  
Nah not his date, i'm talkin' bout his daughter  
Now that's stuntin' like your daddy  
Cause its crazy when you wanna be nothin' like your daddy  
And if you never been a man  
That's the day you start bein' one  
This year I became a father  
And I'm a die bein' one, whats up son  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So hear the truth remain to let me go  
I wont hold that against you, I moved on  
Just look what I become since you been gone  
Now don't you turn away, oh, please don't go  
Here's what I got to say, oh  
Please don't go  
oh why'd you go away, oh  
Please don't go  
I needed you here to stay, oh  
Please don't go  
I cant believe this day, oh  
Please don't go

Why did you leave me?  
Tell me why you don't care

[Verse 2]  
Bitches think all they gotta do is say the child is yours  
Quit they job and live off the child support  
How could you stand there, smile in court  
I'm a just settle, fly back to them Cayman Isle resorts  
  
You better sign a pre-nup  
You catch me instead of 'it wasn't me'  
I'm gonna say 'where you get a key from?'  
I love the way your butt swishes  
  
But non of these slut bitches  
is worth me asking my doctor why my nuts itches  
If they see how the Rolls Royce smell  
All day I be emptying my in box and my whole voice mail  
  
I'll be ready to light the weed and pull it  
Now every chick want to make me come faster than a speeding bullet  
But I ain't into coaching birds like Tony LaRussa  
I done had the thickest chickens to the boniest roosters  
  
Who have trouble getting the kid like me to spend  
Ma you'll never see a bad guy like me again, for real  
  
[Pain In Da Ass]  
So say goodnight to the bad guy, come on  
It's the last time you're gonna hear a bad guy ???  
You better make way, it's a bad guy coming through  
  
[Verse 3]  
Come on  
What type of bad guy give fellas ???, females hugs  
I making my business, my kids won't have to retail drugs  
I get threats over the two way from email thugs  
  
I ride with ratchets, clips under the CL rugs  
Think I'm liking you? Wrong  
'Cause even if I get locked  
My money won't let me stay unrighteous for wrong  
  
Case dismissed, the DA even liking the song  
Right back to the P's, latest pair of Michael's shoes on  
When you holla in the club it's cool  
But don't change the subject fool  
  
And start askin if I remember you from public school  
You know I done heard dozens, of these birds buzzing  
Talking 'bout I used to fuck with they 3rd cousin  
FYI, stay the fuck from 'round me  
  
[unknown] guys who want to hear somebody stuck or clown me  
I don't care what other haters do  
But if you think I'm loved for saving you  
Say goodnight to the bad guy

Who wanna bet us that they can't fuck wit us?  
Stack cheddar forever, live treacherous, solely etceteras  
Til the death of us, me and my confidents  
We shine, we make the ambiance, you niggas just rhyme  
  
You lil niggas need guidance, you barkin up the wrong trees  
Pissin on the wrong hydrants, I'm a high fence  
I grew up round violence, you grew up playin violins  
In yo hood silence, where I'm from silence  
  
[Verse:]  
They just killed this vibe, they just killed this vibe  
There's something bout killing shit that makes us feel alive  
We feed off yo energy, we see you on that Kenny G  
Just do in yo own harm, do yo thing my nig  
Whenever you will not keep to that mighty nyc  
We gon check that name you claim  
Bring yo job and id  
We take it the wrong way, all gold everything  
One gold watch, two gold chains, give me all those, everything  
Yall don't wanna pump heads, ocho, Evelyn  
Them boys will leave you butt naked  
And the mall closed and everything  
The streets is watchin aksin if you gon reply to them  
Seem like yall woke up sleeping giants, Eli and Em

A major comeback but from a minor setback  
But still they know we livin, was thinkin bout to get back  
The get back, the get back, the get back, the get back  
The get back, the get back, the get back, the get back  
I crack a smile knowing God has a day for me  
Until that day comes I slay these niggas faithfully

I'm like Nino with the uzzi back of the motorcycle head  
Until you're back at them Italians who killed Keisha at the wedding  
I'm like dope boy lookin for Ricky's killer  
One last soldier, niggas who turn they backs on me  
Turn yo punk ass over  
Yall smoke my smoked my cousin Harold  
Now I'm in a Camaro  
Love and happiness playing, me and my dog with a double barrel  
38, 40 belows, live or die motherfucker  
I'm Pac, ride or miss, riverside motherfucker  
Get back, everybody better get back  
To my niggas in the jet black  
For the seats let back on yo jet back  
If you're a gambling man you could bet that  
It's a sure thing, not just a New York thing  
A rich or a poor thing  
It's a lace yo boots, pull yo draw string, who wanna go to war thing?  
It's a who gon protect your thing?  
Who really wanted morphine?  
Put legends in coffins  
It's a bullet holes in the door thing  
It's a nobody, sure things  
Street cold, not a Lord thing  
It's kids that wasn't taught things, old ladies like poor thing  
Poor thing, to get back is important  
Poor thing, for the dead homies we pour pain  
Like what you sayin while it's cocked back to em  
Guess what goes around comes around, got back to em

Hey-hey-hey yo [Repeat: x2]

Ain't no tellin' what this hip lowered do to me  
I'm feelin' like I can do what I want now  
Dip-low immunity  
Shorty! just shake your hips slow and move wit me  
Take a hit a this and sip slow and thoroughly  
You're sneakin' out on your man, tip-toein' to the V  
Cause I know you got him whipped though like wannabe  
Let's put on a live strip show just you and me  
But girl, I'm lookin' at them lips though like who is he?  
They ain't never seen a whip, clothes or jewelry  
So when I ask ""you want to leave the zip-code?""  
Say ""sure"" and be me  
  
[Chorus 1: Fabolous]  
But this is my party  
Stroll by if you want to  
Or y'all can stay home  
But why would you want to?  
  
[Fabolous]  
We gon' party, till we laid in graves  
Sweat out our doobie braids and waves  
Then scream ""hey-hey-hey yo""  
That groupie made her wait  
Cause when she seen the whips and chains  
She started talking 'bout she ready to be made a slave, c'mon  
  
[Chorus 2: x2]  
This is my party  
So get fly if you want to  
Get high if you want to cause I know you want to  
Put your hands up as high as you want to  
And if it feels good scream ""hey-hey-hey yo""  
  
[Fabolous]  
I don't know about y'all  
But we doin' it over here  
All the glasses got liquid that brewin' it over here  
Cigars got somethin' sticky that's glueing it over here  
Ladies movin' it over there, movin' it over here  
I can fit a few in a Rover's rear  
We havin' a good time, don't ruin it overs this  
You see why we asks is to see ID  
Cause girls will do anything for some VIP access  
Me I relax this (easy)  
Cause I'm used to ballin'  
You could tell that these guys need practice  
But if it was a problem then I would confront you  
You saying ""over"" bet ya I say ""you want to""  
But a pitcher that probably slugs, pitches and talk a put  
I ride wit the top down and switch to the top-up look  
Would you believe most these bitches go bop up shook  
Their asses pokin' out like them pictures in pop up books  
  
[Chorus 2]  
  
[Fabolous]  
Oh yea! We's off the Richter Scale  
Hate will get you, put in coffins quick as hell  
If the ladies would show it off and thick as hell  
For my hustlers knockin' off them bricks as well  
And everybody, up north that's sick in jail  
I probably feel y'all, send you all of the flicks in mail  
The Street Family speed off six SL's  
To all them chicks at Yale ""hey-hey-hey-hey yo""  
Shake your glasses back and forth to mix it well  
Shake your ass back and forth as quick as hell  
And just from lookin' at them thighs from the front view  
Girl I know that these guys say they want you  
If I wake up in the sand, clothes from yesterday  
Same hoes from yesterday  
Lightin' clips to the same dro' from yesterday  
Her hang-overs yesterday  
You ain't mistaken we in Benz's today  
But we had them Range Rovers yesterday

Cause you cant  
I stay way ahead of the game  
Ya know, catch me if you can nigga  
  
Throwback this, throwback that  
It ain't where you from its where you wear ya throwback at  
I rock the reds pete rose when I'm in the 'natti  
And [repeat: x4]  
You cant see the semi-automatti  
When I'm in the chi' you think they ain't that shocked  
To see the kid roll through in the st. pats socks  
So pull out the Chicago and the script to wear on soul train  
The bulls, when mike had hair and a gold chain  
I get the spirit in St. Louis, how could the god lose  
I do back flips in the ozzie cardinals  
They love me in Cleveland, every time I travel there  
I'm in the Indians or that cavaliers  
When I hit Minnesota, that kid from brooklyn wear  
The vikings or the Timberwolves from Garnett's rookie year  
And in Milwaukee I had to pimp it and go back  
20 years with the bucks and brewers throw backs  
  
[Chorus:]  
Throwback this, throwback that  
They even look better with the matching hat  
All you gotta check is the players stats  
It ain't where you from its where you wear ya throwback at  
Throwback this, throwback that  
They even look better with the matching hat  
All you gotta check is the players stats  
It ain't where you from its where you wear ya throwback at  
  
I might charge through San Diego with the bolts on my shoulder  
Rock the trailblazer warm-up, cause Portland gets colder  
And even the pimps be jealous  
When I'm in the floor seat at the forum in the m.p.l.s.  
And they be askin' what teams on the kid chest  
This the rams before they moved to the midwest  
When I'm in the bay with it, I don't play with it  
I'm in the athletics with the matchin' A's fitted  
This ain't even for the minors  
Cause they don't know nothin' bout the Joe Montana, 49ers  
Seattle, probably heard different rumors  
Either about the Payton or the Griffey Jr.  
I come through Denver like 4th quarter with Elway  
Or the nuggets that make them yell  
In phoenix I do the old suns  
Cause the new jerseys is cool, but nothings really like the old ones  
Ya know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
In new york what I wear the the club may vary  
Mets or Yankees like the subway series  
When I'm in Boston I melt the bean  
In a hot red Soxs or Celtics green  
In the city of Philly, I roll up on the biddes like feel these  
In a size 56 Phillies  
In jersey I got the nets on  
That you can bet on  
In d.c. I couldn't pull it  
Without the bullets  
When I stop in Atlanta I cant talk long  
Them birds know I got the falcons or the hawks on  
That peach Tampa bay don't hit the streets too often  
Not even Miami could take the heat of dolphins  
Ain't no complaints on  
When I'm in New Orleans with the saints on  
In Houston I pass hoes  
In the Astros  
In Dallas I always gotta have  
The cowboys or the mavs  
? to keep it coming, and I'ma keep it coming

Paper or plastic, its safer to ask it

I popped enough alcohol so we all could swig it  
Guns, stand them up they be as tall as midgets  
O.k, I'll rap a little faster  
But do I really sound like I turned from a rapper to a pastor  
I'm like you except I date supermodels  
The cars that I drive, the state troopers follow  
We get the same parties probably  
My stones look like sunshine, yours probably cloudy

Get head while I'll roast in a sauna

You wanna end up on the ern on the mantle nigga, yea

I look at these brothers and laugh  
Jealous niggas dont hate havin', just others that have  
I still got love for the av.,  
Come through to give ya niggas girls baby mothers my math  
I speak on others behalf, only hate makin' money  
And gotta give the government half  
You know this brother live last  
And not even Mike seen Jordan's in the colors I have  
I used to run from under covers like Shaft  
That was until this young playa got shoved into the draft  
Now I'm covered in ice, like Bruce Lee's body  
Niggas is scared, to lose these hotties

Now the family get money like Will and them  
Accounts rise like we filling them with helium  
My baby girl got ass, it's no secret that it  
Make you look away and still be peeking at it  
She said they come with painted faces trying to clown on you  
How they under you but try to talk down on you  
You see, a rat is gonna be that and go for any cheddar

Just lookin at your onion girl I could cry, and I could lie

And make you scream out (baby)..just like I put you on the track  
  
Then I'ma lay you on your side  
And slowly stroke you while you telling me the way you feel inside  
But my sex drive won't make me play you on the side  
You know you get the keys any day you wanna ride  
And my baby know how to start me up  
You got the kind of kiss that'll speed a heartbeat up  
And you got the kind of touch that'll gimme the chills

'cause now I ain't wit cha, know that I miss ya, some how I carry on  
I can still picture, when I was wit cha like you was never gone  
I remember the good times, all of the bad times  
I dedicate this song, to my niggas laid out, til my niggas lay down  
Can Ya Hear Me, I know you hear me  
  
[Fabolous]  
Now we was once two niggas of the same kind  
Quick to holla at a bitch with the same lines  
Quick to draw on a nigga with the same nines  
But at the same time we was on some different shit  
'cause you was with a bitch that I beg to differ wit  
I told you sniff a bit and you could get a whif of it  
But you kept a closed nose when it came to those hoes  
And I'm your nigga so I tried to smell em wrong for ya  
Wasn't there to take the fault for ya, But if you hear me  
I dedicate this song for ya, He was setup in a stick up  
By a girl he used to pick up on the upper west side  
I used to help him chop a brick up, They found him in his pickup  
Pants down and dick up, leaning with one in his head  
And one in his chest, One of the best at this husslin' shit  
But his downfall was that he put his trust in a bitch and it's fucked up  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Fabolous]  
I remember selling three bricks of raw powder  
Turn my man into a star in 24 hours  
He didn't care spent the money in like 4 hours  
On a Benz with like 400 and Horsepower  
And a chain that had christ on it, a rollie with a lot of Ice on it  
A pinky ring with a price on it, when he come around  
Its likely that he blunted  
With a pretty lady in them Nike's that you wanted  
It's well know he kept it on his hip like a cell phone  
If you speak with him you can pick up on his jail tone  
He used to say he wasn't going back without blowing back  
And now I'm black I wouldn't put it past him  
The D's would Harass him, til he finally blacked out  
They told my nigga to freeze, but he still backed out  
Shots fired 'til his trigger finger got tired  
All the newspapers said was 'Another Nigga Dead'  
And it's fucked up  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Fabolous]  
You can catch me in a cherry red 8-50 nice ass  
Great titties, face pretty everybody know that she date smitty  
A big time dealer that's doing a state biddin  
Who did more than his share of dirt in the world  
Enough to make a nigga think about hurtin' his girl  
So he used to tell his queen to stay to the castle  
Away from the hassle to the day that he pass through  
There's some enemies he might have who may want to blast you  
She stayed for a few years, that's until a few pairs  
Convinced her to come and hang out around New Year's  
It's been awhile, you can see it in her smile  
And she ran into her man's Co-Defendant in the trial  
Who started going on about how he moving on  
About running with them same niggas Smitty had warned about  
She slid off told her girl, she had to drop her kid off  
They found her in the parking lot, somebody blew her lid off  
And it's fucked up

"Baby girl  
You know my situation  
And sometimes I know you get impatient  
But you don't put to on a show to get patience  
Take it to court and go through litigations  
And I respect ya gangsta  
Treat you like a princess  
And put something on your neck to thank ya  
She's my pinch hitter  
When the starting lineup ain't playing right  
I come off the bench wit her  
It might sound like I'm gassing ya  
But it took time to get from the back seat to the passenger  
We been creeping and sneaking  
Just to keep it from leaking  
We so deep in our freaking  
That we don't sleep on the weekend  
Wifey  
A little bit uptight  
Wondering why he coming home in the middle of the night  
It'll be alright if y'all bump heads it'll be a fight  
But I said it'll be alright  
  
[Chorus]  
I really want to be with you (be with you)  
But I gotta be real with you (real with you)  
I can't leave you alone (lone)  
And I know I'm living wrong  
But I can't let ya go  
Your the one I want in my life (want in my life)  
Already got a wife (got a wife)  
Can't leave you alone (lone)  
And I know I'm living wrong  
But I can't let ya go  
  
You ain't ever step out of line  
Or get out a pocket  
So I made sure canary sent out your locket  
To protect you, I'll get out and cock it  
And you know the barrel of my gun is big enough to spit out a rocket  
Oh, you gonna play dumb if cops do come through  
I gotta keep the top up if my drop do come through  
But I know the boutiques and the shops you run through  
So I cop her one, and cop you one too  
You always get a daily page, weekly ring  
Plus you ain't too shy to do them freaky things  
I ain't gotta put a band on your finger  
I worry about you telling the whole world I'm your new Allen Springer  
At first you were something I denied  
Something I would slide  
Just do something in the ride  
But shorty  
There's something that you provide  
Cause the entree ain't as good without something on the side  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Uh oh, I might be leaving the earth soon  
My girl gonna kill me if she smells the scent of your perfume  
Its gonna be a clip towards if I go back  
With stains of your lip gloss on my throwback  
She won't care if I'm a platinum rapper  
If she catch me with an empty magnum wrapper  
So keep it on the down low call the carsely  
You seen what happened with Mr. Big and R. Kelly  
  
You know I get from you  
Anytime this chick is there for you  
Feelings I'm'ma share wit you  
Which makes it a Lil Mo clear for you  
  
[Chorus]

"
"You know what?  
Everybody goes through some changes in life  
Some people change for the better, some poeple change for the worse  
But umm, some people need to make that change  
You know what I mean? Change is good sometimes. You know?  
  
Why would I change? I ain't never slide down a bad pole  
Even though I'm certified over plat's sold  
They say I'm different 'cause I ride in a plat. Rolls  
But every time, we gotta ride don't this cat roll?  
I never snitch, and go and hide in a rat hole  
And I ain't givin' you nothing besides what this gat hold  
No pride, I ain't that old  
Cut off a few, but kept a few girls I decide like I'm ??  
It probably don't seem like a struggle  
But I used to dream that this thug'll balance beams just to smuggle  
It's funny same girls that didn't seem like they'd love you  
Is beggin'for your autographs ands screamin' to hug you  
It's crazy, same dudes that seem like they thug you  
Is prayin' on your downfall, schemin' to mug you  
And people that didn't give a fuck, is dreamin' to bug you  
And goin through' extreme's just to plug you, who really changed?  
  
[Chorus:]  
This game ain't change me, so don't let it change you  
If you've been real with me, I'm still real with you  
If you got love for me, I still got love for you  
If you down for me, then I'm still down for you  
If you don't fuck with me, then I don't fuck with you  
If you ain't cool with me, then I ain't cool with you  
If you won't ride with me, then I won't ride for you  
This game ain't change me, don't let it change you  
  
[Verse 2]  
Why would I change? I didn't step out of Superman's phone booth  
To remind where I'm from, I look at my own tooth  
I'm speakin' the known truth  
I ain't been living the same, since I moved under Silvia Rone's roof  
Why would I feel like I'm a stranger?  
And why should I feel like I'm in danger?  
And I'm grindin' 'till I'm right  
Whether it's on the streets, or online tryna climb sites  
I ain't blind from the limelite,  
I had my mind and my rhymes right, and signed when the time's right  
People shouldn't be hateful, they should be grateful  
But fuck it, I guess I gotta keep my three eight full  
I'm playin, the game, like I'm, supposed  
Stayin, the same, like I'm, supposed  
Ghetto Fab in da house, hip hop hustler  
One million customers, and I still bust at ya  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Why would I change when I get green like the Incredible Hulk?  
I've chilled with the richest people to the ghettoest folks  
Known a few ?? and met a few locs  
Made a few comments, and said a few jokes  
But it's gettin' me sick, someone prescribe me some medicine  
Before the fame, the vibe was way better then  
Some have even became rivals instead of friends  
Only two become liable for settlements  
I grew up watchin the  
Now they hate to see a nigga drivin' the better Benz  
That's why the clubs be, deprivin' to let us in  
They know the family bring knives and barettas in  
I'm thankful for being allowed, fans for being the crowd  
How could my head be in the clouds?  
It's strange, what the fame'll do  
But you know what? The only one who seen the change from the fame is you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm the same nigga man  
Same nigga, that ridin' with you  
Niggas that's fuckin' with you  
I'm still fuckin' with you niggas  
The same nigga, these hoe's ain't like  
Now they on my dick right? Haha... shit is crazy  
Don't let this game change you nigga...

I slide through in the name of the streets  
In the Range with the feets  
With TV screens in the frames of the seats  
I'm a pimp that slides into dames that I meet  
I rather just slide slugs in the chambers of heat  
I'm the reason other rookies in the game couldn't eat  
I'm the player Ly put in the game as a cheat  
Ya'll just tryin' to slide in the game in my cleats  
Ya'll could never be a ghetto superstar like me  
Whats the matter you confused?  
I ain't flattered or amused  
I don't know who put 'em in or what batteries they use  
But I got a clip for the slugs fatter than a fuse  
The rat tat tatta from the Uz  
That tell you  
Nobody do it sooner than son

Should be in rap caskets  
Who you think showed them the go hard with stunting  
And who you think showed 'em that those broads was nothing  
And who you think showed 'em that those cars was something  
And when fathers day came I got no card or nothing  
So I ain't out here trying to expose frauds for nothing  
And I ain't out here pulling these hoes cards for nothing  
They was bitches on deck y'all, made 'em queens  
Watching sports with a chick that got ball player dreams (swish)  
I'm watching these dogs play with my old bones  
I feel like n-ggas done found one of my old phones  
We in the house, y'all looking to hold loans  
And when the market was up, you wouldn't have sold homes  
So this the foreclosure of the wannabe  
If you can't be yourself, then who you gonna be?  
Dad to your swag, your style was like a son to me  
Your stylist got thank yous, you never sent one to me  
Lets pray for 'em  
Y'all repeat this one with me

So I might she'd tears as I put on my gloves  
But I won't show emotions when I fill him with slugs  
Cause n-ggas die everyday here  
And you can get hit picking ya seed up from daycare  
N-ggas don't play fair  
That's why I'm straightforward, f-ck being all discrete  
If I can knock 'em off quick, f-ck beefing all for weeks  
So we was up late night hunting, y'all was sleep  
Cause we the wolves hiding in clothes, y'all the sheep  
Who taught ya the game, who showed y'all the streets?  
And who bought 'em them things they sold y'all for cheap?  
And who came up the bill when them hoes called police?  
Now you fronting so I gotta expose y'all to see  
Ungrateful motherf-cker, who fed you when you was hurting? (me)  
Whenever drama came up, who was putting the work in? (me)  
I was spitting live on hot 9  
You was still rehearsing  
Already my son and this was before I met you in person  
So no matter how many colorful fake chains you purchase  
Like that bullshit you wearing

"Hey my nigga do me a favor. (what's that my nigga?)

Hey hey hey hey  
I take it in  
I blow it out  
On the courthouse steps after they throw it out  
Bentley waiting by the curb I spur it out  
Doors don't open they self the chauffeur get out  
My exhale made anything a foggy blur  
I make my way through the reporters and photographers  
I take my lady's hand I shake my attorney's  
Slide in the back seat and let's begin this journey  
Told the driver hold off before we pushed out  
I let my window down and out comes a kush cloud  
Any last words?  
Justice has been served  
Now back to the streets that's what the hustlers deserve  
  
Well alright okay  
I've been gone and away  
For too long a mistake  
But right now I feel awake

Hey hey hey hey  
I ain't lose a step  
I ain't miss a beat  
Thugs have emotions we miss the streets  
We kiss the heat  
We love the block  
We rubber band the money we black glove the glock  
I'm screamin' free at last free at last  
She used to send me pictures so I could see that ass  
That's real talk that's a real bitch  
Fly as I left the minx still fit  
They know my name but in case they didn't know so  
Appear in a casket courtesy of loso  
So you should have your shit packed  
I'm a need ya to not be here when I get back  
  
Well alright okay  
I've been gone and away  
For too long a mistake  
But right now I feel awake  
I'm feeling like I'm back (just like I'm back)  
Said I'm feeling like I'm back (feel like I'm back)  
Said I'm feeling like I'm back (just like I'm back)  
Said I'm feeling like I'm back (feel like I'm back)  
  
Hey hey hey hey  
Aye daddy's home after a long day  
I'm from the hood I came a long way  
But I ain't goin' back I'm just visitin'  
I hear the streets talkin' I'm just listenin'  
If they ain't talkin' money I'm out my business then  
If that ain't what it is then what is it then?  
I'm out here grizzyin' swizzyin'  
It's me bitches sittin' in a phantom  
Got the streets back but I didn't pay the ransom  
My father who fathered you treat you like my grandson  
I came back for it like I left it nigga  
You try me you get more than a efa f it nigga  
  
Well alright okay  
I've been gone and away  
For too long a mistake  
But right now I feel awake

No Brian Pumper jewels just large links  
A lot of ice in 'em I'm talking large drinks  
Lets see what the Audemar thinks  
My necklace make chicks Nicki Minaj blink  
There are no challengers F what the Dodge think  
I'm riding in the... my garage stinks  
Cocunut Ciroc, coco-loso  
Pretty boy swag never coke my nose though  
Got your baby momma eating off a lead plates  
It mean the World to her, to me it's just a cheap date  
Plenty fish in the sea and I keep bait  
You're a broke rollerblader, cheapskate!  
My jeep plate say ""Tune in to the game""

Listen up son, I'm immune to all the lame  
If I fathered your style, put a Jr. to your name  
I searched the whole planet, there's no comp on Earth  
Sky blue J's (Jordan's), look like I stomped a smurf  
  
I said life is but a dream  
Aint always what it seems  
Meanwhile get your cake red velvet butter cream  
Raise your glass now lets toast to when we didn't have  
Hustle plus muscle equal success, I did the math!  
I see haters in passing, yeah they 'round  
I be on the way up, they be on the way down  
Now I can sit and talk sh-t like Skip Bayless  
You looking for these shoes baby you can skip payless  
Won't be on Craigslist, lifestyle A-list  
On my way to Vegas I part playlist  
Yeah it's just another page in my success story  
I make my worst enemies wish the best for me

This the flow that put haters on their deathbed  
And make the chicks blow the whistle give me rev head  
Somebody call 911 like 'clef said  
'Fore my man's n 'em black out, Meth Red!  
The newspaper say young rapper left dead  
The only suspect they have is young funeral  
And when you see him  
He might be on his goony proud  
So you put him up in the air George Clooney style  
Slow motion for me so just slim juvenile  
Don't sh-t move a dude can't move his bowels  
Catch it like Larry Fitzgerald  
Kurt Warner bullets coming out the 5ths bureau  
Baby I'mma make it, my sh-ts thorough  
You shootin blanks your sh-ts durrough  
The competi... can't hold hold me  
But first lay in a box and cross your hands for me  
Fan base killer blame your loss of fans on me  
I triple what you see's like I'm Ross' man homie (Triple C)  
Dudes get to New York like loso's dead Tony  
You pick the place everybody cross the land for me  
Keep it real, I can't endorse or stand phoney's  
'Less we arm wrestle don't force my hand homie  
These YSL's cost a grand only  
My white girl bought that Porsche Cayenne for me  
Sweet, sweet like Georgia peaches  
School of heart, I get brain from gorgeous teachers  
Funeral in the house, no mortgage either  
Any competition he see the boy just ethers  
I can't feel my face this that Boston George reefer  
You lie if you say I aint hotter than August weether

You can't see me, I mean ever!  
Ever ever, Andre 3 G  
This is me G, Gucci print G-G  
Clean ice neck full of frozen Fiji  
Been in the game long as Mario, Luigi  
No Juvenile, Wayne, Turk or B.G.  
I'm still Hot Boyz but it's stutter gang jack

Right here  
Right here

Here's another one  
  
[Fabolous]  
You need to holla at somebody real such as myself  
Won't nobody do as much as myself  
And its so real ill hop out and get the dutches myself  
For a pretty girl as such as yaself  
'cause ima busy man I don't see too much for myself  
And sometimes it be hard to get in touch with myself  
But I, make the time when I have to  
Learn to take my time and be careful when dealing wit women  
There's some who be willing and skimming  
And dive in to relationships 'cause I got a million to swim in  
They'll throw it to you faster than schilling and clemens  
But feelings ain't the only thing that you can catch now  
Some throw lawyers that you hoping they fetch thous  
Others pass diseases that you can catch now  
But in my minutes so lone I think about this crazy world  
And.. I don't want to live in it alone  
Come on  
  
[Chorus: Lil Mo]  
Ill give you all my love  
And you can always trust  
My loyalty, honesty, and security (and i'll never)  
Ill never leave (no, no, no)  
Can none of these other chicks fuck wit me  
So holla at somebody real (cause i)  
'cause I'm so real  
  
[Fabolous]  
(real love) I'm searching for a real love like j blige in 92  
but I pray I will find you  
And say whether the storm will leave the gray skies behind you  
The fake may try to blind you  
That's why I stay fly like I do  
And no I can trust everybody that I say hi and bye to  
First I need a girl that may die as my boo  
Then I may try the I do's  
But, I refuse to be trick  
Or used by a chick  
Who gets amusement of kicks  
Out of abusing my dick  
When its real I'm all in it  
But I don't want the scars of love that you get when you fall in it  
(no) before it didn't matter who  
Now I look for some with a little attitude  
I could chitter chatter to, good looking  
But witty and compatible  
Long hair wit a fatty too  
And that'll do  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[Lil Mo]  
No I'm not trying to pressure you  
But my loves to incredible  
For to waste  
In front of your face  
Then I give you something you can feel  
To let you know your hollering at somebody real  
  
[Fabolous]  
I need to holla at somebody real could that be you  
The feelings that I feel could that be true  
Most cats lay where the hood rats be boo  
But I'm the kinda cat that strays away  
That's til somebody real sways my way  
Then I might spend some days always  
On a Asia bay  
Eating food made the Cajun way  
And sippin ga lil saki  
Blowing a lil brocoli  
But this world is full of fluzi's  
And bullshit usually  
I pull I'm choosy  
And on this joint and at this point  
I know I need to holla at somebody real  
For real

About to get real funny style in a minute man

"Yeah, (raw)  
I got you  
R.i.p to the competition  
Split these niggas to the white meat  
  
Bitch I'm raw,  
So hearing that any nigga out cook me  
Is suspect as R. Kelly with girl scout cookies  
When you talking to a pro watch ya mouth rookie  
Go in ya shit have ya teeth playin' mouth hookie  
Nice, you niggas must of heard me wrong.  
I blame them horses when I turn that Porsche turby on (vrrm)  
My engine gettin' his Kentucky derby on,  
Seats is brunette paint is dirty blond  
Speaking of dirty blond's  
Say hi to curvy Don Fergie John  
With the body movement of a turbion  
I just watch her,  
It's been a hectic year  
So I sit and get fried  
Call the weed electric chair  
But y'all on death row, one request left  
You looking for ya girl oh she just left  
Her and my dick just became B.F.F's  
Then I threw her out like jazzy J. E.F.F  
I'm raw dawg, y'all safe sex  
You dicks belong in latex not tape decks  
You can't see me  
Neither can the flunkies under you  
My shit bananas, like a monkey number two  
I'm bigger than that  
More like guerrilla though  
Nick name funeral got that from this killer flow.  
Er'thing still a go, my pockets be extra fat  
Big money on deck like A Rods next to bat  
Shit  
Somebody contact the tabloids  
I'm a big deal like a contract from bad boy  
Yeah, it's all good baby baby  
My swag plays a big part so it's all gravy  
We hit the club like Nino in the C.M.B  
Pretty mixed bitch I just call ha P.M.B  
Watch ya step baby gettin' out that G.M.C  
You bust yo ass girl we both gon' be on T.M.Z  
Don't be shy let them cameras expose you  
The worst that can happen is I Amber Rose you  
People running up like damn I knows you  
Hey ain't you? Yeah I am that bitch  
Six feet deep nigga, yeah I am that ditch.  
Throw it in the bag in a recession, I am that rich  
I'm under close watch niggas got binoculars  
I ain't what's poppin' bitch I'm what's popular  
If I'm the one to go at, niggas what's stopping ya  
I call my gun Nadia, and I be finger poppin' her  
Keep that bitch cummin' like blaka blaka  
Go to ya head like a shot a vodka  
Rock a sick fit call a doctor potna'  
You think I had a Gucci deal Waka Flocka  
Yeah I am too fucking raw (what you say?)  
Yeah you heard me I am too fucking raw

"[Chorus]  
When you grow up in my hood  
Help don't show up in my hood  
Gang signs go up in my hood, just 'cause you in..my..hood  
Feel like I'm trapped in my hood  
Young kids get clapped in my hood  
That's why I'm strapped in my hood, just 'cause you in..my..hood  
In..my..hood, in my hood, in my hood  
  
[Verse 1: Fabolous]  
I'm always close to..  
Feeling like a corner stander, stoop sitter, or hallway post-er  
No matter where I go it's always 'posed to, feel just like I'm (in my hood)  
Cops drive in it every 5 minutes, look at your faces, pat your waists'  
Try to find the stash where the gats and base is, I can't say that they racist  
But I know.. it ain't the same in they town  
And as fucked up as it may sound (in my hood)  
It's 2 ways to make it happen off the streets  
Balling on the courts or rapping off the beats  
You hear the shells tappin' off the 'crete, when they clappin' off the heat  
Then the yellow tape's trappin off the street  
But that's the way we was raised  
Preying to God, hoping that he keep us out the way of them strays  
  
[Chorus]  
[Verse 2: Fabolous]  
They drink 'til the cups dry, eat 'til the plate's clean  
Niggaz be in state greens 'fore they turn 18  
'Round here you never let the beef slide twice  
Everybody raised on 4 wings and beef fried rice  
Them mothers are getting younger today  
Got one by the hand, one in the stroller and one on the way  
We don't have role models  
But we got them handguns that hold hollows (in my hood)  
Ain't no diplomas or degrees  
But you can get high from the aroma of the trees (in my hood)  
I know it like navigation, and fuck having patience  
I'ma get mine, you better get yours, 'cause everyday is a struggle  
And One-Time ride through everyday just to bug you  
That's how it is, 'cause your rights be wrong  
And everybody got a white T on, when you're in..my..hood  
  
[Chorus]  
[Verse 3: Fab]  
We try to make the most of what we got  
You either been hit, or been close to gettin shot (in my hood)  
Any nigga that boast be getting got  
And dopeheads fiend to get a dose of what we got  
And young niggaz be like they slow  
But you give them a blunt..bet they roll the weed like a pro  
If you trick it's not a problem it gets you laid  
But if you stick without a condom, it gets you AIDS  
No Sesame Street, kids watch BET  
Look up to niggaz that don't got a GED  
I know a dude with the deadbeat tag  
Kids don't got diapers but he ridin' in the red G-Wag'  
In the hood, you and your beef is sure to bump heads  
And everybody grew up sleepin on bunk beds  
They telling me to vote..and I would  
If it made a change in my hood..mu'fucka.

Shawty you autumn time cool  
But they don't see your beauty f-ck all them blind fools  
Body so mean that it's border line cruel  
Work 8 to 3, then from 4 to 9 school  
Dominican girl who knows more than mongul  
She say lets stay in the room and order Dom Cruz  
It sounds like a plan  
'Cause girl once I got you by your limbs  
That guy who spot you at the gym can't put it down like I can  
I wanna take you places further than where your feet walk  
Why scream when your voice is better for sweet talk  
A little accent, cute ass lisp  
First a toast is said then a flute glass kiss  
I like it when you whip yo hair, but that's Willow fault  
I speak body language, f-ck pillow talk  
We can wake up 'round noon on a saturday  
And make a f-ckin movie, now that's a matinee  
But on the weekdays I wanna be yo' wake up call  
Kiss yo' face before you put that make up all over it  
You go from gettin' ready at the bathroom sink to gettin' bent over it  
Then it's over with  
Now you rushin' to work, ipod touchin' yo purse  
Ima let you go but not without touchin' it first  
When you think 'bout it later you blush and you smirk  
Your co-workers thinkin' you got a crush on the clerk  
You always talk about yo boss, about how much of a jerk he is  
But tell me baby does he touch you and flirt?  
'Cause that's how such and such get hurt  
And lame ass n-ggas start bringin' crutches to work  
I know you got it girl, I trust in your work  
Ladies is pimps too, go 'head brush off the dirt  
I be here when you get off with dutches and purp  
I want you after dinner, your such a dessert  
The night is lookin' sweet the only thing I'm tryna bite is yo physique  
And in most cases with you  
Only thing I wanna fight is gettin sleep 'cause I eat and go to sleep  
You know I is in the sheets, niceeeee  
Don't touch it, let my eyes do the undressin'  
Play Usher and take ya back to confessions  
I wanna crush ya' nevermind the tongue wrestlin'  
Wont rush ya, one question

You're the kinda girl that has a little bit more fun  
I'm literally yours hun  
Cause' I never seen a ass so big with a waist as little as yours hun  
And by the expressions on them hotties grills  
I know they want to holla at somebody real  
And I'm usually lookin' for somebody skilled  
Enough to make a nigga say aye aye aye yo niggas get mad 'cause I may slay
they hoe  
But I don't want to let the a.k. spray so  
Stop face fightin' me, like ya face frighten' me  
I do this every year so I ain't never scared  
I do this everywhere and you ain't never there  
They sayin' this everywhere, how could you never hear

If you want to roll with the thugs tonight  
Lights, camera, action can you feel the hype

If you want to live up and free your life  
Come through let we kick it 'til a morning light  
If you want to roll with tha thugs tonight  
Well its alright, baby its alright

So get with it, we want (to) hit it, we nah quit it  
And I like tha way you body set and how your clothes fit it  
I want you give me some of it because minute by minute  
Temperature it all a rise because you thighs and all you hips, style  
You shockin' it, you a rock it, you a kill it  
And a one thing the Dutty Paul want to predict  
Say by tha end of tha night you will be chillen' with tha click  
Flossin' it, money we tossin' it

We naw ease up...We ain't stallin', grab the girls all in

Over here the liquor is light blue, the chronic is light green  
They wearin' the right shoe, they put on the tight jeans  
They bringin' me right through', I walk with a slight lean  
My style excites you, I know what that might mean  
Aye, I'ma freaky scorpio  
Yo, tryna' leave with your skio  
Aye, but its mandatory tho'  
Yo' after me let shorey go

It's have you makin' one of the sounds that Busta does (woo HAH!)  
They love me just because  
I'm in the gallardo, laughing like Ricky Ricardo (Ha ha ha ha)  
With the 4-pounder, pretty gangsta nigga  
I'm the co-founder, I know the difference between pimps and hoe-hounders  
I can tell when they ain't learn to lean

I roll up wrist in chrome, burning green like what's good

God was in a good mood, on the day he made me  
I'm from the projects, it's the way it made me  
And I wouldn't change it for nothing  
I stay on point, that's ''cause I know the danger of stuntin'  
But the aim is like I'll be at the ranges or somethin'  
It takes a gangsta, to know a gangsta  
That's why we look at you like a stranger or somethin'  
''cause we can tell by the body language you frontin'  
And it take a little more than lettin' ya pants sag  
Ya sand bag, tryna jump on the band wag  
I'll put the red dot on you like a Japan flag  
You need some high heels and a handbag

I'm in the ten minutes to nine, leanin' on 'em  
Like I'm ten minutes behind, fuck a hundred shots  
Give me a .40 cal wit' ten in it, I'm fine  
Just spray, and shit'll get you ten minute of shine  
Keep a friend in it, that's ten cented for mine  
Keep the rims in it, that spin in it for mine  
Can't see him in it, I been tinted up mine  
But you know a nigga look oh so gangsta  
Oh no thank ya, I earned my key  
My name'll get you fucked up, and burners tee  
That's gangsta love, from the heart  
Yo I told y'all from the start  
And now (y'all know whoooooooo)  
Keep it G'd up, I can't slow down, these creep's speed up

How she got you holdin' guns but you call that hoe your friend  
You ain't posed to bring her home, what do you show her in?

But if you try me nigga,  
I will be your caller I-D.  
And that means I got your number.  
Please don't make me dial it,  
That could land your fly ass on the ground just like a pilot.  
So just do me a solid.  
Y'all stay in pocket like wallets,  
'cause you can't see me.  
Close eye-lids.  
Huh, nitey night.  
I'm with a model chick.  
Tyra thick, Heidi's height,  
Body suits, body tight.  
Yeah, I clean up nice.  
Catch me on a tidy night,  
Might be Gucci'd down to the tidy whites.  
OK it's loso,  
Everybody knows so.  
My son is the heir to the thrown,  
Prince Joso.  
So daddy need money,  
Mummy need new truies.  
Baby needs new shoes,  
Preferably the new Louis.  
The swaggers in his jeans,  
He was born fly.  
Them Philly bitches say the ball keep his jaunt fly.  
Then Reggie Kush shot us up in Californi.

Y'all don't know the half, not even a third.  
Put a dick in your ear and fuck what you heard.  
She tried to pull my fly south,  
I ain't want the bird.  
Because I been killin' these hoes,  
These niggas just drop dead.  
In the drop head,  
All we do is bop heads.  
To the side,  
Like busta in the Pepsi add.  
With my Columbiana mamma,  
Yep she bad. (she bad)  
She in the latest shoe that Giuseppe had.  
Blow game like the late dizzy Gillespie had.  
That's some good jaw.  
Pop quiz,  
Good score.  
She call her pussy Medellin,  
That good raw.  
For you little cheap fucks,  
Hood whores.  
You niggas soft in the middle,  
Call them hood smalls.  
Everybody on the block going cuckoo.  
Phantom doors open like the clock that goes cuckoo.  
Birds poppin' out.  
Sittin' on the hood,  
Check my bird droppings out.  
I'm shittin' on the hood.  
Sleepin' time, niggas.  
The hand that rocks the cradle for you nursery rhyme niggas.

Yea, slow down baby, let me be your yellow light  
The way we met was wrong, let me say hello right  
You need a mellow night, a break from this ghetto life  
The way I roll make them haters wanna yellow dice  
She say what matters is that you keep them stilettos nice  
And when you slap this ass, it shake like jello, right?  
Well alright, roll them cigarellos tight  
I nicknamed her bape chicken and yellow rice  
Pretty brown skin, long blonde hair  
And she know they talking but she never gon' care  
Cause when you balling trash-talk is what you gon' hear  
I can't imagine what a fall upon lebron's ear  
Always been the girl that didn't have to wait in line  
Niggas buy her watches just for making time  
Fake say ""give it up"" never had to ask  
They call her the stick up girl that never wore a mask  
Baby, ain't you tired of life in this fast lane?  
Packing luggage, rushing, trying to catch that last plane?  
There's some dudes who take pride in trying to gas dames  
The same dudes will see her and give they last name  
Funny how I became the apple of her eye  
The game went south and I'm a rapper from ny  
Don't get me wrong: lil mama love ""trap or die""  
But through it all she kept her watch on the dapper guy  
And fell in love with a 2009 verse  
She said before we met, I fucked her in her mind first  
We crossed paths, a mixture of karma and luck  
I walked in strong, mentally palming my nuts  
I got em swarming and stuck, she calm in the cut  
You know me? I can spot a swan from a duck  
My approach? Smoother than an armani tux  
The diamonds going off, like the alarm on a truck  
The small talk, warming her up, she palming her cup  
She told me that I make her laugh and I'm charming as fuck  
But for now she had to go, the chat just quickly changed  
She was chilling, now she leaving, I mean that was kinda strange  
Asked ""can we meet again?"" she said ""that can be arranged""  
And I'm sure we both have phone numbers that can be exchanged  
We did, she slid, that'd a be explained  
But for now she hopped into a platinum-colored range

And rats die ugly, die with kids  
These niggas is snitching and still living  
I hope my words are like razors to the bitches  
Niggas pretend like they actually in  
But when it go down they f-ck around and be them  
That blood look familiar when it's leaking  
If you scared, go see a Deacon nigga  
That aint love

Life is but a dream  
Aint always what it seems  
Meanwhile get your cake red velvet butter cream  
Raise your glass and lets toast to when we didn't have  
Hustle plus muscle equal success, I did the math!  
I see these haters in passing, yeah they 'round  
I be on the way up, they be on the way down  
Now I can sit and talk shit like Skip Bayless  
You looking for these shoes baby you can skip payless  
Lifestyle A-list, young black and famous  
Bunch of bad bitches in an Ipod playlist  
Just anothger page in my success story  
I make my worst enemies wish the best for me

Niggas ain't seen fly till they seen I

The Laperle match well with these Feragamis  
Killer shoe game these are just a pair of hamies  
Mommy I get up like QB's  
Na, she ain't stepped in blood, those are Lou B's  
We don't follow, unless you lead us into VIP  
When they know your face, they don't need to see ID  
I can see the bottles coming from a mile away  
Sparklers on the top act like they don't know to stop (stop, stop)  
She fuck with niggas like Fabolous  
Cause to tell the truth, baby life's fabolous  
  
It's the fabulous life, oh I be living that

Get your money right, you could be living that

How you living, what? How you living, what?  
How you living, oh I be living fabulous  
  
I bow my head and I praise that  
We be there and back before the Rose's flat  
Picture me anywhere a clown stays at  
I don't think so, homey don't play that  
Everything is BOSS, like a Rick ad-lib  
Take it to house like it's Trick Dad Crib  
We hit Miami like a hurricane  
Shorty poolside, one piece Veroaine  
She the baddest bitch in them Jackie O shades  
Flabby beach mat, she don't give me no shade  
Hold the heat down, she don't even know Wade  
Nigga get smoked like cigarette tote  
I like her soft kiss and I dig her wet throat  
I love her booty bounce like cigarette boats  
And it won't quit  
She can't wear skinny jeans cause her ass don't fit  
Real shit  
  
It's the fabulous life, oh I be living that  
Oh I be living that, oh I be living that  
Get your money right, you can be living that  
You can be living that, you can be living that

How you living, what? How you living, what?  
How you living, oh I be living fabulous  
  
Got a rich bitch on the way  
That for real though, just like Wanda say  
She just wanna rock my world in the Wonder way  
I'm sitting at the airport like Andele  
Fist I saw the Luggy with the Louie monogram  
Then I saw my baby like a sonogram  
On the runway, just me and Bentley  
I open doors, you ain't gotta G the gent me  
I was thinking Knicks game, court side  
She put her hands in my pants, I let that thought slide  
We can get it on, but there's no leg room  
No water bed, just a boat with a bedroom  
Now you tell me who can top this  
Hey, laying on the deck topless  
Got two different dames, it's a Fabolous thing  
One white, one yellow, like Fabolous chain  
  
It's the fabulous life, oh I be living that  
Oh I be living that, oh I be living that

I would've been your friend till the end bitch  
Guess there ain't no friends in this shit bidness  
Just a bunch of assholes in the shit bidness  
But they won't flush me down the toilet bowl without my tissue  
These bitches talk shit out the same mouth they kiss you  
These niggas kiss ass with the same mouth that diss you  
Eww, you niggas disgust me  
And they ain't talkin bout shit unless they discuss me  
Let's talk about how, I'm killin errything I touches  
Or how I walked in this game with no crutches  
No Diddy, No Dupri, No Dr. Dre  
No Cash Money from Baby and no rocs from Jay  
And I'm still here  
We still here  
What does this break dude?... It's still here  
And dude talk, concernin New York  
When I was runnin the city you was learnin to walk  
So I watched you niggas take they first steps  
And I was happy for ya, daddy was clappin for ya  
But, wasn't for me prolly wouldnt've happened for ya  
So I rest my case  
I'm a rappin lawyer  
That's unless you wanna talk bad bitches  
Section full of bridezillas, that's mad bitches  
No words, I describe em with letters best  
They pretty as can be, curvy as the letter ""S""  
They keep it G, they sweet as T  
Look good in the passenger seat of V  
They ride double are, smell like double C  
The Bags are L. V., D, or a double G  
Fly as hell, shades wire cell  
On E, sippin P. J., high as hell  
And please don't even talk about swag  
I'm cool and collective  
A Fool with perspective  
I'm far from being typical my respect is reciprocal  
I already came up  
You still on the zipper pull  
And I would say my style is 5th Fab meets Brooklyn  
I keep the hood watchin, I got the streets lookin  
They watch what I do, so they know what to do  
Lil money never told big money what to do  
Money talks, if you speak guapanese  
A language better known if you gettin cheddar holmes  
If not get a loan, use that like Rosetta Stone  
And that way you can holla bout a dolla  
I hear em cryin broke, they holla like a toddler  
Come holla at yo gualla, don't holla at sovallas  
You'll end up down under tryna holla at Koalas  
I keep that nine on me, ala Iguodala  
We can get it jumpin like the drolics on Impala  
I feel like Neno lettin em rock wallas off the colla  
Somebody tell me something, What the fuck happened?  
Somebody talk to me, muthafuck rappin  
They infiltrated the game, but who let in the pookies?  
Kingpins is snitchin that shit is not lookey  
So fuck new friends unless they stay solo  
Cuz who gon' watch you back after you kill Manolo?  
Isn't it ironic Santana's own fella stabbed him  
The king of New York die while I yellow cabbed him  
No Carlito's way  
When I spot a hater drop him like a hot potatoe  
Youahead, got me later

Layin' in hospital beds with ice bags on 'em

Diamond chain with a Jesus Christ tag on 'em  
Maybe I'm just feelin' the Kush  
Everybodys against war but right now I'm feelin like Bush  
When you get money theres nothin' that you can't do on the Earth  
Its not a problem for niggas to plant you in the Earth

The shooters are beggin' me show who the guys is

Sometimes I blow this paper like it's just a joint  
Sometimes I look at change like it's just some coins

It's perspective, which angle you looking from?  
When you take a chance, ever wonder who you took it from?  
I'm from brooklyn son, got no problem taking nothing  
So I figured I could take nothing and make it something  
Tell 'em faking ass niggas they won't make it frontin

Got me on some shit, that might be what the stink is  
You might just be cool it might be what you thinking  
It might be something in her eye but to me, she's winking

Paano na ang bukas ko  
Nasanay na sa piling mo  
  
Hanap ka  
At umaasa pang sana'y  
Muling makapiling ka

Na sana'y magbalik  
Wala nang mahihiling pa  
Kung maaari pang muling makapiling ka  
  
Hanggang ngayo'y nasa isip ko  
Ang kahapong kay saya  
Di maunawaan  
Kung bakit kinailangang ika'y mawala

"I've been with you boy, for 'years' is quite a while  
But getting to sensual is really not my style.  
You know I love you and I like it just like this.  
Sometimes I feel like giving you more than just a kiss.  
  
But baby it's wrong  
Baby it's not my kind of game  
If I give it to you now, our love will never be the same  
It won't be long. We gotta play our love just right  
I know you know the time will come  
But baby for tonight  
  
[Chorus]  
Let's take it slow, so slow  
Anywhere you want to go  
Baby for you I'll lay it on the line  
You oughtta know (oughtta know), boy I ain't got no where to go I'll give it
to you, only to you  
We gotta take it real slow  
  
We got together you know I feel the fire.  
Burns up inside me, all the natural desire.  
I know that you feel it too. I know you want to flow.  
Dreaming about it and the fire starts to grow.  
  
But baby it's wrong  
Baby it's not my kind of game  
If I give it to you now, our love will never be the same  
It won't be long. We gotta play our love just right  
I know you know the time will come  
but baby for tonight

Lightning actually hittin' thunda',  
Even Stevie Wonder wonder,  
Why yo girl get home on time so much I had to change my numba',  
Sarcasm, these bitches need to ride 'em while I pass 'em,  
I wouldn't even give that bitch a orgasm,  
Miraculously my niggas stand beside, not in back of me,  
So disrespect my faculty, how dare you have audacity,  
The compact to capacity I cash out automatically,  
I spit these rhymes so radically, sporadically, fatality.  
  
[Chorus]  
I got the green, drank, pills, blow,  
Runnin' round the town gettin' money I suppose,  
I'm the gingerbread man  
I'm the gingerbread man

I got the green, drank, pills, blow,  
I Cant get up, sleep, jus' keep knockin' on my door,

Gingerbread man, I got white, I got white,  
Trap house bunkin' up all night, take flight,  
Droppin' 10 bases? its jumpin' that white?  
Trees to that paper so I'm something like a kite,  
Loud stanky kush and it tellin' me to light,  
Extra loud diamonds and its lookin' like a light,  
Rolli'n stay money and my pockets just glide,  
Everyday diamonds cause they don't like to hide,  
V-V-S light yea so you block yo eyes,  
Burnt color diamonds like a sweet potato pie,  
Hit ya color diamonds and get ratchet like a fly?  
The brick man, the bread man I don't tell no lies.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Money Mane gettin' it in, I'm only in it to win  
I ain't come to say I'm the champ, I get bored and do it again  
If I ev'red across a tranny, I ain't asked her for a twin  
cause its number time, done came to gather up all my inns  
it's fifteen minutes to ten, eighth in and I'm drinkin' gin  
I could act like we were fiends, but I dont like to pretend  
I got 30 stacks new Ajax, it's the future price of my air max  
I'm addicted to abllin' I hear Lennox Mall and I relapse  
Your slimfast, little bankroll, my stash getting way to fat  
No push-up, just cook-ups, I'm booked up, I don't wanna lapse  
There's Money Mane, and Juice Mane, and Gucci Mane and ol' Brickman  
I got juice all in my kitchen so my house smell like cocaine

Short skirt with no thongs on

But I'm a beat it up  
I'm a beat it up  
I'm a beat it up  
He can lay you down  
But I'm a beat it up  
I'm a beat it up  
  
I hopped up out my bed  
Got my swag on  
Stronger than fillet Mignon  
Two Gs blown just for cologne  
Money never limited  
So Icey with benefits  
My driver needs a passport  
All my cars are immigrants!  
It's so sickening  
History you're witnessing  
I had a girl she quit me  
Now I'm single want to get with me?  
Sticky again they stick to me  
If you see your chick with GUCCI  
Think before you confronting ruley  
Ain't my fault your lady choosin'  
430 stepped on purp it  
08 verty rollin' dirty  
Wardrobe clean as this detergent  
Got your girlfriend picking purses  
Say she lonely  
Gucci only one with to meet me in person  
When she met me home  
My bitch told me that shes over first  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Your girlfriend keep callin' me  
I feel like she stalkin' me  
You at home  
And she with me  
So morning it's an argument  
Gucci Mane be doggin' it  
Beatin' her down  
Straight poundin' it  
Drillin' on your sheets  
Got your blanket at the laundromat  
Wait baby girl throw it back  
Old man might catch heart attack  
Gucci Mane not hardly that  
Smack you like I'm mad at that  
Swear this sex so passionate  
Oral sex she mastered that  
Pornographic poses  
Like she posing for the internet  
Wait I was not finished yet  
Never been a minute man  
Always been a business man  
Gotta catch your feelings man  
Got a man?  
Oh really now?  
Acting like I give a damn!  
  
Used to like her now I don't  
Got a real short attention span  
Gucci!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Gucci Trey Songz put it on  
My shirt off when I perform  
She say this her favorite song  
She got on my favorite thong  
She so hot  
Too hot to touch  
Truthfully too much for lames  
Gucci mane I'm extra game  
So extra rubbers I'm a bring  
Got your main thang screaming Gucci  
Every Tuesday night we cool whip  
Wish we could do it more often  
But I'm often somewhere flossin'  
Lay it down like carpet barbie  
Aston martin double park it  
Beat it like we got a problem  
Pop her till she call me poppa  
Freakin' partners  
Why we never bother with a second option  
Hoppin' got the mattress poppin'  
Rockin' while her girlfriend watchin'  
Freakin' partners  
Why they never bother with a second option  
Hoppin' got the mattress poppin'  
Rockin' while her girlfriend watchin'

"Break a line to a bunch of dimes then you grind up  
Money got me sure my ass can't even hold my pants up  
Twenty niggas standing on the flat all getting off  
Found a jacket, get em bro, late with his head soft  
Try me in the six, I'ma raise this forty five up  
Shave a brick, put it back together, that's a lineup  
We mix the chick, use a little cut, that's a temp fade  
And if he got a chopper never ever bring a switchblade  
  
I'm a multimillionaire, I got a couple hundred on me  
And no more mac, I told the scrap, I make you stick yourself like Tony  
I give a nigga my whole stash if he can take this jewelry off me  
And I'm so bossy in my altar, smoking kush and sipping coffee  
Walk, walk, walk  
  
They said I couldn't get rich, I hid that money (pick up that money)  
All that sideline talk don't make no money  
Bout that bread, y'all niggas out here too funny (y'all niggas too funny)  
Hit your bitch then leave her with no money (she broke)  
They said I couldn't get rich, I hid that money (I did it)  
All that sideline talk don't make no money (y'all niggas out crocked)  
Bout that bread, y'all niggas out here too funny  
I hit your bitch then leave her with no money  
  
Money is a motto, if you speak it then I'm with ya  
Any sideline nigga, they get cropped out the picture  
If you ask me, yeah I'm ready, got your hoe on a mission  
Catch me running through your city like a damn politician  
Boy I'm all about a chick  
She don't ask no questions, boy she all about the nig  
Say she want to crash so I let my partners rip  
Looking at this nigga that stay flyer than a jet  
They don't hear me yet  
  
I'ma get that check, that money  
Y'all niggas out here funny  
You know y'all nigga on the go  
Gotta have that green light gumby  
I'ma fool with it though, too clumsy  
On the clock monday through sunday  
Everyday gotta get that money  
And I learned that from the big homie  
  
They said I couldn't get rich, I hid that money (pick up that money)  
All that sideline talk don't make no money  
Bout that bread, y'all niggas out here too funny (y'all niggas too funny)  
Hit your bitch then leave her with no money (she broke)  
They said I couldn't get rich, I hid that money (I did it)  
All that sideline talk don't make no money (y'all niggas out crocked)  
Bout that bread, y'all niggas out here too funny  
I hit your bitch then leave her with no money  
  
I'm like eleven of them back, give me that fucking walkie talkie  
Then get lost cause when you said you'd never cross me then you crossed me  
And these hoes count the vapors like biz marquee  
It's since they brought me these keys, niggas idolize me  
Critics criticize me, haters sabotage me  
I get angry then I cut through whoever camouflaged veep  
Better workers, that's my killers, ain't gonna jeopardize me  
I know these fuck niggas with they could paralyze me  
Walk, walk, walk  
  
They said I couldn't get rich, I hid that money (pick up that money)  
All that sideline talk don't make no money  
Bout that bread, y'all niggas out here too funny (y'all niggas too funny)  
Hit your bitch then leave her with no money (she broke)  
They said I couldn't get rich, I hid that money (I did it)

"They shot my homie for nothing, killed my homie for nothing  
I smoke blunts everyday, to try to wish it didn't happen  
But I can't bring him back, cause I am only a mortal  
People think I'm a god, but to me I'm only normal  
I used to trap on the corner, trap ? with the thermal  
I had that TEC in the bushes, run up on me I burn you  
Folks they come to Atlanta, just to ride through my zone  
Wanna see where I trapped at, they wanna see what's my home  
In the place that I said, everything that I meant  
I got so many pounds in the apartment think I got dreads  
I got money in the bed, so I sleep with the bread  
If you play with Bricksquad, them might take off your head  
  
I'm so high, fuck nigga I'm so high  
I'm so high, baby girl I'm so high  
She get high, your baby girl, she get fucked up  
And he get high, you know that nigga fuck his nose up  
I'm so high, fuck nigga I'm so high  
I'm so high, fuck nigga I'm so high  
She so high, but bitch with me so she good night  
And you so broke, you looking at us with all this ice  
  
Bitch I bigger pay her or get bigger paid, everyday is a bigger day  
Bigger nigga get a bigger gun, hit his ass in his bigger face  
Bigger ? and I fuck with him, half the niggas he with her don't like  
That young nigga 'bout trigger play, and my section Lil Jay like nigga day  
Reiterate I'm 'bout pistol play, anything with my pistol say  
Shoulder deep in this cocaine, but nigga I can hold the weight  
Appraise me, I'm a mill' today  
A mill, and a mill, made a mill today  
Say you wanna do a show, what's the rate?  
Told a nigga fifty with a steel face  
Smoking on kush and I'm drinking on grape's, I feel just like I'm Pimp C  
Say Gucci Mane you a murderer, so you can't get a sponsor like Pepsi  
Say Pepsi, fuck you, cause I fuck with the Coca-Cola anyway  
On check day it's booming, but it's real slow on rent day

I'm so high, baby girl I'm so high  
She get high, your baby girl, she get fucked up  
And he get high, you know that nigga fuck his nose up  
I'm so high, fuck nigga I'm so high

He drinkin' while he drivin'  
Gucci please excuse me , huh, all my goons got jewelry on 'em  
All my niggas booked up, paper they get it on there own  
I don't think you know me homie, I suggest you leave me alone  
I got so much jewelry on, that I think I need a clone  
I pull up to the traffic light, icy as a blood light  
Shinin' like a flash light I might damage ya eye sight  
Gucci got that real ice, don't it look real nice  
I don't want your girlfriend homie but my bitch might

Now straight to the channel shop, that's how she shop  
500 for the flip flops cause they ain't Reebok  
I'm the boy from the block with the very large knots  
Gotta spot in the hood no sofa just pot  
I'm hot, so hot stand next, get shocked  
I got Caucasian neighbors that's just how I rock  
If you talkin' to me tell me somethin' that I wanna know  
If she ain't got no money know you gotta have some doe  
Then she ask me for a drank so I bought a bottle  
She was flexin' really hard, now she flexin' harder  
You a bitch, one more bitch, I only fuck with starters  
So if you ain't a dime piece, ain't no need to bother

I want the money, I smell like a pocket full of hundreds  
A whole bag full of Kush I been buckin' since a youngin'  
I know you need a man right now because you strugglin'  
So if he isn't helpin' then there's no need for discussion  
In Houston Texas I can spend fifty thousand on a Monday  
I got fifty woman with me, fifty more that ain't comin'  
My pocket do the conversation make all the decisions  
I only fuck with bad bitches cause I'm very picky  
He cant buy a drink so he don't deserve ya digits  
I'm polar bear laflare, wrist and ear is very frigged  
My charm big as a midget  
I give yo ass the business

Did wrong so long know didn't know nothin' else  
Then my lima crew was like me a member  
Think every man worth, enemies himself  
Glad as well but I'm mad as hell  
Cause my best friend probably gon' die in jail  
I ain't no lie to tell prolly cry like hell  
If I dwell on it 'cause he got a eighty years

I done rushed and killed ain't proud of that  
Smoke weed took pills sold powder patches  
I'm a solider I understand where the cowards at  
My home boy gone where the flowers at  
Out of money and the work can't bring that back  
If I had one wish, wish momma there  
Could come down now and see me rap  
But she see me now and I believe in that  
Wanna script of that, I ain't going back  
So I put my family on I my back

Bottles in the air put your lighters in the air

Yea I lean on 'em yea I flash on 'em  
Yea I know that's the way you like it huh?  
Yea that's the way you love me huh?  
  
It's alive its alive rounds kill the eyes  
I had to bring the bitch back like Frankenstein  
I push weight but Gucci don't exercise  
I get extra from whipping up extra pies  
I'm in a hood like the mayor 'round election time  
Here's a suggestion don't park your car next to mine  
I'm a star when the light hit I'm supposed to shine  
Your flow is garbage they let me out just in time  
They got a section but none of the hoes are fine  
They need to exit don't let the grind past you by  
I run laps round lames with my shoes untied  
I jump the line walk in and watch the crowd divide  
Still stuck outside its the ugly side  
Look Medusa in the eye and Medusa died  
This top secret shit classified  
Don't blame me swizz was the mastermind  
Cant breath cant breath tone tony brush the time  
I keep my chain moon walking Michael Jackson time  
I keep on buying ice like I lost my mind

Hurry up hurry up Gucci on the news  
They said he walked out the chair rocking stupid jewels  
They tried to find what it do they made that Jew confused  
Too much cash on my hundred falling out my troops  
A yellow wrist bright as piss bitch I'm the shit  
Big Gucci called swizz lets make a hit  
Two things in this world I ain't never seen  
Are you a foreigner nigga I need to help to get me mean?  
I hope you suffocate me totally baby let me breath  
Cause I don't chase nothing but paper bitches chasing me  
Excuse my french I'm Gucci I'm so fucking gutter  
It don't make no sense to switch for none of these motherfuckers

Now I'm back back going like I never never left  
Plus the boy right here I'm fresh to death (whoo)  
Chris Jones on my feet see I can't fall from Suzuki jeeps  
Now I'm jumping off decks  
The word about the haters they can be upset and  
The black card in my back pocket  
The corner sig' is looking like a speeding rocket  
Yeah I'm zooming on a highway  
And you should love me I did it my way

Plus I hit the club with 50k lets keep this shit 100  
I got a couple houses several spouses in my pent house smoking ounces  
Came up selling keys and ounce, half a pound watch golden brown  
My pants sag grams weigh em down, usta catch the train and go downtown  
Just to walk around and window shop now I shut the mall down in every town  
Everytime that I hit the scene fresher then I wanna be  
Cover of the magazines, back of the limousines  
Stacks in my denim jeans, hoes gon remember me  
Fo' fifty eight ship to me from italy, six 12 sittin outside the facilities  
911 Gucci's ice game killing me  
Came along way from drug dealing, waking up rich is a great feeling  
Couple mill stashed for my grandchildren

Every city I make magic, I make money disappear (abra kadabra)  
Cause it's a tragedy how clear these diamonds blingin in my ear  
It's so many wanna marry me, I'm married to the game  
Cocaine put me in position, swagga brought me outta frame  
I need accountants to help me count it, Rolls Royce I mount it  
Corvette painted candy, drop the top that bitch is crowning  
Houses in Zone 6, All my niggas Hustlas, and robbers don't fuck with us  
Niggaz better off fucking with Angel Dust  
I'm racked up like a pool table Stay draped up in Purple Label  
Drink purple drank, smoke purple weed, got a purple car and long paper  
Everyday thank the lord that I wake Everyday live it like it's my last day  
Shine so bright rock stupid ice More karats in my chain then a carrot cake  
Money shout he running out, I'm bustin out can't close the vault  
Aint my fault it's yo fault, nobody stay here this my money house  
Stash house stocked up try fuck shit get chopped up

"(Chorus)  
J's at my door, I got money on the floor (repeat 3x)  
I'm a million dollar nigga on the muthafuckin low  
I got money on the floor (repeat 8x)  
Future in the club, poppin bands on them hoes  
Go ahead Gucci Mane, toss some grands on the floor  
I'm gettin a table dance by a fine ass ho  
Got me coming back, now I'm trying to find this ho  
I got money on the table, choppa on the dresser  
Financially stable, very successful  
Money on the marble(floor)  
Redder than a cardinal  
Bluer Dodger  
Blacker than a ninja  
Itineraries, calenders, baby and agendas  
Boo I'll fuck ya, hit ya when I hit ya  
Text mess(age), fax, e-mail me send a picture  
Gucci Mane, fuck ya girl, go get the pistol  
Gucci Mane fucked the world, and its sister  
Main bitch left me, I didn't even miss her  
Fucked her best friend, she sucked then you kissed her  
Fucked her best friend she sucked me then you kissed her  
Money on the floor, there's more ??? to count  
Got a lot of crack heads trying to get in my house  
This ho say she hungry, put my dick in her mouth  
If she help me hit a lick, then I'm icing her out  
Down south, gold mouth, ya them birds fly south  
Made a half a million dollars in my trap house  
I'm a million dollar man, on the low worth cake  
Every girl I meet fuck on first date  
He on 26's, baby I'm on 8's  
Bart Simpson color diamonds with the red roller skates  
Brazilian, chameleon, reptilian (Air) forces  
????, so the rest of them Jordan's  
If bitches and money was my choices  
Then I choose money and move with bosses  
If bitches and money was my choices  
Then I choose money and move with bosses  
Mojo told me step my game up  
So if I throw up man, shrimp might come up  
Cameleon paint same color the vomit  
???? all in my stomach  
I'm on the look out for a big fine woman  
Who wanna suck dick and can keep me company  
I thug this, love this, never been love sick  
But been frost bit, back back young bitch  
Orange Catalina same color as a Sunkist  
Six 12's beat every time the fuckin drum kick  
Born on the track, so you know its gon go  
I got half a million dollars on this goddamn floor

Come sit on the lap of I-see-E  
And let me tell ya a story or two  
About a punk-ass nigga I knew  
Named Jack, he wasn't that nimble, wasn't that quick  
Jumped over the candlestick and burnt his dick  
Ran up the street cause he was piping hot  
Met a bitch named Jill on the bus stop  
Dropped a line or two, and he had the hoe  
At that type of shit he's a pro  
So Jack and Jill ran up the hill to catch a lil' nap  
Dumb bitch, gave him the claps  
Then he had to go see Dr. Bombay  
Got a shot in the ass, and he was on his way  
To make some money, why not?  
Down on Sesame Street, the dope spot  
There he saw the lady who lived in a shoe  
Sold dope out the front, but in back, marijuana grew  
For the man that was really important  
Who lived down the street in a Air Jordan  
Ride to the fellow Mister Rogers and hoes  
Drove a 500 sittin on Lorenzoes  
He broke out, Little Bo Peep, smoked out  
Saw, her and her friends sellin' sheepskins  
  
Yo yo I got them sheepskins  
Yo, my empty sheepskins

Saw a fight over colors, too  
Red Riding Hood, and Little Boy Blue

Three little pigs in a Coup de Ville

They're fucked up and they want revenge  
Them and Humpty used to be friends  
Now they're enemies cause he's a traitor  
Pulled out the Uzi cruised by and sprayed him  
Cinderella hoeing for the fellas  
And Mister Rogers is gettin' mighty jealous  
Of the cash that the pigs were makin'  
Time for the pigs to get turned to bacon  
Cause Mister Rogers found out quick  
That Humpty Dumpty was blown to bits  
They said that the motherfuckin' wolf was next  
So Mister Rogers better watch his step  
So he let the wolf know  
We're gonna fuck up the pigs, and take their ho  
Cause Cinderella is much too fast  
Before twelve, givin' up ass  
Double barrels all loaded and cocked  
As soon as they show, they gonna get popped  
They bailed down Sesame Street and caught em  
Little Boy Blue is up front givin' orders

But he laughed when I showed him cash  
Had to mash 'fore he called the feds on my ass  
Went to Vegas for the weekend  
Met a hoe down freakin'  
Hey bitch, why you sneakin'?  
Grabbed the paper out her hand  
Am I the man on the front page? (Fuck)  
Same height, same age (click-click)  
Rap gauge, put it down the G-way  
Got my hostage suckin' sausage on the freeway  
She say ""Let's hear the circle K""  
Ran inside and made the niggas all pay  
It's like I hit the Lotto outside Colorado  
Brought it there for his wallet and my bottle  
That's my motto and I gotta warn ya  
Before I'm through, I'm going back to California  
  
Keep my hand on my gun 'cause they got me on the run  
I swear I didn't do what they say I done  
I swear I didn't do what they say I done

[Verse 3]  
My boys you're taught at Illonois  
Set the poise, so I can infiltrate  
All fifty states  
Can't wait till I'm back on my feet  
Switch and shake this bitch in her sleep  
Low key you feds can't see me  
I'm up in D.C. with strike number three  
Clownin', made a little stock to get a little cock  
Now I got niggas bangin' and lootin' rock  
I'm going back to Cali where it's bound with my strikes  
Don't give a fuck who's on the ?marin or the mic  
I should've known when I seen that motherfucker in the lobby  
Looking like he want to rob me (Fuck)  
Federal, don't like no black hetero, sexual, intellectual  
Tried to turn me into a vegetable  
An I'm 'a sue all black and blue  
When I come to- hand cuff (Fuck y'all)  
Big grey bus, scandalous  
'cause they can't stand us  
They get excited and I try to fight it (mama)  
I'm going back to Cali to show, extradited  
  
Keep my hand on my gun 'cause they got me on the run  
I swear I didn't do what they say I done  
I swear I didn't do what they say I done

Hey mama, when y'all send pictures you can't send a Polaroid  
Got to be the regular pictures  
An' they got us in here puttin' in computer chips or something

Saw a chopper with numbers on the bottom

I hit the gas and I mashed past Inglewood  
I think I drove through every single hood  
South Central, Compton and Watts

Metal flake green on D's I look suspicious  
You know that I'm running

Fuck, I see it coming  
Is it a bird? Yup  
Is it a plane? No  
I hit me a right on El Segundo  
Wanted to holla, had to ditch the Impala  
Let's see if they would folla  
Me, hit a fence, hit a fence, and another  
met me a baby pitbull and his mother  
Ran up in some peoples house and looked out of the window  
I wish it was my ten-four  
had to pull a strap on a fool named Louis the Third  
'cause I'm getting chased by the ghetto bird  
  
""Just put his hat, ehrrr,  
he combed his hair and then put his hat back on.  
he's acting nonchalant up there in that cockpit, going 115  
miles an hour, with the police chasing him.  
they're not gonna be  
real happy when they catch up with him, no matter what, the eh  
They hate, they hate a bigmouth even worse.""  
  
Officer Bird's on his way, and I don't want to see him  
could you please give me the keys to the B.M.?  
See, I didn't want to gank you  
but don't make me bank you, thank you  
Tried to get yo the hood, and you might guess  
that a fool like me woulda shot Cyrus  
Incognito, Ghetto Eagle  
Saying, ""Fuck, where did he go?""  
I bust me a left from Rubellon. Park  
The 735 and I'm bailin'  
Went to my homegirl's house and got a hug man,  
She helped me run like Harriet Tubman  
Looked out the window by the black bed  
I saw the pigs and the four on a flatbed  
Then the light from the bird hit me in the face  
I close the blinds cause I didn't want to catch a case  
All that night, I heard the bird circle  
while I was eating fish and watching Urkel  
She said I could sleep on the couch  
By two A.M. I was digging her out  
Fuck the ghetto bird  
  
""Which way is he going now?""  
""Ok, now, now he's, he's actually southbound, on a service street

One on the peddles the other on the handle bars (what)

As I enter I see you  
He said the bullet hit a nerve that was vital  
I said I can't move my legs he said don't try to

If I can sell you the American dream,  
I can sell you anything  
  
Look at this maggot, with a stimulus package  
I can give a fuck about a Dow Jones average  
What the fuck you do when your paycheck is average?  
Law abiding citizen turn into a savage,  
Got to feed the children, got to feed the habit  
Fell into a rabbit hole, chasing that rabbit  
Now I'm in wonderland feeling like the Son of Sam  
I'm at your west coast branch, gun in hand  
I'ma feel like superman,  
Walk by the teller, better call the trooper, man  
It's the revenge of the lambs,  
""big bad wolf, we're sick of these scams""  
Sick of these plans, sick of this dance  
Walk into his office took the nine out my pants  
You're not a man, you're a serpent  
Then I pray to God nigga nine get to workin'  
  
I never get the working  
You know I heard they hood robbin',  
Your money or your life and there ain't no stoppin' 'em,  
I never get the working  
You know I heard they hood robbin',

Uh, drug dealer M.D.  
Doctor feel good, give you what you need  
In California, prescribe that weed  
Oxycontin and codeine  
Turn your grand mama into a fiend  
And see the cyanide first hit ain't free  
I know you bout to die, but let me see your I.D.  
I know you bout to lie, but can you pay this fee?  
If you can't pay, then please have a seat  
You can't see a doctor but you could see a priest  
We can't save your life until we get some insurance  
Your premium is paid, add that insurance  
I hope you got endurance,  
They got me on hold and I'm under they influence  
Nurse high as a kite,  
In charge with my life,  
And everything is lost,  
Without blue cross  
  
You know I heard they hood robbin',  
Your money or your life and there ain't no stoppin' 'em,

"Once upon a time in the projects, yo  
I damn near had to wreck a ho  
I knocked on the door - ""who is it?""  
It's ice cube, come to pay a little visit to ya  
And what's up with the niggas in the parking lot  
She said fuck em, cause they get sparked alot  
I sat on the couch but it wasn't stable  
And then I put my nikes on the coffee table  
Her brother came in he's into gangbangin'  
Cause he walked up and said ""what set you claimin""  
I don't bang I write the good rhymes  
The whole scenery reminded me of good times  
I don't like to feel that I'm put in a rut  
By a young nigga that needs to pull his pants up  
He threw up a set and then he was gone  
I'm thinkin' to myself, won't this bitch bring her ass on  
Her mother came in with a joint in her mouth  
And fired up the sess it was sess no doubt  
She said please excuse my house and all that  
I said yeah cause I was buzzed from the contact  
Lookin' at a fucked up black and white  
Her mom's bitchin' cause the county check wasn't right  
She had another brother that was three years old  
And had a bad case of the runny nose  
He asked me who I was then I had to pause  
It smelled like he took a shit in his little drawers  
I saw her sister that needs get her ass kicked  
Only thirteen and already pregnant  
I grabbed the forty out the bag and took a swig  
Cause I was getting overwhelmed by bebe kids  
They were runnin and playin and cursin and yellin  
And tellin and look at this young punk bailin  
I heard a knock on the door without the password  
And her mom's got the 12 guage mossberg  
The nigga said ""yo, what's for sale""  
And the bitch came out with a bag of ya-yo  
She made the drop and got the 20 dollars  
From a smoked out fool with ring around the collar  
The girl I was waiting for came out  
I said bitch I didn't know this was a crack house  
I got my coat and suddenly  
The cop busted in and had a mac-10 pointed to my dome  
And I said to myself once again it's on  
He threw me on the carpet and wasn't cuttin no slack  
Jumped on my head and put his knee in my back  
First he tried to slap me up, wrap me up, rough me up  
They couldn't do it so they cuffed me up  
I said fuck how much abuse can a nigga take  
Hey yo officer you're making a big mistake  
Since I had on a shirt that said I was dope  
He thought I was selling base and couldn't hear my case  
He said get out my face and musta had a grudge  
His reply tell that bullshit to the judge  
The girl I was with wasn't sayin nothin  
I said aiyyo bitch you better tell em somethin  
She started draggin and all of a sudden  
We all got tossed in the patty wagon  
Now I beat the rap but that ain't the point  
I had a warrant so I spent 2 weeks in the joint  
Now the story you heard has one little object

Hit you wit' these things that I'm holding  
Who wanna squab with the frozen?  
Now, who wanna battle with the chosen?  
You nigga's lotion  
I'm no emotion  
I'm shrapnel from the explosion  
Hit you in the face while you posing  
  
High as Jimmy Hendricks  
I lined up ten dicks and took out appendix  
So go get forensics  
Let 'em know I'm Geronimo  
Till it's my time to go  
You better find your ho  
Get your babies and your mama  
And move to Guantanamo  
Doubt my skills  
I'm payin' my bills  
I'm up in the hills  
You niggas are kills  
Even though I'm on a fucked up label  
You bitches know what I can bring to the table  
  
[Chorus]  
  
This right here - it's payback  
From way back  
I don't play that  
I don't play that  
I don't play that  
I don't play that  
  
I like bitches like you  
5'2"", wearing light blue  
The freak get high too  
With a fly dude  
Not a Erika Badu  
That's looking for an ""I do""  
Now, what can I buy you  
Just to try you?  
Need another bitch to lie to  
Need another bitch in my coupe  
Oh, please can I trouble you  
For a double scoop  
  
A nigga need some T and A  
Now you can get dick, but you can't get no DNA  
I heard you was a big freak  
(Can I hang?)  
Bitch, look down - I got some big feet  
I like Mike and Ike's  
I like watchin' dikes  
I like goin' to fights  
I like earnin' my stripes  
In the book of life  
There's only two women  
Big ol' good ones  
And good ol' big ones

"You can't fuck with the criminal rapping over gangsta shit  
First I load the clip and then I make the hit  
I know some y'all can't fade this  
Lench Mob niggas are the craziest  
So you and your boys are ass out  
When I'm rollin' in a seven deuce glass house  
The Mob ain't nothing but a menace  
When we get the motherfucking dog in us  
Playing them old beats  
I'm pouring out some of my beer for my homies  
Ready to peel your cap  
You can't believe ""Faces of Death"" on wax  
Some say the Mob ain't positive  
Man fuck that shit cause I gots to live  
How I live and you could either give a fuck punk  
Yo or get your ass bucked  
Some rappers are heaven-sent  
But Self-Destruction don't pay the fucking rent  
So you can either sell dope or get your ass a job  
I'd rather roll it wit the Lench Mob  
  
To be down with the Mob is simple  
Mind your own you want a spot find your own  
And take mine if you're badder than the strong man  
I do the right thing I do the wrong thing  
Do anything cause I ain't faking the scene  
It's all about how much bacon you bring  
And if you see something from the gat I will stuff it  
Yo you ain't seen nothing  
Cause if you testify you're living blind  
Cause in the city you live and let die  
Rolling with the fools One Time can't beat  
On my knees in the street interlock my hands and feet  
He said ""I know you"" I said ""you might  
My name is Ice Cube I did a song you didn't like""  
So he soaked me up like Bounty  
Had to do a week in the county  
A piece of cake it was just like a party  
Cause in the county you know everybody  
No I didn't kill or steal or rob  
Locked up for what cause I'm rollin wit the Lench Mob  
  
If you know a female that's rollin with the Lench Mob  
Watch your step cause the gat is kept  
In the purse like my homegirl Yo-Yo  
You gotta be down and you can't be a hoe no  
Cause if you are I'll be the first one to bust you out  
After my crew I'll be the first one to rush you out  
Get the picture or bitch  
You'll get the eighty-six  
If she want to try and mix  
Business and pleasure make up your own mind  
You gotta be a hoe on your own time  
Don't sleep cause even on a solo creep  
Yo the Mob is still deep  
And we'll play ya just like a nit-wit  
You thought you got with the crew you can't get with  
So get the noose ready for the lynching  
Now 235 is what I'm benching  
But nowadays it's still not enough  
I got something guaranteed to stop the bum rush  
Give me the gat, step back, and watch me do the job  
Rolling with the motherfucking Lench Mob

Face down, paralyzed from the waist down  
I'm a buckin' clown, but don't fuck around  
Doin' movies now, but I'll lay you down  
South Central style, pull them thangs out  
Don't make a millionaire have to send you there  
You know the story of the tortoise nigga and the hare  
Nigga run nigga run never get there  
I'ma walk, fuck a bitch when I get there  
Nigga this a marathon, ask Farrakhan  
Fuck the cemetery that I'm buried on (fuck 'em)  
The blood of Ice Cube got to carry on (forever)  
Forever what the fuck are they yellin'?

Who the fuck got more than an acre?  
In Los Angeles I got to have paper  
I'm a nigga, don't talk to my neighbors  
Straight asshole, always up in Vegas (yay yay)  
Lay it out for these niggas to follow  
Get the point, but these points is hollow  
Now this here, is hard to swallow  
But if you do it's like hittin' the lotto  
Little nigga with big bravado  
Hit the throttle niggas hit the bottle  
Can give a fuck if they life is hollow  
Where the fuck was you, when I rocked the Apollo, bitch?  
  
Ay, who put this thing together? Me, that's who  
Who I trust? Who I trust? me, thats who!  
  
Nigga nigga nigga, can't you see  
Somehow your words incarcerate me  
Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee  
Lock me up in my prime, Muhammad Ali  
Get out whoop yo' ass like Muhammad Ali  
Rumble in the Jungle, nigga don't play Dumbo  
In the hood nigga known as Columbo  
Get the people on the phone, tell the jumble  
Spit fluid and swear he didn't do it  
Got my bottom bitch locked up with Martha Stewart  
She say she had the hoe cookin' deep dish  
She say Martha fuckin' cook fish and eat fish  
Westside y'all niggas got to peep this  
That's your weakness, can't keep a secret  
Don't say shit, boy that's basic  
They want to send a nigga back to the slave ship  
Stop snitchin  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You can have whatever you choose  
But out here, it's don'ts and do's  
So after we finish this mission  
Stop snitchin', nigga stop snitchin'  
  
OK, OK

"I was told cause I didn't witness the whole act  
In and out was the movement of the bozack  
It was hot and sweaty and lots of pushin  
Then the nut came gushin  
And it was hell tryin to bail to the ovary  
With nothin' but the Lord lookin' over me  
I was white with a tail  
But when I reached the finish line young black male!  
One cell made two and two cells made fo'  
And so on so now I'm a embryo  
Then I got a hunch  
That I'ma be on lock down, for nine months  
Chillin', with my mother to guide me  
And nothin' but a stomach to hide me  
From all that worry and bullshit  
Nine months later, I elbow pull and kick  
Cause my time is up and I don't care  
With one big push, I'm outta there  
June 15th, it's just my luck  
In 1969, a nigga is the product  
  
""Ghetto ass nigga, you ain't shit,  
And you ain't gon' never be shit!""  
  
I learned how to walk and talk and all that  
They put me in school, but it don't matter  
Cause I'm sittin' in history  
Learnin' bout a sucker, who didn't give a fuck about me  
They try to shape us  
But I know Uncle Sam is a motherfuckin' rapist  
So I stopped payin' attention  
Ice Cube, headed, straight to detention  
Fuck that shit, I roam the hallways  
I'm sent home and I don't got all A's  
A high school dropout  
My father had beef so I tried to knock pops out  
But I got tossed, he's the boss  
I'm out of there and mad cause I lost  
Now bein' on my own is a factor  
So I become, the neighborhood jacker  
Gimme your car, run your jewels  
Makin' a livin' robbin' fools  
And if I let my nine rang out  
You know, it'll make your brains hang out  
So what's your fate?  
Am I the nigga you love, or the one you love to hate?  
The wrong answer is said, the nigga fled  
I pump lead, now he's in a puddle of red  
And if you got a buck, you're shit out of luck  
Stuck up by the motherfuckin' product  
  
""Uh-uh motherfucker you gots to get a job  
If you want to stay in my motherfuckin' house""  
  
""Many young men reject the traditional values  
That are important to their parents.  
Church, school and family  
Have been replaced by street, turf, and gang.""  
  
Twenty-one now, and paid in full  
Feelin' bad, from all the shit I pulled  
On people back in the day  
Plus, I got a little baby on the way  
So I'm tryin' to go straight  
I'm with my baby's momma, out on a date  
Til the punk ass cops ran my plate  
Now I'm on a bus upstate  
  
""Oh, the young nigga done caught a case!""  
""Sittin' in the mess hall, sayin' my grace""  
  
Sent to a concrete hoe-house

Livin' in a five by seven  
Dear baby, your man's gettin' worn out  
Of seein' young boys gettin' they assholes torn out  
And then he got shanked with a spoon  
And he was 'sposed to get out soon  
Is it my fault, he was caught in production  
Where a young black life means nothin'  
Just because, I didn't want to learn your grammar  
You say I'm better off in the slammer  
And it's drivin' me batty  
Cause my little boy, is missin' daddy  
I'm ashamed, but the fact is  
I wish pops let me off on the mattress  
Or should I just hang from the top bunk

Niggaz get killed, and then filled with embalming fluid

Pull out the tec and I reckon you'll get murdered in a second  
Bang with the nine, boom with the pow  
Motherfuckers are fallin' and crawlin' on the ground  
Snitches get stitches, bitches that act snotty

You ain't gonna have a chance to clown no more

Talk right and I'll talk right back

Could have popped you off, one dead cop

I show a little mercy cause I'm civilized  
Looking through a nigga's eyes at a much bigger prize  
But when I saw Rodney it got me so hot  
Made me wanna go out and pop me a cop

Here comes the Grand Dragon, in the motherfucking patty wagon  
Try to play me like a trick  
Sometimes you act like a dick, Mr. Nightstick  
Back then, I used to throw my Mack-10  
But nowadays you got the black skin  
Back then you don't like the voice of a nigga named Ice  
But you ain't gonna take my life  
  
You man let's get an understanding  
I know that your job is demanding  
But I only got me one life to live  
You only got about six shots to give  
And I got a big AK with a 50-round clip  
So why should we trip?  
You ain't gonna punk me, so what you trying for?  
Ain't no job worth dying for, is it?  
Might pay a visit to Petey Wheatstraw  
When you stop me on the shore, officer of the law  
And if I did something wrong, you can lock me up  
Never never never gonna sock me up  
So next time you have the urge, all of the sudden  
To fuck with a nigga for nothing  
Think about me, a brother that's 23  
I got a son and a J-O-B

Back in LA, and I'm bailin' in the dough  
Everybody, now I gotta start from scratch

What you tell me?  
No it ain't crack, and everybody's jackin' for a coupe  
'cause, they sent in the troops  
Even tho I got muscle, that ain't my hustle  
Takin' niggas shit in a tussle  
No skills to pay the bills  
Takin' 'bout education to battle inflation  
No college degree, just a dumb ass G  
(Yeah you Nigga, who me?)  
I got a baby on the way, damn it's a mess  
Have you ever been convicted of a felony? Yes  
Took some advice from my Uncle Fester  
All dressed up in polyester  
Welcome to McDonald's may I please help you?  
Shit, what can I do?

"Fucking around in a crap game  
Niggas think I'm soft cause now I'm in the rap game  
And I don't hang out as much  
Bang out dope cuts  
Standing on stage and I'm grabbing my nuts  
But when it comes to getting in a circle  
I'm hitting sevens turning broke niggas purple  
Looking for Little Joe and the dumb nigga scream and choke  
When deuce deuce hit the floor yo  
Now which of ya want to fade the twenty?  
I'm turnin your fat pockets skinny  
Ah yeah I'm shaking the ivory  
And boom it's like they die for me  
Fool you can get loud, get mad, hit the joint  
But don't forget my point  
There it is yo  
I put my Nike on the bet so it won't slide  
Money gone cause I'm never hitting deuce-five  
I'm never hitting four-trey no way  
You want to leave but come on hoe stay  
Nigga see but that'll work  
Poppa needs brand-new shoes and a sweatshirt  
Fool you can't even fuck with that  
And now that I'm winning I gots to get my gat  
Cause I see your homies starting to look  
And broke motherfuckers they make the best crooks  
And I'm feeling like a baller  
Bucking fools now the circles getting smaller  
Now you want to go and scheme  
Punk niggas like you just love to triple-team  
So I pick up my money and start walking  
Cause now I let the gat start talking  
Now since ya'll lost you want to go out like a sucker  
Take that motherfucker

Who's the mack? is it some brother in a big hat  
Thinking he can get any bitch with a good rap?  
Rolling in a fucked up Lincoln  
Leaning to the side So it looks like he's sinking  
Into that leopard interior  
This nigga thinks every girl's inferior  
To his tongue get a dumb bitch sprung  
As she's selling more butt  
Don't even get a cut of the money  
His name is Sonny  
And he know the play  
And hope to god that he don't find a runaway  
That's looking to become a star  
He'll have your ass in and out of every car  
With every on and Rick, sucking every john's dick  
Come short of the money, get your ass kicked  
You don't like it but you still call him hunk  
Last night the nigga put yo' ass in the trunk  
You want to leave but Sonny started talking fast  
And it make you want to go and sell more ass  
He's getting rich, you his bitch and it's like that  
Now ask yourself  
Who's the mack?  
Who's the mack?  
  
It is that fool that want to pump the gas  
Give you a sad story and you give him cash?  
He starts macking and macking and you sucking  
Quick to say I'm down on my luck  
And you give a dollar or a quarter and he's on his way  
Then you see his sorry ass the next day  
Are you the one getting played like a sucker?  
Or do you say, ""Get a job, motherfucker""?  
Every day, the story gets better  
He's wearing dirty pants and a funky-assed sweater  
He claims he wants to get something to eat  
But every day you find yourself getting beat  
He gets your money and you run across the street don't look both ways  
'cause he's in a daze  
And almost get his ass hit for the crack  
Now ask yourself  
Who's the mack?  
Who's the Mack?  
  
Is it that nigga in that club asking  
Have you ever been in a hot tub?  
I know the game so I watch it unfold  
When I see the boy pinned to your earlobe  
He's talking shit and you crack a smile  
When he tell you that he can go buck wild  
For a girl like you and make it feel good  
You know it's drama but it sound real good  
He started dragging and hopefully he can start tagging  
The pussy so he can keep bragging  
He say, ""I'm 'a leave baby, can you go with me?""  
The pussy so he can keep bragging  
You want to do it but you feeling like a H-O-E  
You grab his hand, you leave and it's over  
'Cause the nigga ain't nothing but a rover  
Ya knew the game and you still ended up on your back  
Now ask yourself  
Who's the Mack?  
Macking is the game and everybody's playing  
And as long as you believe what they saying  
Consider the a M.A.C.K. and with no delay  
They are gonna get all the play  
But when it comes to me, save the drama for your momma  
It's Ice Cube and you know that I'm a  
Mack in my own right  
When it comes to rhyme and rap  
'cause all I do is kick facts  
Unlike Iceberg Slimm  
And all of them be claimin' be P.I.M.P.  
No, I'm not going out that way  
I'm just a straight up N I double G A  
Next time you get over on a fool  
And you did the shit like real smooth  
Thank Ice Cube for giving up the facts  
And ask yourself

"Now the taste of alcohol is filling up my bladder  
What's the date and time it don't matter  
Had a pocket full of phone numbers I was trying to sort  
To make a long story short  
Ran into this girl named Carla  
Knew her from the back seat of my homie's Impala  
She said what's up yeah what's the deal  
Check the hairdo of course it ain't real  
Then I looked down she was fat in the front  
I asked how long, well about seven months  
Oh how time flies when you're having fun  
She said yeah but the damage is done  
Where you been, on a little vacation  
Oh by the way congratulations  
Who's the lucky man? I don't have a clue  
Then she said the lucky man is you  
I dropped my brew  
And everything looked fuzzy  
Not a baby by you the neighborhood hussy  
She said yeah remember that date  
I thought back and tried to calculate  
Then I said damn are you sure it's mine  
Cause I know you been tossed plenty of times  
She said that day no I wasn't whoring  
Your ass is mine that's when the sweat started pouring  
Cause all I saw was Ice Cube in court  
Paying a gang on child support  
Then I thought deep about giving up the money  
What I need to do is kick the bitch in the tummy  
Naw cause then I'd really get faded  
That's murder one cause it was premeditated  
So what I'm a do  
I don't have a clue  
How many months left damn only two  
I'm gettin' faded  
  
No cigar, G  
Ay yo homey man I'm getting faded  
  
It's crazy cause before I could sleep with her  
I had to duck and dodge and try to creep with her  
See the booty and the front was all in place  
But the girl had the pitbull face  
So we ran jumped drove swam crawled hid  
Oh lord god forbid  
My homies see me at the motel  
Cause those fools would love to just go tell  
Everybody in the hood that knows your rep  
So jump in the back seat and quiet is kept  
And hold your big fat butt steady  
Cause yo hoe I got the paper bag ready  
She started moaning and gobbling like a turkey  
I knocked the boots from here to Albuquerque  
I dropped her off man and I'm knowing  
That I'm a hate myself in the morning  
I got drunk to help me forget  
Yo another day another hit shit  
I'm gettin' faded  
  
Ay yo you know what time it is  
  
Nine months later she's ready to drop the load  
And everybody in the hood already knows  
It's supposed to be mine so they laughing at me  
You know Ice Cube can't be having that G  
I'm thinking to myself why did I bang her  
Now I'm in the closet looking for the hanger  
JD and Jinx and T-Bone won't let up they won't shut up  
I'm gettin' fed up bitch  
Cause I know you're tryin' to break me  
But if I find out your tryin' to fake me  
I'm a buff that duff for a hoot  
Beat ya down and leave a crown or two  
That night she went into labor  
And the shit is getting kinda major  
The baby came out damn it was a lifesaver  
Looking like my next-door neighbor  
She said it was mine that was her best guess  
But let's check the results of the blood test  
I started smiling yeah cause it read negative  
Damn why did I let her live  
After that I should've got the gat  
And bust and rushed and illed and peeled the cap  
But no I just told the hoe who laid me  
Excuse me bitch it's a switch  
You can't fade me  
  
Naw baby not this way  
Yo you ain't playing Ice Cube out like no booger  
I don't fall for the okey-doke  
And before I fall for the okey-doke  
I let the pistol smoke  
Now sing it  
Yeah baby you can't fade me

Didn't panic but I still looked cracked out

Coughin' up blood on my hands and knees

Yo, I didn't do a thing  
Didn't want to go out like my man Rodney King  
Still got gaffled  
Internal bleeding as the bullet starts to travel

Its filled to the rim like the county jail day room  
Nobody gettin' help

The hospital move slow  
Now I'm laid out  
People steppin' over me to get closer to the tv  
Just like a piece of dog shit  
Now will I die on this nappy ass carpet  
One hour done passed  
Done watched two episodes of MASH  
And when I'm almost through  
They call my name and put me on ICU  
Halfway dead  
No respect and handcuffed to the bed  
Now the trauma starts  
'Cause the bullet must be just a hair from my heart  
So I begin the ass kissin'  
Just to get looked at by an overworked physician  
Got the chills, but my temperatures 103  
Only got a band-aid and an IV  
That's when I start cussin'  
Police steady askin' me who did the bustin'  
  
Why oh why can't I get help

I just shook my head and wondered who the fuck you are  
  
Are you a grown crack baby born in the '80s?  
Are you a grown crack baby born in the '80s?  
Are you a grown crack baby born in the '80s?  
Are you the motherfucker that broke in my Mercedes?  
  
You've got to be a crack baby, turn into a grown-up  
Sharp as a bowling ball, brain like a doughnut  
My daddy told me that the early bird get the worm  
He told me that the early dope fiend get the sherm  
Three AM, see you ridin' on that bicycle  
Old motherfucker, what you doin' on that tricycle?  
You's a cold motherfucker like a icicle  
With your grandmama purse tryin' to buy a nickel  
I should kick ya ass just because she can't do it  
Cause all you do is talk shit and you drink fluid  
You say ""Yeah man, you better get used to it""  
They say God is perfect, and I say he blew it  
  
Are you a grown crack baby born in the '80s?  
Are you a grown crack baby born in the '80s?

"There's a new girl on my street  
And I might introduce her to mack me  
Told my homeboy I was scoping hoping  
To crack them legs wide open  
Ready to break that banging ass  
Get it with the shad  
Take a bath in her mouth yeah  
Better keep the Trojan  
And if the sex was good still be the whole frame  
Fucked around and told my plan to the man  
Sitting next to the god damn men  
How was I to know son  
That the nigg' blow with one and told the 4-1-1  
With a big fat grand  
Talking 'bout all the whores that I ran up in  
Broke a nigga plan like dishes  
'cause now the bitch is getting suspicious  
She know I fuck whores outta habit  
Who framed Cube, motherfuck Roger Rabbit!  
'cause I couldn't have and got stabbed in the back  
By a black ass dirty mack

And if you didn't know it's like that  
I got a big fat gat for the dirty mack  
Yeah nigga didn't you know it was like that  
I got a big fat gat for the dirty mack  
  
There goes the bill-board pull it  
And see up I'm still number one with the bullet  
what the fuck do I sing?  
It looks like the Predator  
it's gettin' dissed by the editor  
Looked up and hell of white for caper  
It's to lynch a nigga on paper  
But I'm much too black for the god damn cracker  
Huh! Dirty Macker  
Even the Guardian Angel got mental  
But never seen their ass walking past South Central  
Little super hair oh don't lemme catcha  
I fuck around and wetcha  
Try to dirty mack me out  
Try to take food out my kids mouth  
You're looking at my people are stronger than your evil  
All you ask where they got the hip hop  
At the dope the 187 taxi on your toe  
So act like you know  
That nigga that's known to jack  
Devils in little red hats  
Motherfuckin' dirty macks!

Don't come to an O.G., with that 'he said she said'  
Bitch, hit the freeway, dirty mack's get tossed  
'cause I fuck around, and jump your ass like Kris Kross  
Just might blast, snake in the grass  
Gotta shake up the ass  
Found at a trunk of funk  
Tall and stiff as a philly blunt  
What more do you want you unfucked up the plot  
And deserve just what you got  
'cause I'm hotter than tabasco  
You little ass hole  
Mow I gotta do you like grass chow  
PKO now you see they flow on cannabis  
Cause you scandalous  
Don't know who the man is  
Ice Cube a jack  
The white ass Dirt Mack  
  
And if you didn't know it's like that  
I got a big fat gat for the dirty mack  
Yo Savage didn't you know it was like that

Puff-puff-pass, we out on Ave.

I've been doin' good, they been doin' bad  
When I see you walk by, I'm pursuin' that  
But never chase it, my game is so basic  
As soon as I lace it - baby, wanna taste it?  
Just face it, put me to the test  
Ice Cube would ace it, I'm built for success  
Fuck a Rock-star! We wanna party like a Rap Star  
In the club, in the house, or the backyard (Yay-yay!)  
You make it rain with ones, I make it rain with hun's

They put away they crucifix

You know how it's done  
Sounds bumpin  
Ain't that somethin'?  
Jumped on the 110  
She's flyin' in the Blazer

But I ain't gonna chase her

So when you want to get together?  
Cause you know a nigga like me  
Is down for whatever

When I was little I didn't want to be like Mike  
I wanted to be like Ike  
Cause  
Papa Was A Rolling Stone in the sixties  
And he liked green like Bill Bixby  
Told me that my best friend was a ten and a twenty  
Pokets never skinny  
Played let's get it on in the living room  
And hwne he gets drunk you better give him room  
Cause he'll turn the party out sayin', ""This is my motherfuckin' house""  
And y'all gots to go  
Through the door  
And if you can't find the door  
He'll help you with the four-four  
Talkin' much shit on the grass  
And straight down to blast  
I'm still in my p.j.'s  
He's in a turtleneck sweater  
And we down for whatever  
  
And I'm down  
Solid Pro is down for whatever  
The Don Jaguar is down for whatever  
And it don't seem to stop  
  
Now  
I don't talk a lot of shit  
But when it's time to get busy with these hos, let's go  
Cause I'd rather see a skinhead dead  
Then my niggas wearin' blue or red  
Cause I got the gift  
To hit these hos swift  
And I'm smellin' like a fifth  
Of somethin'  
Yeah, that's right  
I'm standin' in the store  
Koreans  
Act so nice  
Cause I got potentials to blow up a Winchells  
Doughnut  
And you know what?  
I'm Cool Like That like Digable Planets  
But don't take a nigga for granted  
Cause whether it's a verdict of the L.A. four  
You just don't know  
That this rappin'-ass nigga will change with the weather  
And be down for whatever  
  
And I'm down  
Creep.  
And I'm down for whatever

And I will never dance for you trick-ass niggas

Strung on pretension, they fall for you at first sight  
You know their business, you think it's a bore  
They make you restless, it's nothin' you ain't seen before  
Get around town, spend your time on the run  
You never let down, say you do it for fun  
Never miss a play, though you make quite a few  
You give it all away - everybody wants you  
  
You crave attention, you can never say ""no""  
Throw your affections any way the wind blows  
You always make it, you're on top of the scene  
You sell the copy like the cover of a magazine  
Puttin' on the eyes 'til there's nobody else  
You never realize what you do to yourself  
The things that they see make the daily reviews  
You never get free - everybody wants you  
  
Everybody knows you  
Everybody snows you  
Everybody needs you, leads you, bleeds you  
  
Nights of confusion and impossible dreams  
Days at the mirror, patchin' up around the seams  
You got your glory, you paid for it all  
You take your pension in loneliness and alcohol  
Say goodbye to conventional ways  
You can't escape the hours, you lose track of the days  
The more you understand, seems the more like you do  
You never get away - everybody wants you

Verse one:  
I want to kill him 'cause he tried to play me like a trick,  
But you see, I'm the wrong nigga to fuck wit.  
I got the A to the motherfucking K, and it's ready to rip,  
(slot them my banana clip)  
And I'm looking,  
Is he in Watts, Oakland, Philly or Brooklyn?  
It seems like he got the whole country behind him,  
So it's sort of hard to find him.  
But when I do, gotta put my gat in his mouth,  
Punk, seventeen rounds make his brains hang out.  
'Cause the shit he did was on comfort,  
Tried fuck a brother up the Ave like a small whore.  
And that shit ain't fly,  
So now I'm setting up the ultimate drive-by.  
And when you hear this shit,  
It makes the world say damn, I want to kill Sam.  
  
""momma, some man at the front door""  
""uhm hi, I've got reasons to believe that someone in this household  
Has just turned eighteen, am I correct?""  
  
This is why I want to kill the punk,  
'cause he tried to take a motherfucking chunk of the funk.  
He came to my house, I let 'em bail in,  
'cause he said he was down with the L.M.  
He gave up a little death,  
Then turned around, and pulled out a gat.  
I knew it was a caper,  
I said: ""please don't kill my mother"", so he raped her.  
Tied me up, took me outside,  
And I was thrown in a big truck.  
And it was packed like sardines,  
Pull of niggers who fell for the same scheme.  
Took us to a place and made us work,  
All day and we couldn't have shit to say.  
? up the families forever,  
Until this day black folks can't stick together,  
And it's I, broke us down, made us pray to his God.  
And when I think about it,  
It makes me say damn, I want to kill Sam.  
  
Now in '91, they want to tax me,  
I remember the son of a bitch used to axe me.  
And hang me by a ? till my neck snapped,  
Now the sneaky motherfucker wants to ban rap.  
And put me on the dirt or concrete,  
But God can see through a white cheek.  
'Cause you're the devil in drag,  
You can burn your cross while I burn your flag.  
Try to give me the HIV,  
So I can stop making babies like me.  
And you're giving dope to my people Chuck,  
Just wait till we get over that, huh.  
'Cause your ass is grass 'cause I'm a blast,  
Can't bury rap, like your buried jazz.  
'Cause we stop being whores, stop doing floors,  
So bitch you can fight your own wars.  
So if you see a man in red, white and blue,  
Getting chased by The Lench Mob crew.  
It's a man who deserves to buckle,  
I want to kill Sam 'cause he ain't my motherfucking uncle.

So take a piece of the pole and be happy

Without us your hand would be your best friend  
So give us credit like you know you should  
If I don't look good you don't look good  
  
I doubt it baby cause we're still most dominant  
  
But you don't know how funky that I can get  
  
This is a man's world thank you very much  
  
But it wouldn't be a damn thing without a woman's touch  
  
Man women I put a lot of fear in em  
Cause I had it up to here with em  
Drink a beer with em  
No way cause I can only deal with em about an hour every day  
Yeah if you know what I mean baby  
  
Well I guess now that I think about it I think maybe  
If you was more of a man instead of faking it  
Women deserve the credit when they're making it  
  
Yeah so what's the problem  
  
Well I think we solved it  
I know they know the best male from who's doggin it  
  
Yeah I admit you can flow  
  
Well that's true  
  
But you see I'm a pro with the bank too  
  
Yeah I can see you got it good  
  
Oh that I know  
  
But you see you're not better than Yo-Yo  
The brand-new intelligent black lady  
  
You're kinda dope but you still can't fade me  
  
So what up then  
  
Girl what you tryin to do  
  
To prove a black woman like me can bring the funk through  
  
This is a man's world thank you very much  
  
But it wouldn't be a damn thing without a woman's touch  
  
Or a big butt...

"The West-coast Warlord,  
The Grand Wizard,  
Ice Cube,  
Motherfuckers head so big they call him jack in the box  
  
[Verse 1]  
I'm a superhero, like Lou Ferrigno,  
Made by the Nero, look like a zero,  
Shine the spotlight, this is my night,  
Get your cameras ready, let it rain confetti,  
I'm a champion, I do what can't be done,  
In the real league nerd, not the fantasy one  
Throw your hands up, you can cheer for your boy,  
When I hit the stage get an ear full of noise,  
When I bring the noise from here to Illinois,  
Motherfuckers love when I do what it does,  
A all-star, superstar entertainer,  
World class, first ballot hall-of-famer,  
Some rappers claim that they got a heart full of anger,  
How when your lyrics weren't written by a stranger,  
Fool I'm the greatest, you just the latest,  
I'm loved by your grand mama, and your baby  
  
[Chorus]  
See my head is so big they call me jack in the box,  
You can't impress me, so fuck what you got,  
I said my head is so big they call me jack in the box,  
Don't talk about money cause I'm stacking a lot,  
  
[Bridge]  
Shine that light on me, put that light on me,  
Cause I was sent to the world, by G-O-D,  
Shine that light on me, put that light on me,  
Cause I was sent to the world, by G-O-D,  
  
[Verse 2]  
I was a born loser, I was a born sinner,  
Now I am a winner, in a convincing sinner,  
I got to take a bow, cause I still wonder how,  
The system didn't get me when I was a juvenile,  
Just think if I had got locked up,  
No Boyz in da Hood thanks to America,  
No Eazy, NWA, no 'Friday',  
Don't let your motherfucking talent go to waste,  
Don't catch a case cause these people got a place,  
To throw your life away and take you right out the waste,  
Throw your hands up, you got to man up,  
I had to show the world, what I was made of,  
What you say Blood, I was a slad cause,  
Now I'm V.I.P., up in Vegas,  
I'm up in Nike-town, so how you like me now,  
See the whole industry had to bite my style,  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Bridge]  
  
Now mama don't be mad I got to show my ass,  
And thanks these motherfuckers for my past,  
I got to let them know I never break like glass,  
What you looking at it's top notch world class,  
  
Mama don't be mad I got to show my ass,  
And thanks these motherfuckers for my past,  
I got to let them know I never break like glass,

That's the name of the suckers I done ganked  
I get away from a copper  
Drop a dime, I'll break you off somethin proper  
With the L-E-N-see-H-M-O-be  
T-Bone and that's J.D.  
And here's how we'll greet ya  
Stop fool, come off that beat ya  
Feel dumb cause you're caught in the dark  
(ya lil nuttin ass mark)  
Raise up, cause you can't' have it back  
You said ""I ain't never got gaffled like that""  
Off the end of the gat you choke  
Short Dog's in the house ""Whattup loc?""  
Nuttin' but a come up  
Gimme that bass, and don't try to run up  
'Cause you'll get banked somethin' sweet  
Ice Cube and the Lench Mob, is jackin' for beats  
  
Huh, and even if you're down with my crew  
Yo Chuck man, I don't understand this man  
You got to slow down  
I jack them too  
And then we'll freak it  
Kick that bass, and look what we did  
Fade the grade, played, and made a few mil  
And I keep stealin  
Ice Cube'll make it funky  
But right about now - let's get up in the hump  
But I don't party and shake my butt  
I leave that to the brothers with the funny haircuts  
And it'll drive you nuts  
Steal your beat, and give it that gangsta touch  
Like jackin' at night  
Say hi to the three fifty-seven I'm packin'  
And it sounds so sweet  
Ice Cube and the Lench Mob, is jackin' for beats  
  
Ice Cube, will take a funky beat and reshape it  
Locate a dope break, and then I break it  
And give it that gangsta lean  
Dead in your face as I turn up the bass  
I make punk suckers run and duck because  
I don't try to hide cause you know that I love to  
Jack a fool for his beat and then I'm Audi  
So when I come to your town don't crowd me  
Cause I know, you're gonna want to kick it with me  
But I know, none of y'all can get with me  
So you think you're protected  
Well you are til you put a funky beat on a record  
Then I have to show and prove and use your groove  
Cause suckers can't fade the Cube  
And if I jack you and you keep comin'  
I'll have you marks a 100 Miles and Running!  
  
Stop stop stop stop stop!

When I wanna do it, how I wanna do it  
And you better hope I don't do it to you  
Now, I don't care what momma got to say  
I don't care what grandmomma got to say  
Nigga I'm grown  
Let me tell you a lil' somethin' about me  
  
I was born not to give a fuck, wanna drink, get your cup  
Turn it up, throw it up, take the world, blow it up  
Somebody slow it up, roll it up, smoke it up  
My own momma can't keep me from loc'n up  
One ear out the other, one man out to smother  
The neighborhood, that left me here without my brother  
Fuck you under covers and you dirty motherfuckers  
In the hood, that still fuck without rubbers  
Club hop, bar hop, car shop, nail shop  
To the mall, spend it all, why the hell not  
What bills, what rent, don't know what's spent  
Why you care, do you work for the government?

A nigga lie steal and borrow, and cheatings OK  
Don't you tell these motherfuckers that my name is O'Shea  
Cause I'ma fuck up my baby's credit, let him regret it  
7 months old he's already got a jail record  
I'm the one to blame, put it in my momma name  
She's a drama queen, but I got the bling bling  
I need the watch and the bracelet and the earrings  
I need you all to show up at my hearings  
Tell the judge I'm a nice nigga, good nigga  
And I'ma play the sad face when he look nigga

Tell momma, at least she can send some drawers  
These walls, make y'all forget about me  
I'm comin' home, in 2033  
But that's irrelevant, did you get the mail I sent  
What I tell a bitch, you better stay celibate  
She start lyin to me, tell me who she ain't fuckin'  
Never tell me that my homeboys ain't nothin'  
Bun in the oven, it belong to my cousin

Here's another topic I'm addressin  
so learn a quick lesson, about your Smith and Wesson  
Sit your ass back and comprehend  
as I let you know about man's best friend  
Now remember: it used to be a dog like Lassie  
but now in ninety-one it's a gun if you asked me  
Just like a jimmy hat's used for protection  
I use my nine when suckers start to flexin  
Cause if you run up and try to play mine  
I'd rather have a AK than a fuckin canine  
Cause if you shot your gun, and my dog tried to fetch her  
me and the dog's goin out on a stretcher  
And I ain't with that, so I gotta get that  
big black gat, aim and I hit that  
Forget about a dog fool, he'll shit in the den  
Nowadays.. a gat is man's best friend  
  
""Bow-wow-wow-yippie-yo-yippie-yay""  
""Dog-catcher, dog-catcher!""  
""Bow-wow-yippie-yo-yippie-yay""  
""Man's best friend""  
""I can dig it!""  
  
Here is the reason why Ice Cube pack  
Just in case the little punks try to jack  
I can't put a motherfuckin pitbull  
under a coat, in the small of my back  
So I gotta take my beretta, and I betcha  
it'll probably work, a 100 percent better  
Cause it'll keep me out of danger  
with sixteen in the clip and one in the chamber  
So this goes to all y'all intruders  
Beware of the owner, cause the owner is a shooter  
I don't just wanna give your ass rabies  
I'd rather have your ass pushing up daisies  
And I can't do that with Benji,  
Rin Tin Tin, or Spuds McKenzie  
Forget about a dog fool, he'll shit in the den  
Nowadays, a gat is man's best friend  
  
""Just don't let me see you shoot no dogs!""  
""Hey, I got shots fired here, send me another unit""

Over thirty, white, male, middle class""

You claim you want to put in work  
Plotting to blow up a church

You'll gun down a congregation in Jesus' name  
Using me as a scapegoat, well cracker don't sleep  
Far from a goat, more like a black sheep  
Lamb of God, and it's odd  
That Allah is a man that don't need a tan  
And you can't stand when I talk like that  
And why do black men have to walk like that?

Westide Maad Circle bailing with a double barrel

And all I need is knowledge of self and ammunition is my best friend  
When it's time to roll nigga, we ain't calling on Jesus  
I'm calling Mad Dog for the 9 millimeters  
Cause I give the song with those peckerwoods to the fullest  
And a bitch by the name of America's on it  
The same bitch that jacked my forefathers  
And the Indians took my motherfucking religion  
Place a holy Bible in my hand, but for what?  
Like Jim Kelly said, ""You try to set me up?"" Shit...  
I'm too slick for your lies in disguise  
When will you devils open your eyes and realize?  
Like Pepsi, niggas got a new generation  
And we don't want your American education  
Ain't no brain washing this way  
Fuck America, Tom Meztger, and KKK  
And to the cracker named J.B. Stoner  
Don't let me catch you on no corners  
I see you on TV talking more shit  
But just like your punk-ass ancestors, you's a bitch  
You's a bitch if I ever saw one  
Grand Wizard bring your ass on Imperial so we can get physical  
And watch God show and prove  
Not only mentally but physically the black man rules  
So run devil run, you's to best start running  
Because the niggas are coming, oh, the niggas are coming

So what the fuck can I do to make a profit?  
Catch a flight to St. Louis  
That's cool, cause nobody knew us  
We stepped off the plane  
Four gang bangers, professional crack slangers  
Rented a car at wholesale  
Drove to the ghetto, and checked in a motel  
Unpacked and I grab the three-eighty  
Cause where we stayin', niggas look shady  
But they can't fade South Central  
Cause bustin' a cap is fundamental  
Checkin' out every block close

Bust a you Bone, and let's clear these niggaz out  
  
Hey hey man, whats up nigga?  
Yo, well this Lench Mob nigga!

Still had the L.A. mentality  
Bust a cap, and out of there in a hurry  
Wouldn't you know, a driveby in Missouri  
Them fools got popped  
Took their corner next day, set up shop  
And it's better than slangin' in the Valley  
Triple the profit makin' more than I did in Cali  
Breakin' off rocks like Barney Rubble

Los Angeles which are known for their driveby shootings  
Have migrated into East St. Louis  
Leaving three dead and two others injured  
No arrests have been made  
Police say this is a nationwide trend  
With similar incidents occurring in Texas, Michigan, and Oklahoma

St. Louis niggas want they corner back

It's illegal business, niggas still can't stick together

That L.A. ain't all, surf and sun  
But we ain't thinkin', bout the boys  
Feudin', like the Hatfields and McCoys  
Now the shit's gettin' tricky  
Cause now they lookin' for the colors and the khakis  
Damn, the spot's gettin' hot from the battle  
About to pack up and start slangin' in Seattle  
But the NARC's, raid about six in the morning  
Try to catch a nigga while he's yawnin'  
Put his glock to my chest as I paused  
Went to jail in my motherfuckin' drawers  
Tryin' to give me, fifty-seven years  
Face'll be full of those tattooed tears  
It's the same old story and the same old nigga stuck  
And the public defender ain't givin' a fuck  
The fool must be sparkin'  
Talkin' about a double life plea bargain  
You got to deal with the Crips and Bloods by hand G  
Plus the Black Guerilla family  
And the white pride don't like Northside  
And it's a riot if any more niggas die  
No parole or probation

Try to have beef with a fucking bull  
With no teeth I'm about to pull  
I'm that dentist about to finish  
All the spoils go to the winners  
Don't go mad cause my hands are clean  
I'm the king, never flee on the scene

Need a heart? Here's a start!  
Don't you worry if you need the courage  
Y'all motherfuckers know where you heard it  
Gangsta, gangsta, thank me now  
rap god nigga, please take a bow  
Can't take bullshit from a cow  
Don't ask who, I'mma fuck it out  
Thirsting howl will get you murdered  
Come to the boss if you need some work  
Come to the boss if you need some herd  
White collar boy, if you check my shit  
Get on my sun, get likely burn  
Gotta get my boys a pop of dirt  
Putting the rap game on the lurp  
Fuck with them and I will revert  
Back to the old days, back to the old ways  
Back to the Ak's fucking up doorways

Cause my crimmies move like zombies  
Wha? Being heads to the 90'  
Don't act like you don't know where to find me  
Now, if you wanna get by me  
Look at all the grinding,  
Niggas all behind me

Most rappers, they wanna fuck sangers  
I'm a nigga, that wanna bone T'Penga

Come feed 'em, either Jesus or Mohammad  
All we get is vomit, come like a comet  
Put it in my brain Lord, put it in my stomach  
Only you can do it, I'ma learn from it  
Do what I gotta do, try not to plum it  
America used to shoot like reptiles  
Don't worry tomorrow, let's get this right now  
They wanna run us in the ground  
Educate yourself, before they dumb you down  
Get your money boy, the legal way  
Beat 'em with they own bullshit if you may  
Now rich white men they got the world fucked up  
Why should I give a fuck about a Styrofoam cup

You know what I mean bitch

Ice Cube for President, let's just do it for the hell of it  
See how I run the government  
Make money irrelevant  
I might tell a chick, it's illegal to resell of it  
Secret service don't know where the hell I went  
Sorry yall, I had to fuck a super delicate  
Dream ticket, Ice Cube and Obama  
American dream, Ice Cube and yo mama  
The Terminator, are you Sarah Conner?  
Arnold Schwarzenegger, can kill who he wanna  
In California, they strap you to a jury  
And murder your ass, in front of your attorney  
Do you really wanna take this journey?

I bailed through, they wanna put up in bail view  
Cause my point of view is not red, white and blue  
It's black and blue residue  
I know what crack can do, to a whole fuckin' avenue  
Spit on it, and they'll get mad at you  
You know I do this bullshit for your gratitude  
I'ma nigga with a attitude  
I'ma do what I gotta do, just to change my latitude  
In the system, rollin' with my diamonds glistening  
And niggas listenin', from your local prison  
I'ma prism, your only vision is a rainbow in the sky

"Verse one: ice cube  
  
Peace. Haha don't make me laugh!  
All I hear is muthafucker's talkin' sucotash  
Livin' large, tellin' me to get out the gang  
I'm a nigga, gotta live by the trigger  
How the fuck do you figure?  
That I can say peace and the gunshots won't cease  
Every cop killin' goes ignored  
They just send another nigga to the morgue  
A point scored- they could give a fuck about us  
They rather catch us with guns and white powder  
If I was old, they'd probably be a friend of me  
Since I'm young, they consider me the enemy  
They kill ten of me to get the job correct  
To serve, protect, and break a niggas neck  
'cause I'm the one with the trunk of funk  
And 'fuck tha police' in the tape deck  
You should listen to me 'cause there's more to see  
Call my neighborhood a ghetto 'cause it houses minorities  
The other color don't know you can run but not hide  
These are tales from the darkside...  
  
Verse two:  
  
You wanna free africa, I stare at yuh  
'cause we ain't got it too good in america  
I can't fuck with them overseas  
My homeboy died over a key of cocaine  
It was plain and simple  
The 9mm went to the temple  
Was the sound I put the bitch down  
And ran to the schoolyard bathroom  
Looked in the trash can yo it had room  
So I ducked my ass in it for a minute  
Covered with sweat I had the layback  
Mad as fuck, thinkin' about the payback  
Tonite the crew gonna have a little fun  
I went home and cocked the barrel of my shotgun  
It's gettin' critical - I start the five point o  
There they go - drive real slow  
I yelled out 'ice cube sucka'  
Shot gun hit - and murder mutahfuckers  
I told you last album, when I got a sawed off, bodies are hard off  
Its a shame, that niggas die young  
But to the light side it don't matter none  
It'll be a drive by homicide  
But to me it's just another tale from the darkside...  
  
Verse three: chuck d  
  
Standing in the middle of war  
The middle we flex  
When we die, they won't make check  
Ebony can't see to the darkside  
The term they apply to us is a nigga  
Call it what you want, 'cause I'm comin' from the coroner  
Same applies with a phd  
Who'z black - don't wanna role - sells his soul  
Watch his head go rollin'  
Who the fuck are they foolin'?  
Nobody knows, but I suppose the color of my clothes  
Matches the color of the one on my face as they wonder what's under my waist  
[standin on the verge] of them gettin' brown  
That's a fact got a fear on their bozack  
Run, run, run, their ass off, they can not hide  
Yet cube, they can't fuck with the darkside!

"It's like a holocaust to the boss when I toss  
Too much knowledge kicked then you're lost  
In a shuffle of feet Jinx the fiddler  
And I control your mind like Hitler  
You bow and vow to authority  
See now a sucker with a style just boring me  
So I show K.N.O.W.  
L.E.D.G.E. it might trouble you  
Then I transform like a Deception  
With a mic as a bomb  
In my right palm  
But I don't stay calm  
So panic  
Others can't flow so they go schizophrenic  
You thought I dropped a dud in your face  
Until you taste the blood of the bass  
Then you faint, or better yet pass out  
When I'm on the mic, believe it's ass out  
You think you're raw so you draw  
You lose, you're hung, you bite your tongue  
The whole town saw in awe as you strangle  
A noose on your neck, and you dangle  
From side to side in the blazing heat  
You're beat, you're dead, the fools fell off  
You feel you're turning red, it's said  
That your head burst  
And this is only the first verse  
Of the bomb  
  
Don't break up the fight let them rumble  
Over the years I've watched some go super-bad quick  
Now the smell of the pen has got them sick to the stomach  
Now ask yourself, who's stupid?  
I take funky funky beats and I loop it  
And pimp slap you in the face with the bass  
And the boom from the bomb that I drop  
Stop  
You have a flat top as a fashion  
I love Black women with a passion  
But when they gotta go and show their ass in  
I gotta clown the hoes, yeah  
You gotta watch the ones with the big derrieres  
They'll steer you wrong  
Ice Cube's got it going on, hit me  
For the gangster boogie two times for the gangster rhyme  
The system ain't wholesome  
They want to put a young brother in Folsom  
And others see me on lockdown  
But I come up foul then they get knocked out, word  
To the brother that rolls the herb  
Everybody getting knocked to the curb like that  
Jinx got the gat, and it's a fact  
He'll kick a funky beat to peel your cap  
Now who's the mack?  
Who's the hoe?  
Who's the trick?  
I got many, many styles won't you take a pick  
But don't be alarmed  
When I trip and stumble and fumble  
And drop the (rewind)  
Drop the bomb  
  
I'm solo, you ask how I'm living  
Still dropping more shit than a pigeon  
With the L, the E, the N, the see, the H,  
The M, the O, the be , the great  
Lyrics that make the beat swing and I gotcha  
It's the hip-hopper that don't like coppers  
And if you try to upset the pot son  
You get kicked in the chest like a shotgun  
I make the beats, I make the breaks  
I make the rhymes that make you shake  
Make you find  
Ice Cube never caught in the middle  
I make shit to kick you in the ass a little  
And still never hesitate to stutter step  
Or bust a repetition on the mic  
Still dissing all the hype  
From left to right  
How many left to fight?  
So what that Lench Mob like?

You better check ya friends  
And see if ya baby momma left with them

Big bear wit a nigga named Gentle Ben

Wait for the cable guy, even let him in  
Not me, I won't flex or bend  
Just 'cause a hoe promise me some trim  
You better get wit the rest of them  
Cause can't none of y'all even fuck wit Kim

Not just the fake analyst on cannabis, who only say that the world is  
Scandalous, without findin' out a way to handle this  
Dismantle this, either with the rhyme or the fist  
How the fuck we get in the belly of this bitch?

Lyin' to the enemies, wild conspiracies

Seven thirty fives bring on bitches lies  
While you bullshitin', I'm hard hittin' like  
2pac, I keep spittin' 'till my heart stop  
Young niggas tryin' to tell me that I'm played  
Once they say you played, nigga you must be payed (HA HA! huh ha)

Talkin' 'bout somethin' (what?), that ain't meanin' nothin'  
'Bout your second cousin (hm), who be always buzzin'  
Where she was or wasn't, who she now fuckin'  
Stories by the dozen Punch you got the sequel (what?)  
To let you tell it Randy Moss is your people  
It's evident, your ass lie like the president  
But stretch marks on your mouth is the evidence (ha ha)  
How the fuck can your friends be the Benjamin's? (punk)  
And your little ass car's full of fender Benz  
There you go on the stand with your hand up (lyin')  
Testifyin' about a man that's in handcuffs  
We should do you like the Mack said  
And if he lie like a crackhead pop 'em like a black head  
Let him ooze, let him loose  
Let him lie by his motherfuckin' ass on the news (yeah yeah)

This is my canvas  
I'mma paint it how I want it baby, oh I  
This is my canvas  
I'ma paint it, paint it, paint it, how I want it nigga  
Fuck you cause there  
There is no right or wrong, only a song  
I like to write alone, be in my zone  
Think back to Forest Hills, no perfect home  
But the only thing like home I've ever known  
Until they snatched it from my mama  
And foreclosed her on the loan  
I'm so sorry that I left you there to deal with that alone  
I was up in New York City chasin' panties, gettin' dome  
Had no clue what you was goin' through  
How could you be so strong?  
And how could I be so selfish, I know I can be so selfish  
I could tell by how I treat you with my girl  
Damn she so selfless, but she put up with my way  
Because she loves me like you do  
And though it don't always show I love her just like I love you  
And I need to treat you better  
Wish you could live forever, so we could spend more time together

Another day another rhyme ho  
Another day another time zone  
Today I woke up feelin' horny so it's only right  
I got two bitches playin' on my trombone  
Keep up, never sure where the words would take me  
Niggas eat em up, and regurgitate me  
Shit jumped tight never slurred it lazy  
Give a virgin the urge to rape me  
Nigga please  
Best friends really make great for enemies  
My watch came niggas can't wait for one of these  
I see you nigga, this ain't no Rolex, it's a AP nigga  
I'm hot, dog, catch up to me nigga  
Uh, couldn't resist  
Aim for the stars and I shouldn't have missed  
But I was ridin' on fumes so I stopped by the moon  
Now I'm sittin' on the hood of this bitch  
Like thanks for the view  
Waitin' on thanks from a few cause without me you wouldn't exist  
You know that shit gave you the blueprint don't forget  
Cole is your phone on zero percent  
Going off, now niggas showin' off  
Niggas swear they hard but they flowin' soft

"Yea, n-gga  
I'm gon ahead and murder this sh-t  
Voice gone and sh-t, I think it's gonna make it sound a little ill, just a
little iller  
Yup, Fayettenam, n-gga  
  
Yea, Carolina blue kicks pedal to the medal  
Feeling like a puppet and the devil is Geppetto  
Letter to the ghetto-hold ya head high  
You can pick apart my raps I ain't told ya na' lie  
I want a little darker, like to f-cking tan line  
Go on, look for a better n-gga, girl you can't find  
Fine young man with an old man mind,  
No time for the tickle, f-ck the whole mankind  
Aw no ma'am, I'm an old land mine  
I been waiting to blow up for a long damn time, now I'm armed and I'm-  
Fayettenam's finest, Carolina saviour, marijuana blazer  
Only on occasion cause my mind be racing  
Lost in my thoughts so my eyes be Asian  
Thinking how these rap n-ggas got to be faking  
Whole style obviously copied, pasted-plagiarized swag  
May arrived last but when it's all said and done I'ma be ahead of them  
Way that I describe it, prescribe a n-gga medicine  
Way that I be fly-I be higher than the Jet-e-sons  
Moving on up, n-gga higher than the Jeffersons  
All about the Benjamin's, bad chicks send em' in!  
Basic hoes toss em out! Can't even get waffle house  
Hating n-ggas chalk em out! Go and get the coffin out  
What chu talking bout?  
Little man, my sh-t hair burning you not even a little tan  
I'm I'll enough to kill cancer, baby I'm Chemo  
Down in Miami, and I throw like Marino  
Get a whole lot of you know, and she bald like an eagle.  
No, not up top, but down there  
She said she want to hop on top girl I don't care  
You better get yours before I reach mines cause then I'm throwing peace signs  
If you a freak I can take you to ya peak, girl I do it to the maxima-Nissan  
And I hope you a believer  
I'm quarterbacking trynna get cha open like receivers  
Far from an overnight achievers, Cole is like the leader of the new n-ggas!  
To tell the truth, I'm only f-cking with a few n-ggas, if that!  
The rest of ya'll n-ggas get lapped  
I sit back, and reflect on the rap game I came from out of no where  
N-gga, I swear them lames ain't know how to prepare  
Got n-ggas shouting out ""The Ville-I got to go there! ""  
Boy, don't you know you get shot over there?  
I say my prayers cause this life ain't fair,  
A bunch of backstabbing n-ggas hope the knife ain't there  
A bunch of temptation facing when your wife ain't there  
Yea late at night, when I got the phone call and made her right  
When my crib was straight ahead, shorty gave me head, hit it then I quit it
'fore she even made the bed  
Damn I'm no good  
But damn it's so good  
I'm picturing that body like a camera phone would  
Something like Rihanna while I'm up in that vagina  
Type of chick that only dress in something that's designer  
I could give a f-ck long as there's something that's behind her  
Got the type of bump that make a dog want to hump her  
Back to the topic-actually forgot it  
Hoes, money, I'm the shit... Oh yea I'm reminded  
The way I put the words together cleverly align them  
These other rap n-ggas shouldn't never be a problem  
And I'm ghost

"And now I'm denial  
And it don't take no x-ray to see right through my smile

I see my niggas down,  
Ooh, I'm letting you know  
That it ain't no gun they can make that could kill my soul  
Oh, no  
  
So now it was like the officer is pulling him inside the car and he's trying
to pull away. At no time di the officer said that he was going to do anything
until he pulled out his weapon was drawn and he said, ""I'll shoot you"" or,
""I'm going to shoot"" and in the same moment, the first shot went off. We
looked down and he was shot and there was blood coming from him. Then we took
off running.

Are we all alone fighting on our own  
Please give me a chance  
I don't wanna dance  
Something's got me down  
I was there my ground,  
Don't just stand around  
Don't just stand around  
  
As we took off running I ducked and hid for my life, because I was fearing for
my life. I hid behind the first car I saw. My friend,he kept running, he
feared for me too. So as the officer was trying to get out the car he pursued
my friend but his weapon was drawn. Now he didn't see any weapon drawn at him
or anything like that, us going for no weapon. His weapon was already drawn.
He shot again, and once my friend felt that shot, he turned around and put his
hands in the air, and started to get down, but the officer still approached
with his weapon drawn and he fired seven more shots and my friend died.

Just seen my father for the first time in a minute  
And when I say a minute I mean years man  
Damn, a whale could have swam in them tears fam  
Cause as I left them I reflected on my younger days  
When it was just me and my brother and my mother played  
Father, cause no other man bothered  
Not even my biological, it never seemed logical  
But I accepted it cause I ain't know no better  
Thought I was brighter than a Polo sweater  
No pops was like Martin with no Coretta  
So many things you could have told me  
And saved me the trouble of lettin' my mistakes show me  
I feel like you barely know me  
And that's a shame cause our last name is the same  
That blood type flowin' through our veins is the same  
My mama left you and maybe your anger's to blame  
But that's no excuse, only you and God know the truth  
And why you only call monthly, barely ever saw me  
Spend some summers with you and played with my cousin Maury  
Maybe I should be tellin' you fuck you cause you selfish  
But I want a father so bad, I can't help it

I swear to God, wish I could bullet proof my niggas  
Can't get no jobs, but they still recruitin' niggas  
We tryna stand tall when it gets to crucial niggas

By the time he get out, she gon' be four  
Now will his girl stay down?  
Ain't no doubt, she love him yeah that's fo sho  
But temptation stays round  
And if she strayed, how could he ever know?  
Never know and so, she goes to the club on the weekend  
A little freakin', but them niggas holla  
But she never speakin', but tonight I see the devil creepin'  
'Cause she been lonely, she ain't felt a man in seven seasons  
Damn! She do the best that she can  
Her mama tellin' her to find another man  
She college educated with a felon boyfriend  
That's what she thinkin' tonight  
Maybe she's right, but please  
  
Stay down mama! Gotta be strong, don't break down mama!  
Please, stay down mama! Gotta be strong, don't break down mama!

Son to his mother or a sister and brother, man this bond is deep  
We go a couple years and don't even speak, but know it's love though  
Never let em' dirty your name I got the utmost respect for you,  
Came back home and had to check for you,  
Word round town is you locked down  
Some older niggas snatched you up gave you a rock now  
Damn, hey could it be, she like ""if you was me you wouldn't wait for me  
Living fast you wouldn't mash the brakes for me""  
Big city slicker nigga on a higher track  
Bigger now but when she send a letter always write her back  
And time revealed, she feels that she settled too soon  
While she see me go for mines and she admire that  
We speak about time as if we could just buy it back  
If only it was that simple, damn I miss you

Only five years old but sense danger in my house  
I was too young too scrap you but damn if I ain't want to  
I'm blowing up fast and I hope these words haunt you  
Uh, thirteen years knew you more then my real pops  
Put me on to 'Pac, and all the rappers that killed cops  
Who would've thought you'd leave my momma high and dry  
Last words to a bitch nigga ""why you lie?""  
Feeling bitter so these words might seem jumbled  
When you left I watched that lady crumble  
I know probably by now you a old man,  
But I still I feel I won't be satisfied until we throw hands  
For all the ass whoppings  
Heard you tryna' talk to that punk don't call me  
You ain't shit and I'm scared it rubbed off on me  
  
[Hook:]  
  
[Verse 3: J. Cole]  
I heard you on that shit I hope it ain't true  
Was hard to holla at you last time I came through  
Could barely recognize you, naw nigga this ain't you  
Cause you ain't lookin' like that nigga that I once knew  
And plus you act like you don't know me  
We was homies, now you call me by my rap name  
See me do my thing, you expecting me to act strange  
Hey holla but you on my mind nigga  
I don't forget the good times nigga  
White tee's in the club, jeans baggy as fuck  
Sometimes I look back on my life, that was the happiest stuff  
You had potential to be monumental, ville mentality  
You know that old kill or be killed mentality  
I look at where you at now it's a, real fatality  
Cause where you supposed to be is on top, close to me  
Chasin' hoes like the old days,  
But now we overseas, dawg  
Congratulations on your seat  
Yo my nigga can I holla at you

"Look at me, pathetic nigga, this chain that I bought  
You mix greed, pain and fame, this is heinous result  
Let these words be the colors I'm just paintin my heart  
I'm knee-deep in the game and it ain't what I thought  
Copped the range rover my girl got the mercedes  
Iced out crazy I wanna shine like baby  
Compared to that nigga I ain't even got a bib yet  
Truth be told I ain't even bought a crib yet  
This is everything they told a nigga not to do  
Image is everything I see, it got a lot to do  
With the way that people perceive, and what they believe  
Money short so this jewelry is like a weave  
Meant to deceive and hear niggas say I see you  
Now bitches wanna fuck you and niggas wanna be you  
And police wanna stop you, frisk you wonder what he do  
If a hater snatch yo chain, I bet it still won't free you  
Cause I'll be right back grinding 'til I cop another  
I sit and think about all this shit I coulda copped my mother  
My partner said that's just the game my nigga  
Swear I heard my jeweler say, ""Here go your chain my nigga""  
  
This is chaining day  
I need you to love me, love me  
Chaining day, my chaining day  
I need you to love me, love me  
My chaining day  
My last piece, I swear, my guilt heavy as this piece I wear  
They even iced out Jesus' hair  
My last piece, I swear, they even iced out Jesus' hair  
  
Ice on this white Jesus seem a little unholy  
The real strange thing about this iced out Rolly  
It's the same shit a broke black nigga get gassed at  
The same shit a rich white mo'fucka laugh at  
Well laugh on white man, I ain't paid as you  
But I bet your rims ain't the same age as you  
And I ain't got no investment portfolio  
But my black and white diamonds shinin' like a Oreo  
I know back home where niggas sit today  
He rock a chain and he always got some shit to say  
Even back when I was broke I knew his shit was fake  
He'd prolly sneeze too hard and his shit could break  
But hey, you know the sayin', ""Fake it 'til you make it""  
Me, I did the opposite, made it then I faked it  
And actin' like I gave a fuck, money I was savin' up  
To buy a crib that's gated to that hundred racks  
I gave it up, for what  
  
I need you to love me, love me  
Chaining day, my chaining day  
I need you to love me, love me  
My chaining day  
My last piece, I swear, my guilt heavy as this piece I wear  
They even iced out Jesus' hair  
My last piece, I swear  
  
Lord  
This is the last time  
Told my accountant, It's the last time  
I swear this is the last time  
I know that I said that last time  
But this the last time  
Mama I swear this is the last time  
So don't take my Chains from me  
This is the last time  
'Cause I chose this slavery  
This is the last time  
Don't take my chains from me  
This is the last time  
'Cause I love this slavery  
I need you to love me, love me, love me  
I need you to love me, love me, love me  
I need you to love me, love me, love me  
I need you to love me, love me, love me  
I need you to love me, love me, love me  
I need you to love me, love me, love me

Problem with the game now, there ain't no innovation  
I see my shit all in your shit, we call that imitation  
And they say that's flattering, but I ain't flattered at all  
Matter fact y'all need to practice that more  
See my man Nate asked me if I gained weight  
I said nah, my pockets got fatter, that's all  
Money was an issue, but now that that's solved  
I ball, I ball, like Kobe in the fall  
Put trophies on my wall, rather trophies on my mantle  
Dog my shows be off the handle, take the proceeds go to gamble  
Bet it on black and pray, I quadruple my salary  
If I win, maybe then I could pay Sallie Mae  
Told her I be dealin' with some real life shit  
She be askin' ""when?"", bitch! When I feel like it  
  
[Chorus]  
Cole World, Cole Life, Cold Blooded  
I be on my shit, and look at, all the hoes love it  
Got a hundred fifty bitches in the club starin' at me  
How that feel? Very happy!

I got what you need right here  
I got what you need right here  
I got what you need right here  
I got what you need right here  
  
Uh, turn up the eight o eights for me  
Back when I was starvin' no one made a plate for me  
Now I do it big and that's my day to day story  
I got the type of shit that make a hater say sorry  
Bitch, I made this in the crib, watchin' Belly  
Eatin' peanut butter jelly, what the fuck the niggas tell me  
They say I'm takin' long, I tell em patience is a virtue  
I'm goin' all out and bitch I never had a curfew  
See, when you're spittin' so real  
Suddenly these phony niggas lose they appeal  
Got em' feelin' like my niggas when they lose, they appeal  
Then it's back to the cell, back to the hell  
At times I watch the news and see they talkin' bout diplomacy  
And they ain't got a clue my niggas ain't got they diplomas, see  
Rappers show me love, I wonder what it could be  
I think they scared of me, and they should be

I aint never been the one for fourth down puntin'  
Aiming at a couple heads, bitch I'm crown huntin'  
Red dots cause a nigga dread locks  
So I lock pick just to lock shit back  
I want Money, Power, Respect since the Lox said that  
Better stay up on your toes, this is not tic tac  
Yet, I'm a breath of fresh air, you can place your bets here  
Ballin' like a Laker you should pray for next year

And I'm knee deep in the game it's quick sand and I keep leakin'  
The label heat seekin', nigga aint sign me, what the f-ck was he thinkin'  
They say I killed the game, that was only pre-season  
  
I'm heavy  
I'm Heavy  
  
Man, I'm already hot, you can say I'm pre-heated  
If money talks, mine telling your's ""be seated""

Illest nigga in the game bitch and you can retweet it  
Email the shit make sure you cc it  
For these f-ck niggas who don't wanna believe it  
I be in the airport damn near bare foot  
Security hollin' out, Cole we need it  
Getting high as f-ck and I don't even be weeded  
No point drinkin' I can't even be faded  
Real recognise real like they related  
You aint no f-cking G boy, your style G-Rated  
Hatred is flattery I'm glad to be hated

Even tho you gone, your thought alone can lift us up

My niggas know that I love 'em  
Give 'em roses while they can smell 'em  
Cause ain't no tellin' who'll be here tomorrow  
Used to borrow your digital scale  
Flippin' them sales  
But now it's digital dash while you're still in the past  
Boy, trust me when I tell you, the picture got much bigger  
The swishers and dutch fill up  
Bitches in lust with us  
Momma would dissapprove, losing my way  
Lost in the sauce, this bolognese is so amazing  
Had a talk and she remark: ""you so engaging""  
Running game, it's all the same

Years ago his favorite uncle had married my mother and  
Here we are, runnin' through the Ville like dumb and dumber and  
For that summer man I swear I wish you was my brother then  
Well time passed and we fell off cause you moved back home

Niggas thought he wouldn't make it 'till he proved that wrong  
12 years later on the radio that Who Dat song  
Your homeboy bumps the Warm Up now he buggin'  
Cause he looking at the cover and say ""Damn yo that's my cousin""  
And niggas looking at you like you lying but you wasn't  
Next thing I know you blowing up my line all a sudden  
And I'm showing love saying ""yo look what I did,  
Ain't nobody coming from here ever did this shit this big""  
But now you saying ""Yo enough about you,  
Shit what about me, nigga what about me?  
Oh you forgot about me?  
Saying niggas showed you how to rap, now you don't know how to act  
Boy I'm at the bottom you could pull a nigga out of that  
Put me in a video, yo put me on your hottest track  
Bring me on the road with you, you know 'cuz got yo back  
And I'm strapped up if them niggas act up  
I see you headed to the top you need to let me catch up  
Please let me catch up  
Won't you let me catch up man""  
I'll see you when I see you

Will they say I was a sinner or pretend I was a saint  
Will I go down as a winner, what's the picture they gon paint  
Wouldn't say that I'm a quitter that's one thing I know I aint aint  
Will they tarnish, will they taint?

I'd much rather sit up in first class  
Should I admit that a slutty b-tch was my first smash  
Was it experience so nah I didn't wear it out  
Always thought my first time would be with someone I cared about  
But being a virgin was something to be embarrassed bout  
I used to ask for practice so I wasn't scared out my mind  
You call it rhymes I call it clearing out my mind  
Was just a young boy staring out my blind  
Till I got free from my momma leash  
Running loose through the streets  
Like a stray dog in heat  
And we looking for some freaks can you play  
Pardon me, what's your name, don't mistake me for no lame  
No not me  
She do hours on the team cause she seen how tall I'd be  
In the club dappin' n-ggas, even til he are-I-P  
Damn, you win some, you lose some  
That just how it's happens  
And if a n-gga step up to ya, then you gotta scrap em  
Your name is all you got, throwing hands by the bathroom  
It's funny I barely told nobody I started rapping  
Cause see some n-ggas was haters that I viewed as clowns  
At 14 I knew I was the nicest dude around  
I gotta make a move, I gotta do this now  
If they don't know your dreams, than they can't shoot em down

"[J. Cole - Verse 1]  
Strictly for the survivors  
The 800 number dodgers  
Boy, what I tell ya ass bout picking up that phone  
When the number unknown  
Tell them people I aint home  
Half black learning white lies  
Niggas broke her heart now she trying white guys  
Too ashamed to bring around cause her homegirls'll clown like  
""Girl I aint know you like 'em bitesize""  
She embarrassed now  
On edge cause she gotta meet his parents now  
They probably think I'm no good for 'em  
Too dark, too thick, too hood for 'em  
Now she sitting at the dinner table wondering what I'm doing here  
They got me feeling like a job interview in here  
They asking questions about a 5 year plan  
She saying ""who I'm foolin', they could never understand""  
They could never understand

Look at me  
I Just can't believe  
What they've done to me

[J. Cole - Verse 2]  
(fuck is that smell)  
I smell bullshit, it must be an election year  
The more I listen man the more you sound less sincere  
Still I'm wathcing cnn tryna keep up  
In my interviews maybe I should speak up  
Tell the world how I feel like you lying all the time  
And keep 'em niggas walking blind all the time  
But the same niggas think I'm fucking dimes all the time  
Like I'm walking round with money on my mind all the time  
And I feed into it  
I'd rather make tracks where I bleed into it  
The singles only the look to sell these niggas the book  
I can only pray that one day you'll read into it  
If not, fuck it, I got my own problems  
Fuck ya beats nigga I produce my own albums  
I zone out, that old sound that I've grown out of  
Was born out of being broke with hope  
But it don't matter I'm on Saturn now and I won't shatter  
As long as this blood grows in my bone marrow I'm gonna gather my thoughts  
As sharp as a bow and arrow  
Back when I had no dough and no apparrel  
My flow's thorough, now I'm more aware of the? A nigga face  
Loaded pistols with nickle plates, the nigga fake  
That's why I call the shit a race  
Tha gony of defeat, w ish the elite could get a taste  
  
[Chorus:]  
Look at me  
I Just can't believe  
What they've done to me  
We could never get free  
I just wanna be (I just wanna be)  
Look at me  
I Just can't believe  
What they've done to me  
We could never get free  
I just wanna be  
I just wanna dream

"Mo' liquor when we ride, toast niggas we alive

If you wanna come see, you know where I'm at  
Go getters on the rise, toast niggas we arrived  
Old niggas step aside, aint no coming back  
Big things on my mind, switch lanes and recline  
Get brains from a dime, How you love that?  
  
[J. Cole - Verse 1]  
Alone in my zone, tell me don't it sound stunning  
Been f-cked the world but she just now cummin'  
If I ever fell off I would hit the ground runnin'  
I aint never been the one for fourth down puntin'  
Aiming at a couple heads, bitch I'm crown huntin'  
Red dots cause a nigga dread locks  
So I lock pick just to lock shit back  
I want Money, Power, Respect since the Lox said that  
Better stay up on your toes, this is not tic tac  
Yet, I'm a breath of fresh air, you can place your bets here  
Ballin' like a Laker you should pray for next year  
Cause I'm repeating and I'm three-peatin'  
And I'm knee deep in the game it's quick sand and I keep sinkin'  
The label heat seekin', nigga aint sign me, what the f-ck was he thinkin'  
They say I killed the game, that was only pre-season

[J Cole - Verse 2]  
No album to my name and I'm already hot, you can say I'm pre-heated  
If money talks, mine telling your's ""be seated""  
Cut my leg off I wouldn't be defeated  
Illest nigga in the game bitch and you can retweet it  
Email the shit make sure you cc it  
For these f-ck niggas who don't wanna believe it  
I be in the airport damn near bare foot  
Security hollin' out, Cole we need it  
Getting high as f-ck and I don't even be weeded  
No point drinkin' I can't even be faded  
Real recognise real like they related  
You aint no f-cking G boy, your style G-Rated  
Hatred is flattery I'm glad to be hated  
F-ckin' bad bitches that would rather be dated  
Carolina niggas just glad that he made it  
My money was running late now, now it's happy belated

"Hey, this is the story of a young'n dreamin  
Left his city to see if he could be what he dreamin'  
Big city on his own sh-t  
But every now and then a n-gga get home sick  
Pick up the phone, holla at my partner he telling em, be warned  
A lot of sh-t been changing the time you've been gone  
The streets got meaner, the hoes got growner  
And went and got baby's the day they got a diploma  
Damn, there'll be some n-ggas missing when you fly back  
If you black, they sending you to jail or to Iraq  
Old buddy that we hoop with, with a bad chick and a fly lac  
Anda gold chain, caught him on a merc, tryna buy crack  
Damn homie, sh-t, in high school you was the man homie  
F-ck happened to you,  
Used to beat n-ggas down at the buses after school  
Now you looking like a muthaf-cking fool  
  
[Chorus]  
Say I'll be home for the holidays  
So when you see me, better holla at me  
I gotta get up put this city 'fore it try to trap me  
I gotta leave, I wish I could stay  
But I'll be home for the holidays  
And to those that I used to know  
From way before, keep your head up  
Come lets get this bread up  
Girl, I gotta go, wish I could stay  
But I'm coming hme for the holidays  
  
[J. Cole - Verse 2]  
This is a story bout some puppy love  
But at the time boy, I was feeling like this must be love  
Although now I'm on my grown sh-t  
She mad as hell, a n-gga still get home sick  
I was fresh up off a scholarship  
Dressed like a black man in college sh-t  
Got a little knowledge now I'm following the politics  
But I still gotta holla at my old chick  
So sweet, so thick, girl pick up your phone, it's me  
She said ""we aint homies no more""  
You go to college and you act like you don't know me no more  
Girl, we got history semester seem so long  
The last time I seen ya baby you aint have no clothes on  
So if history repeats itself  
When I get home, girl it's on, you aint gone need ya belt  
Or your pants or your drawers, then we hit the rewind  
Just don't give it up in the meantime  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[J. Cole - Verse 3]  
Man I reminisce on them school days  
I know you know them act a fool days  
That missed the bus then hit the blunt and go to school blazed  
That trying to get laid so I gotta stay fly  
But a n-gga had a shot you'd have thought that's where the bulls play  
Wished this freshman could used a little Kool-aid  
Crushing on them upper clansmen but it was tool late  
Buddy she was dating he had the freshest shoes  
But the n-gga was graduated but he never made two a's  
Hey if you're listening we got in to school  
But who will pay our tuition man  
These n-ggas crazy  
One year cost about the same as a Mercedes (benz)  
Four years cost white crib and a baby  
Ay maybe this aint for me  
If only I could be Lebron with the strength to leave  
The worst part about growing up man the shit just aint for free  
Maybe I can be someone people pay to see  
And maybe I should move up outta here to the place to be  
To get from a to z ay what you think I'm crazy  
If I told you one day that Imma sign with jay-z  
And will I make it I guess we gotta wait and see

[Verse 1: J. Cole]  
Visionary play your position, no missionary  
But yet I pack Gospel in the quotes I spoke  
You listening to the most high like the Pope on dope  
Now picture that  
My poetry's deep now fish for that  
Only real n-ggas catch something, phoney n-ggas fail  
Sh-t you gotta feel like it's only read in braille  
Both did the crime but his homie didn't tell  
So he f-cking b-tches while he sitting lonely in a cell  
Thinking well, what the hell I been on  
They gave a n-gga five then they threw another ten on  
By the time I'm back on the streets like a bachelor  
I gotta play the clubs like an old ass woman  
Life is a movie, pick your own role  
Climb your own ladder or you dig your own hole  
Sit around crying that's like sitting round dying  
You wanna touch the sky b-tch you figure out flying  
  
[Chorus:]  
N-gga how high, so high that I could touch the sky  
How sick, so sick that I could f-ck yo' b-tch  
N-gga please, my squad stack plenty of G's  
And if your girl like to smoke we got plenty of trees  
  
N-gga how high, so high that I could touch the sky  
How sick, so sick that I could f-ck yo' b-tch

[Verse 2: J. Cole]  
Hey, as the troubles of the world unfurl  
My n-ggas hit the trees like squirrels  
Tryna get a nut with your girl  
Think I need to quit trying 'fore some n-gga out there try to hit mine  
Karma for the karma sutra  
A lot calmer when the ganja's through ya  
You need ya armour cause them n-ggas out here tryna shoot ya  
Kinda crucial, police piranha, gon snatch you out that Honda  
For stashing that marijuana  
Yes, ya honour, I feel ashamed  
I broke the law but look I'll never smoke or steal again  
In your courtroom wylin' out, I don't mean to keep smiling  
But right now I'm high enough to probably steal a plane  
Man, just look at me, what if I couldn't read?  
Would you throw the book at me  
What if I'm feeling sad, am I supposed to look happy  
It's been a long time coming  
Tell my n-gga roll me up something  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[J. Cole:]  
No I don't smoke, maybe once in a blue  
When the tention gets thick than there's nothing to do  
Through the windows of my soul, open the blind  
My eyes get shut but I open my mind  
  
How high, la la la la  
How high, hey hey hey  
How high, yeah yeah yeah yeah  
How high, la la la la

Is that a shot that you threw little man?  
I understand, you frustrated career ain't going how you planned  
Make it worse, you're friends, now when they talk rap  
All you hear is ""J Cole this"" and ""J Cole that""  
It must be hard for your projects to take all that  
I know your weak heart gotta break off that  
Boy, look, Cole World this is your worst fear  
I'm burning you n-ggas and I'm only in first gear  
I'm serving you n-ggas this is only the first beer  
12 months from now, you'll be having the worst year  
No tears for the haters, I'm still counting money  
Cole ain't dropping, that's real f-cking funny  
Grade A dummy, sleeping on a n-gga raps  
Something like a mummy  
But I'm a wake yo' ass up  
Something like your mommy on school day

Last year we killed the game  
And left y'all browsing for the clues  
Old niggas out here searching for that fountain of the youth  
Money talks and hoes say it's... point of view  
Don't make me act a fool like Malcolm before the suit  
How can you justify, I testified and there's proof in it  
Through out the years, she'd tears and spill truths  
Somehow they love a nigga better  
When he talk about is loot  
Chain like a kaleidoscope, see light through a wider scope  
And for I know this necklace really represents the news  
Still I hit the jeweler, how much racks to make me cooler  
I just play the game homie, I ain't making rules up  
Started from the bottom, same way you lace your shoes up  
So if I'm blowing cake, just blame it on the place I grew up  
Where niggas had nothing but dreams and television  
Got no plans of seeing hella prison  
You can tell I'm living, right  
I'm a fool  
Never said I'm living right  
Such a fool, for you!  
  
Boy you a fool, boy you a fool

... debt me, and my mama dared me  
Drowning in the pool  
The first to go to college  
They say knowledge is the truth  
But these hoes on campus, make a young nigga drool  
So we party skip class, get ass and talk cool  
Meanwhile she back home work hard  
I use that as my few  
So I finally graduated,  
But I'm sad to say it, I ain't learn a fucking thing  
Except the game and how to play it  
I'm a fool, no... on my shoes  
No cuts out on prove  
So fuck y'all reviews  
She told me Cole I love you roll with you before the riches  
But you way too educated to be calling women bitches  
And calling brothers niggas  
Pardon if I cross the line  
But all the time thought you was different than  
All them other niggas  
I responded to her please don't put me on a pedestal  
Cause I know better  
And I'm still a fool

Niggas so thirsty it irks me  
You keep on putting bitches over money but that ain't my cup of tea though  
Nah nigga, the game is to get  
A bunch of paper just to change your fucking neighbors and shit  
I swear if niggas put half  
Of what they put in chasing ass into a craft  
By now you'd be famous and rich  
But I get it, you rather lay with a bitch  
While you play with her pussy, and let her play with your dick,  
She thinking she got a first round pick  
She thinking bout all the things she can get  
She thinking you got a range for a whip  
And a fly ass cribbo, but it's not that simple cause  
All you got is a phone full of bitches, and they just like her  
Meanwhile I'm stacking paper up, my word  
Had more hoes coming than a bus driver  
Got a full grown woman wanna fuck my word, wanna ride my nouns  
Let her suck my verbs aye  
  
Ill take it, baby I'll take it  
Why I'm starin' at you cause I'm picturing you naked  
Know whats on your mind embrace it, do not fake it  
Tonight is what you make it, take it do not waste it  
Take a shot you not wasted, look in the blocks with mind play?  
I'm in a small ass town with a superstar chick  
This is superstar dick  
Girl, how could you not taste it?

This for my niggas that was tossin' the graves

"Momma I just killed a man  
My body still trembling can you feel my hand  
Don't she'd no tears, it won't be long before they find out it was me momma  
This may be the last time you see me free ma  
Don't spend it cryin'  
You did your best, me I was blessed, know you were stressed tryin'  
To keep me out the streets, me ducking police  
Tryin' not to make a peek to wake you up out your sleep  
A drunk and high fool  
Skip a class, fluncking high school  
I know you taught me better, somehow I never learned  
Said I was playing with fire, somehoe I never burned  
You tried to set me straight, somehow I never permed  
You tried to show me right but somehow I never turned  
Lost in a cloud of marijuana, are you sane dummy  
Dry your face mommy, your not to blame for me  
See I'm a man, I gotta take whatever came for me  
At times I wonder 'bout my father  
Would it change for me if he was around?  
Would I still be running round with the lowlife's  
Bum ass n-ggas no jobs, no life  
Seen them n-ggas killed for no price  
I watched his life flash before his eyes like a strobe light  
I pulled the trigger momma  
Tryna be hard, I aint mean to kill the n-gga momma  
But what's done is done  
I'm on the run, I live my life like a movie now it's way too realer  
Who woulda thought your baby boy woulda grew up to be a killer  
  
Yeh, now I'm a killer  
Guess I'm a killer  
They got me in here with the killers  
Yeah I mean the killers  
  
I wonder what's in store for me  
Lately been stressing, pray for blessings, hope that there's more for me  
Than just a simple life  
N-ggas that I used to hoop with is doing triple life  
Gave up the jump shot  
Work on the john shot  
Who woulda thought I used to block this n-ggas lay ups  
Now he's in a cell layed up  
I wish you well, stay up  
Like insomniacs  
This life can make a n-gga fold like a laundry mat  
I sip this cognac though to ease my brain from all this pain  
And so that I react slow, in this fast world  
Slow n-ggas, fast girls  
Hoes give up ass while these ho n-ggas hold triggers  
Blast on 'em  
Hold up that old checker flag for 'em  
Chalk lines by the do not park sign  
It's deep, all these cold hearted n-ggas holding heat  
I'd rather blast before they steal a n-gga  
Tell 'em now boy, don't make me turn into a killer  
  
Yeah, into a killer  
Don't make me turn into a killer  
Yeah, to a killer, yeh yeh  
  
To those who had love for me in the past  
Who woulda thought time would fly by so fast  
I remember back in class we used to make believe  
Like it was draft day  
Swore that we would make the league, be rich  
Saturday morning had to rake the leaves, awww shit  
Watch how they pile up  
Seem like a mile up  
I was the blisters on my hand than I dial up my best friend  
Skating ring is where we headed tonight  
And if a n-gga disrespect, yes we ready to fight  
In retrospect that shit seemed petty  
At the time, the shit was heavy  
Cause life was all about your name  
You had to scrap with any n-gga that would call you lame  
Ashamed no doubt, so many n-ggas go they brains blown out  
Snatched a n-gga chain and he got his name rolled out in obituaries  
Another body in a cemetary  
Another young n-gga in the penetentiary  
And he don't give a f-ck no missionary  
Rap visionary, paint a picture n-gga pictionary  
Tell you what it is, I'm a dictionary  
I knew a n-gga that threw his d-ck in every chick in every city that he went
to  
Went hard like the rent do  
Till he met the wrong bitch, man just came home ex-convict  
And he stay on with that thriller

That's when I ran into this chick I went to college with  
Yeah back when a nigga was on scholarship  
Was in a rush but I still stopped to holla, shit  
That's the least I owed her cause I tried to hit  
On the first night, nah I ain't proud of it  
I boned her in my dorm room and kicked her out of it  
And I never called back, how thoughtfuless  
Now I'm standing in the streets tryna politic with her  
In her mind she calling me a misogynist nigga  
On some Bobby Brown shit my prerogative  
Nigga is to hit and never commit  
Now realizing when I hit she never forgets  
So every time I ignore the telephone call  
Saying I'll hit her back knowing I'm never gon' call  
She was hurting  
Now she staring dead in my face she was smirking

You ain't worth shit, nigga""

But it's just a nigga God invented  
The best out, foolish pride'll make you not admit it  
Word, this shit ain't vibe nigga, why you noddin' with it?  
The hate in your blood can't stop your soul from vibin' with it  
Now you all conflicted cause my flows is wicked  
And my hoes is thicker and all of yours is pickin' me  
'Cause they know a star when they see a star, nigga  
Ain't even got to fuck him to know he a raw nigga  
I got her in my bedroom, but cheer up, nigga  
You saved so many hoes, you a hero nigga!  
Medal of honor, I'm feelin' on top like Pac  
When he slept with Madonna  
Hey, this is death before dishonor  
Get arrested and forget to tell my mama  
She got enough to stress about  
My nigga gonna get me out  
Then we hit the club with the thugs and the liquors  
No criminal record but I'm makin' criminal records  
Isn't it ironic? Isn't it iconic?  
Jacket so expensive you wouldn't even try on it  
But it fit me perfect, I purchase it if I want it  
The city on my shoulder, so no girl, you can't cry on it  
When you make a list of the greatest aye, am I on it?  
Maybe not yet but bitch I got the clock set  
It goes tick-tock, game on lock  
Sun gon' shine but the rain won't stop  
Oh no!  
  
If I should die before I wake

There's so much pain on my brain I gotta jot it out  
But as of late nigga, it aint been shit to pout about  
I turn up the news, my blues seem petty  
Cause my view of the city is incredible with no album out  
I'm blessed nigga, I'm blessed  
When I'm all alone these words just flow out of my chest  
Turn 'em into poems, they worship, I'm the best  
And though I'm taking long, they f-ck with me none the less  
Yeah, enough sleeping, I put you niggas to rest  
The only one saying shit is like a nigga got tourettes, (chyeah)  
Unimpressed with you niggas  
You the shit only cause I digested you niggas  
But I digress, boy you bout as G as a f-cking tie dye vest  
And your wifey is a bird even in her Prada dress  
Want a nigga like me to come and get her out her nest (out her nest)  
Like come and kick it with a nigga on his way to the top  
  
Won't stop, won't stop  
Hey, don't stop

"Allow me to set the scene first  
This little n-gga no older than 17 in a Martin Luther King shirt  
Walking down the mean merc where the fiends lurk  
And the same dirt'll find a n-gga  
Even if you tryna get that clean work  
He caught eyes with a bad bitch in a jean skirt  
She gave him a mean smurk, he smiled back  
  
He remember this man that hit that shit a while back  
He met her, f-cked her, never dialled back  
How n-ggas do? He kept it moving, couldn't wait to get home  
Report card for his mother couldn't wait to get shown  
Straight A's as usual, his momma would smile  
Youngest child, college bound  
Knew his momma was proud  
Cause he was headed out the hood  
He promised himself one day he'd get her out for good  
That made him smile  
The favourite child, but damn, fate is foul  
Drive by, stray bullets that laid him out  
On the pavement fading out  
Now he bleeding thinking, God, man, you couldn't wait a while  
My momma struggling who gon save her now, huh?  
Now he fading out thinking God, you couldn't wait a while?

Yeah  
Fresh off the motherf-cking broadcast  
And I'm here, fuego nigga  
Yeah, hey, uh, it's happening fast  
Yeah, uh  
  
[Verse:]  
I told niggas on the low, but they ain't hear it though  
Boy that man in the mirror is a miracle  
Hey wipe your face, momma told you no more tears would flow  
We eating better than we was a few years ago  
Send you Western Union on my pay day, a week later it's May day  
So you returned the favor, we stayed afloat like some sailors  
Bill collectors blowing us up, the couldn't fade us  
Bitch I made straight A's, go 'head, try and degrade us, haters  
But this one's funny: man one year later I was on them phones  
Collecting money, a lesson for me: everybody's got a story dog  
Unfortunately learned I can't do nothing for you dog  
I'm trying to run the whole game like a morning jog  
With hits like a porno blog  
Not hopping out to shower to make ten dollars an hour  
Ain't judging though, to each his own  
You pay your bills and raise your kids inside a decent home  
More power to you, but a message to you f-ck niggas  
I hope your kids grow up and never wanna f-ck with you  
This punk nigga knocked up two hoes at the same time  
And told this nigga they was lying dog, they ain't mine  
That's cold blooded but ain't nothing new  
Same old, f-ck it though, what's up with you?  
If you made it this far listening without skipping  
Then I gotta show love, don't worry I'm just venting  
The late night thoughts of a nigga on a mission  
And I rock my girl to sleep in missionary position  
Tuck that ass in and then I went and grabbed a pen  
And now you have it, words flowing like magic, it's truly accurate  
You niggas posing like some hoes up in a beauty pageant!  
Nobody touching me, it's like I got the cooties rapping  
Remember when we called niggas African booty scratchers?  
Yeah that was random, but man, so is life  
You grab your needle, grab your thread, and hope you sew it right  
I find myself fiendin' for a spot to go at night  
With the liquor flowing steady and the hoes polite  
The fast lane makes me reminisce on slower life  
The unabomber, bitch I'm blowing up over night (Boom!)  
  
[Outro:]  
Hey, yo, it's happening fast  
I say it's happening fast  
All the drama that I had to get past  
Will it last? Or will it pass?  
Just as quick as it came  
Hoes knowing my name  
Dog, welcome to fame  
I pray to God we don't change  
But even if you don't  
Most niggas look at you strange  
But I guess I can't complain (Hey)  
Hey man it's happening fast  
I say it's happening fast

As I do so well  
  
[Verse 1]  
Wasn't nothin' like that  
Man, it wasn't nothin' like that first, time  
She was in my math class  
Long hair, brown skin with the fat ass  
Sat beside me, used to laugh, had mad jokes  
The teacher always got mad so we passed notes  
It started off so innocent  
She had a vibe and a nigga started diggin' it  
I was a youngin' straight crushin' tryna play this shit cool  
But a nigga couldn't wait to get to school  
Cause when I seen 'em thighs on her and them hips on her and them lips on her  
Got me daydreaming, man what  
I'm thinkin' how she rides on it, if she sits on it, if she licks on it  
Make it hard for me to stand up  
As time goes by, attractions getting deep and  
Wet dreaming thinkin' that I'm smashin' but I'm sleepin'  
I want it bad, and I ain't never been obsessed before  
She wrote a note that said ""You ever had sex before?""  
Damn  
  
[Hook]  
And I ain't never did this before, no (x8)  
  
[Verse 2]  
I wrote back and said, ""Of course I had sex before,"" knowing I was frontin'  
I said, ""I'm like a pro, baby,"" knowing I was stuntin'  
But if I told the truth I knew I'd get played out, son  
Hadn't been in pussy since the day I came out one  
But, she don't know that, so she done wrote back and told me  
""Oh you a pro homie? Well I want you to show me  
My mama gone for the weekend  
So Saturday baby we can get to freakin'""  
That's when my heart start racing and my body start sweatin'  
Baby, you done woke my lil' man up  
I'm thinking how that body look naked when you laying on the bed  
Teacher, please don't make me stand up  
I wrote back like ""Yeah, baby, sound like a plan""  
Still trying to play it cool, sound like the man  
But I was scared to death my nigga, my stomach turned  
Talking shit knowing damn well I was a virgin  
Fuck  
  
[Hook]  
  
[Verse 3]  
You know that feeling when you you finna bone for the first time  
I'm hoping that she won't notice it's my first time  
I'm hoping that my shit is big enough to fuck with  
And most of all I'm praying, ""God don't let me bust quick""  
I'm watching pornos trying to see just how to stroke right  
Practice putting condoms on, how it go right  
I'm in her crib, now a nigga palms sweatin'  
With a pocket full of rubbers and an erection  
That's when my hands start touching and her face start blushing  
And a nigga roll over on top  
And then she get my pants unbuckled and her hands start rubbing  
On me, ooh girl don't stop  
It's time for action: pull out the condoms real smooth, yeah, just how I
practiced  
But right before I put it in, she flinched and grabbed it and said  
""I wanna get something off my mental  
I can tell you're a pro, but baby be gentle, cause""

Last time I seen you, you was a lil old girl  
I had a crush now we grown and we still so thorough  
Clap for her, work it till you exhausted  
I swear nothing worse than a bad bitch that lost it  
Brains off the chain, smart mouth with a dumb ass  
Goddamn your ex-man is a dumb ass  
When you was leaving, did he put up a fight  
Was he stressing you, wasn't fucking you right  
Well one man's trash is another man's treasure  
One man's pain is another man's pleasure  
One damn thing you can't change is the weather

Nope, I'm peeking at your ass, winking at your ass

Hold up, loud packs like I got cancer  
Choking on them white boys make a Black Panther  
Love my women with high heels and high standards  
And only cheat on my broad if I run out of answers  
I got that vicious flow, Moncler winter coat  
I ain't superstitious I make all these broads split my pole  
You dig it, this shit ain't for beginners  
I'm something like a fetus, I'm not quite kidding  
And there's something you ain't seeing like I block your vision  
Like my Remy with no juice, you a lot like Bishop

Yeah grew up with killers, I didn't know they was killers  
We was just together man, playing mega-man on sega man

Yeah real black queen  
If I had a genie, I wish that she ain't struggle no more  
Yall wouldn't have to go to sleep with all the roaches if she wasn't so poor  
You told me when you came to my house  
This shit was like a timeout from reality  
One night you asked me what I'm crying about  
'Cuz you was staying over for the weekend  
I woke up from out my sleep  
When I heard mama and my stepfather beefin'  
I don't know if he been drinkin'  
But I know this shit got loud and I heard rumbling from struggling  
And rolling on the ground  
Could never get used to that sound  
My mama saying get off me  
My tears is tumbling now  
I wish that you never saw me  
'Cuz I, felt like a coward, so powerless I was only 12  
I wish I would'be bust through that door my fucking self  
And grab the Glock right off the fucking shelf  
If nothing else scared a nigga shitless  
There goes two of my wishes  
Forever scarred, determined to get some heart  
No matter how big the nigga, no matter how small you are  
Fast-forward to our older years  
Two different paths  
You used to talk to me about college but that shit didn't last  
Waste of potential, getting cash, what could I say?  
So tired of not having things, you never see it my way  
Too proud to fold  
You're demise  
One day to my surprise, my nigga called me, told me you just caught a body
twice your size  
I asked if it was self defense, he said it was defense of pride  
And that they trying to give you ten, but if you lucky you'll do five damn  
Not my nigga  
The same one that told me that things always get better  
Just trust me, don't cry my nigga  
The news call him a killa, but he my nigga

But now I see my nigga  
That the worlds a lot bigger ever since  
Picked up the paper and they say my nigga Eddie caught a body, I'm convinced

Without substance, something for them to grab on

Next time I'mma flip the script, you know, kick some shit that's gon shock her  
""You so tall what team do u play for?"" No bitch I'm a doctor  
Flow hella proper, Cole never flopped, nah  
Float like a propeller no helicopter shit  
Not stick like a bowlegged chick  
Stick dick to a gold digger, won't give her dollar  
Fuck your nine I'm a whole different caliber  
Nigga say they pop cause they don't fill they collars up  
Read a book get your knowledge up, book a flight get ya mileage up  
Bitch nigga...

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]  
I'mma start off with these four bars  
I'm in a barbie at a sports bar  
I'm rockin' gold balls, whip your ass with this crowbar  
I'm like ""Oh Boy, catch your girl off that rebound""  
Fix her hair up, get her a re-do  
Just my car out that paint shop, so I guess that's a mothafuckin re-coupe  
Let me demonstrate, gotta think about it before I go on a dinner date  
Might eat a rich bitch, yes I got me expensive taste  
Got my pockets on full, stomach on full, gun on full, I got full coverage  
Niggas don't know the full story, I'm smokin on gas, full service  
Money talk, true story, if you don't got none then don't say shit  
Banana clips going ape shit, if you don't make money you don't make sense  
I got gold on my bracelet, got ya girlfriend chasing it  
Bust a nut in her mouth, so now she can baby sit  
  
[Hook:]  
  
[Outro: J Cole]  
This liquor I've been sippin' got me kissing all these models  
And I might not see tomorrow, I might not see tomorrow  
Please don't tell my mom I spent tuition on these bottles  
Just to pay back all these loans man we gon' have to hit the lotto'

[J Cole - Verse 1]  
Just one of them days  
A n-gga feel like flossin'  
A Stone Cold Stunna, victim Steve Austin  
Cool as Drew Breeze, I'm blowing a few G's  
Just to hear them hoes say he's awesome  
He's awful, yeah remember when ya fronted on me  
Pulled up beisde me in that big body and stunted on me  
Or when the bouncer just announced that it was bottle service only  
Then he kicked me out the line, yeah he punted on me  
Well look I'm back b-tch, back with an attitude  
Buying out the bar, cause I feel like this the sh-t I gotta prove  
Last year the cashier told me my card was not approved  
Now I'm tipping the server a hundred to show my gratitude  
Easy, told you I'd be back baby, I guess you aint believe me  
Now I'm living just like the n-ggas you see on tv  
Vip feeling like this club oughta thank me  
I hit the bar just so y'all can see I'm ballin', hd  
  
[Chorus:]  
(It's cost me a lot)  
Big chains, big whips with wood grain  
(It's cost me a lot)  
My God, my watch make momma think someone might rob  
(It's cost me a lot)  
Fast life and till the gas light  
Copped the type of sh-t you couldn't get at half price  
(It's cost me a lot)  
Look but don't touch muthaf-cker, think twice  
(It's cost me a lot)  
  
Now I don't love no material things  
But I'm in love with the feelings they bring  
I got em like damn (how, how, how he do that)  
Damn (how, how, how, how he do that)  
Now I don't love no material things  
But I'm in love with the feelings they bring  
I got em like damn (how, how, how he do that)  
Damn (how, how, how, how he do that)  
  
[J Cole - Verse 2]  
Uh, knee deep in the game, my chain heavy  
Somebody get the pilot and ask ""is the plane ready?""  
To handle all the weight on my shoulders we taking off  
Don't wanna meet Aaliyah but yet I can't take it off  
Cause how I'm supposed to shine without the proper bling  
Remember when I did a show with Waka Flocka Flame  
Felt naked cause the boy rocked bout a dozen chains  
Guess we rock a lot of ice cause we got a lot of pain  
That's 5 hundred years of selling, I'm tryna tell em  
Jacob the Jeweller is cooler now he a felon  
Jay put a stamp on the n-gga but wouldn't nail him  
If he couldn't sell him, so what that tell him huh?  
  
My chain heavy and my b-tches look very thorough  
Must be the money like dealing with the Jerry curl  
White Range, call that Muthaf-cker Larry Bird  
I got em hanging on every word

When n-ggas play tough, wont even smile in mirrors  
And we learn to f-ck hoes off trial and error  
Just a small time n-gga, big city hustle  
Glued to the tv, Jigga, Diddy, Russell  
These were our heroes, strictly for them zero's  
For that Robert Deniro, n-ggas reload on them kilo's  
Dodgin them people,  
Mad at myself cause I done seen some things that I'd rather not tell  
Shawty smole crack and her boyfriend too  
Sometimes he touch her daughter like them boyfriends do  
Pull up to the club where the boys went too  
See that yellow tape and the boys in blue  
A n-gga on a strecther and though I never met ya  
I'm thinking God Bless ya, they city try and get ya  
Man, don't let the city get ya  
F-ck the horoscopes, know the ropes lke a wrestler  
If them bullets wet ya bet ya momma need a tissue  
Your face on the front of our shirts saying we miss ya

I know you only do what's best for me  
But is it cool if we negotiate my destiny  
They always tellin' me it's temporary  
Than why it's feelling like a cemetary  
My dreams aint got no obituaries  
My city hurting and none of us were equiped here  
You heard me say I was ballin'  
I probably make tears  
I'm trying to get clear  
I'm tryna quit fear  
Who wrote the scripts here  
These kids live there whole life just killing time  
Running the race with no finish line  
They tryna noose us with they ropes  
But I'm tryna climb  
I think my foolish pride might become my suicide  
But I aint tryna go, no baby  
And through these lines and quotes you gotta find some hope  
Cause I aint dying  
My words gon' last forever,  
You can hold the treasure  
Look inside you can see a diamond in my mind  
I'm tired of seeing dope fiends, wiping they nose clean  
Is my neighbourhood just a smoke screen  
I think I'm in the [?] I see lo green  
Sons raised by bo queens but there's no kings  
(No kings, no kings)

It seems like n-ggas either feel ya or they try and kill ya  
I face the sky and hope to God aint acting unfamiliar  
You play whatever cards he deal no matter how peculiar  
They tell me that it's God's will, I'm asking God will ya  
Iller a n-gga from artist pain, momma smoking cocaine as it rains out  
Am I to blame, try to stay sane so I came out-side  
Where they rock with them thangs out  
To clear my mind at the same time they blew that boys brains out  
But will it change, it's like n-ggas is free but our minds still in the chains  
Brothers killing eachother, the blood spill it's a shame  
Will it ever slow up  
A lot of n-ggas getting older but they never grow up  
And do they son's like they fathers did and never show up  
Don't even cry about it, just another episode of life  
Watch the season n-gga no re-runs  
The devil buying soul's n-gga no refunds  
Man, don't let the city get ya  
F-ck the horoscopes know the ropes like a wrestler  
If them bullets wet ya bet ya momma need a tissue  
Your face on the front of our shirts screaming we miss ya  
Another day, another song, a mother prays  
Another gone  
But still we play like aint nothing wrong  
Like aint nothing wrong  
Cause aint nothing wrong  
I'm not as fast, I'm not as tall  
But before I pass

Two years later bitch we made it on, onto the Blueprint  
Now how's that for persistence  
Cole World comin', call back up assistance  
Same broads, used to hang up on my walls  
Now they come up out their drawers, how's that for a mistress  
Hell bent, heaven sent, Lord I repent if I ever sinned  
Now I know I ain't the richest, but I still wanna ball  
Put money over bitches but we still underdogs

No I don't know where I'm goin', but I'm goin', now is you comin' with me?

Lookin' for some nookie, I'm tryna scoop me a bad one  
Every verse I spit it just like it could be my last one  
Ever since I got on  
I've been on a mission to fuck the bitches I missed out on  
Ex-cheerleader hollerin' what's up  
Now her nigga beat her, now that's fucked up  
What type of little fuck boy hitter  
Woman baby wouldn't put his hands on a nigga  
I ain't bitter boy that's all you  
Plus I just fucked her 'fore she called you  
Dry your eyes baby, I'll drive you home  
Older hoes sayin', my how you've grown  
I came up, fucked the game up  
Show my momma I'll survive on my own

She gave a nigga mad brain something like the wiz,  
But you see the sad thing fucking with her is,  
The chick ain't even have brains dummy like a bitch,  
  
So I tried to show her,  
About the world and about just who we really are,  
And where we've come and how we still have to go really far,  
Like baby look at how we live broke on the boulevard,  
But all she ever want me to do is unhook her bra,  
And I really want is for her to go down low,  
Before you know it she wet enough to get drowned slow,  
And all the deep shit I was previously down for  
Replaced by freak shit I am currently down for  
  
You see I peeped it pussy is power,  
That proud feeling we get knowing pussy is ours,  
And how it feels to feel that feeling you feeling when you be drilling that
shit,  
Got her sayin' you be killin' that shit  
And all the pain the world caused she be healin' that shit,  
And nah that ain't your girl but you be feelin' that chick,  
And you just want to tell her everything she might need,  
But in the mean time its light please  
  
[Chorus x2]  
Lights please  
Lights please  
Turn off the lights,  
For now everything just seems so right,  
How you make the darkness seem so bright,  
Feeling like thing gon be alright  
  
So now we in the hotel mirrors on the ceiling,  
She say she wanna blow L's I hear her and I'm willing,  
But every time I smoke well a nigga mind gone,  
So that every word I spoke I was tryna put her on,  
But she couldn't hear me,  
  
I told her all about how we been living a lie,  
And that they love to see us all go to prison to die,  
Like baby look at how the show us on the TV screen,  
But all she ever want me to do is unzip her jeans,  
Then all I really want is for her to get on top,  
Before you know it she working jerking it nonstop,  
And all that next shit I was previously talkin',  
Is now that wet shit that I'm currently lost in,  
  
And while that sweat drip I am reminded,  
All the times my brother told me that pussy is blinding,  
I'm finding,  
The more I grow the more y'all seem to stay the same,  
Don't even know the rules but yet y'all trying to play the game,  
And ain't it shameful how niggas blame hoes for giving birth,  
To a baby that took two to make,  
Coward nigga you a fake,  
How you gon look in your sons face and turn you back,  
Then go start another family dog what type of shit is that,  
  
She said it's okay,  
Rubbed my head and told me to relax,  
Laid a nigga down proper like she was recordin' tracks,  
Said I know you wanna change the world but for the night please,  
Just reach over and hit the lights please,

And now I'm flying worldwide, singing rap songs  
Fucking all the bad hoes that I once knew  
And busted nuts for all the times I was shitted on  
See now it was once fuck me, now it's fuck you  
Clearly, now hear me  
Back with a vengeance, hope you niggas feel me

Two chains, two guns, he bipolar  
Two baby mama's, three kids, two Rovers

Hoes off the centerfold, I be going ham at ten

Thinking if it crash, I'll never see your ass again  
Wouldn't that be a shame  
Cause look at all the shit we overcame  
Made it through the falme and never got cremated  
I made it to the fame and never got too jaded

Flash forward it's been year, we're the only ones that made it

Now I know you wonder why this phone lock on  
All this time I've been with ya you aint used to do that

The way you breaking my heart I should sue you for that  
Calling my uncles and my cousins have them do you for that

I'mma pass your classes, I'mma learn your craft  
I'mma fuck your daughters, I'mma burn your flag  
  
Took chances, slow dance with the devil bitch  
Overcomin' the circumstances we hella rich  
Since you all in my business, this what I tell a bitch  
If you ain't fuckin' me, don't fuck with me, this life on the edge  
Green dollars splurged all on embellishments  
My fellowship paid, don't need to cop my fellas shit  
Scoopin' hoes in the party, some Cinderella shit  
Smash for the hell of it, livin' life on the edge  
  
They don't feel my pain  
They'll never feel my pain  
And they'll never play this shit on the radio

Mo Money  
Mo Money Blow, Blow Money, Show Money  
Party Money, Side Ho Money, Dope Money  
New Clothes money from shit that I wrote money  
So much money I don't know who stile from me  
Hard to keep track I'm used to having no money  
Still broke compared to niggas with old money  
I mean the type of niggas that laugh at Hov money  
Billionaires with Petroleum and coal money  
Probably kill themselves if the had Cole money  
Talk shit and I'mma see you like you owe money  
I'm wrapping up the album, fouth quater I'm so money  
I'm over sees looking for trees to grow money  
Peter Popper off robbing people for hope money  
Prostitutes collecting that let me stroke money  
Out up a couple dollars for the liquor store money  
Used to dread the strip club cause I couldn't throw money  
Now the strippers give a nigga the throw for no money  
How mama gonna teach you how to save your money  
When she barely on the boat got stay afloat money  
Blacks always broke cause we don't know money  
Spend it before we get it and could never hold money  
No wallets, nah, we'd rather fold money  
Money control niggas, white man control money  
Laughing like yeah yeah my nigga get your money

"Yeah, hey, wassup girl  
Hey, yeah, uh  
  
Uh, angel eyes, long hair  
I see you cryin', what's wrong there  
He did what? He fucked who?  
We know the story, what's new?  
See I could probably, rush you  
Tell you that he should have loved you  
Take advantage, fuck you  
Tell you I'll do all the shit he wouldn't do  
But the truth is, we all the same  
On different teams, but it's all a game  
The objective, tryna score  
You got a wife, you find a whore  
You fuck her fast, she find her drawers  
Pull up her pants, you find the door  
You drive her home, she mop you off  
You bust again, and drop her off  
Then repeat like an episode  
Why we cheat? I'll never know  
Is it cause we rap? Heavens no  
Lotta niggas rap though, never blow  
A heterosexual, girl you fine, from head to toe  
Could it be cause my father let me know  
That he cheated, and somehow I never told  
I never told  
  
""Hey, you wanna be a man?  
Yeah I wanna be a man.  
A man don't run tellin' mama everything he see.  
I ain't gonna tell.  
Alright then man. You're a man now.  
Okay.""  
  
OK, that's what it is, I see the game  
The hoes come, the seasons change  
The hoes go, we rearrange  
Fuck up her life, she'll never be the same  
The old G's that beat the game  
Forever young, Peter Pan  
Thirty five, still playin', child support, still payin'  
Jugglin', bill payin'  
Been runnin' round, field dayin'  
Wine and dine, meal payin'  
With hopes that she'll land  
The bed and, get wet then, give head then  
You bet man, the same girl who said we just met man  
Game colder than the fuckin' dead man  
One night stands, no best man  
No bridesmaids, or reverends  
Cause Wolverine's depressin', don't wanna be your ex man  
Cause cupid aims and throw the darts  
There go the sparks and broken hearts  
Who wanna build Noah's Ark  
Just to have that shit torn apart  
  
""You know what? I need to talk to you.  
About what?  
I don't think this is, working out for us.  
Why?  
I mean, I need some space. I mean no, I just wanna find myself, that's all.  
What the fuck?!""

"[Chorus:]  
Is the whole world gunning for me, or is it just all in my mind?  
If you want it, come and see me  
I aint got nothing but time  
One day you're gonna set me free  
But first you gotta let me shine  
Niggas aint high as I be  
See, look momma I'm flyin'  
  
To Neverland, Neverland, Neverland  
I'll probably never land  
Neverland, Neverland, noo, I'll never never land  
  
[J Cole - Verse 1]  
Check my fortune cookie, it's that Cole World  
Could that mean it's meant to be?  
So much drive a nigga coulda been a chauffeur  
This life is f-cking with me mentally  
Fake niggas try to act like they a friend to me  
I treat you lames how I see you lames, enemies  
My good girl say they wanna know the inner me  
My bad girl sayin' f-ck all that, enter me  
Double shots, hennessy bring out bad tendencies  
Try to cut something, need a volunteer, Tennessee  
Anything to take my mind off  
I logged on and made them muthaf-ckas sign off  
I got the on my dick they'll never climb off  
I switch watches yet I never took time off (time off)  
I don't know what's worse, fake friends or fake fans  
Both kissing ass for the chance to shake hands and damn  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[J. Cole - Verse 2]  
I'm sorting through this, organised confusion to get my thoughts together  
This shit is sounding like a movie you can watch forever  
I gotta make it to the top, it's either now or never  
These other niggas can't adapt because they not as clever  
The shit they talk is more expensive but I doubt it's better  
She let that nigga make it rain but guess who got it wetter  
Cold World, snow flurries in the hottest weather  
And, so sick they can't fix this with medi-cine  
We at yo door and she gotta let us in  
It's what you want, I whet your appetite  
Cole hit the scene now I'm what everyone rapping like  
Shame you feel you have to bite  
Still aint nobody snapping right  
Pedal to the metal as I'm speeding through the traffic lights  
Bitch I gotta catch a flight, come on already  
Still fight like I'm the underdog, I'm on already  
Got a few niggas we bout to prove wrong, ya'll already already

Fish out of water, yet an official reporter  
Up here, life is a bitch I blow a kiss at her daughter  
In a city where niggas will leave you shit outta order  
So yeah, you heard the news, disturbing news  
Shot a brother in the head, thank the lord he ain't dead  
Was in a coma for months, eyes ain't opened them once  
My nigga visibly stressed in a mess he's smoking his blunt  
What could I say, I can't relate to that  
All I do is pray for that  
This the city god told me, 'go and make it' at

And never got scraps while the devil got fat  
In fact, reparation for niggas in desperation  
Fuck money, get my kid a real education  
Blood money spills, had a real revelation  
Southside make you realize there's still segregation  
Don't wanna preach I'm just thinking out loud  
Sometimes I wanna save the world and I be thinking bout how  
My motive, to lead my niggas to paradise

Bad credit and a school bill  
Middle finger to the bursar  
Finally famous but  
Ain't too much really change with us

Fucked yo bitch, nigga I ain't ask  
She pitched it to me like Sosa (Oh God)  
What the fuck was I s'posed to?  
Deny that, rather try that, but I never fly that  
Keep hoes bi-coastal  
And they buy postals, ain't shit for free

Sit vip, get a sip for free  
Later on she'll be sippin' me, literally

Minus six shots, but it's still this hot  
Thirty grand and that's just for the wristwatch

You fight for a nigga like I fight for you  
Like I fight temptations every night for you  
And though I slip, only girl in my life is you

In time, sparks will fly

We live through the ups and the downs

You gotta dream like you never seen obstacles  
Chasing obscene profits so we ain't stopping for the red lights  
Look in my rear view all I see is n-ggas headlights  
Catch me if you can hoe  
They try and sack me and I scramble  
Look up in the sky you'll see exactly where I am bo  
Hey, don't you see me man?  
Making my wishes come true with no genie man  
I got the keys to my beamer with no Beanie Man  
I'm on these rich n-ggas ass no bikini man  
I bring the real to the day the Lord free me man  
Never imagined that the kids would wanna be me man  
Eh, could it be that I give the hopeless broke kids, hope  
Caught me walking through the mall, looking like he seen a ghost  
Silly head to approach, what's up young blood  
Aint it strange, a year ago today I was counting change  
Yeah hopping trains up in New York city  
Though I gotta thank God cause if you weren't with me  
Than I surely woulda died  
You can throw the fork in me  
This my New Years resolution, dawg  
No more Pork in me

It's young Simba, I'm ballin' til the buzzard blow  
You try and kick the shit I kick you gon stub your toe  
Boy that's just how tough I go  
See this is my life work

Man, I rap so vicious but I talk so politely  
Never met a baby momma, momma who don't like me  
Met a couple baby fathers though they wanna fight me  
I hit her til she snooze, like the news n-gga nightly  
Send her back to you when she no longer excites me  
No she bitter with this n-gga  
Cause he aint quite me  
One things for certain baby, you are a wifey  
Two things for f-cking sure  
I am not the husband thoguh  
So run back to him while you still can  
He sticking with his wife and kid, yeah that's a real man  
I was ashamed all along and I still am  
We let the lust interupt something real, damn  
Girl we grown so you gotta play your own position  
I wouldn't say that you a hoe, just made a hoe decision  
Eh, you can blame it on the liquor like a prohibitions

So at ease with that broke shit  
We all tryna get a dollar boy, no sh-t  
You know I feel ya pain, that's why I slang this hope sh-t

I got some sh-t I'd like to get off my chest  
I spill out my soul, I spit out my stress  
And can I spit out my stress?  
It's the feeling in the air you bout to drop a real classic  
He said Cole, ""a lil birdy told me on the low you got an Illmatic""  
Nobody touching Nas n-gga it's more like Villematic  
These fayettnam tales be paying off well  
What story is my audio theatre gon tell  
I know my debut will ship, but is it gon sell?  
I guess it's in God's hand's  
I make the type of pieces that make Jesus say God damn  
That's for your non-believers  
I'm the truth only time will teach ya  
And f-ck the haters probably never love they momma's neither  
Old bitter-ass sit around in middle class homes with computers on hating on
the newest song  
While you was browsing I was taking out them student loans  
Trying to do this sh-t better than the n-ggas we grew up on  
Name a f-cking song I aint threw up on  
Talk is cheap, it's like ya'll grew up in a Jewish home!  
Pardon the stereotype  
But ya'll giving me mixed feeling's like you married a white woman  
One minute I'm over-rated, next minute I'm the saviour  
You hate it before you played it, I already forgave ya  
For bullsh-ttin' and the n-gga Cole spittin' it real  
Wrote this line on a plane got flown straight from the Ville  
To Miami, where the same time last year  
I was broker than you, I just wanna make that clear  
Cause now I'm dealing with money I've never seen before  
And Rnb b-tches want me, that was just dreams before  
Now do I give in to the temptation I'm facin'  
The thought of losing a good woman keep me from chasin'  
But I'm just a man, at time's the timing is wrong  
Plus my d-ck is like a man with a mind of it's own  
But I'm trying to be strong, remind myself she ain't about sh-t  
These hoes the same, all that change is the outfit  
Looking for chesse on some mouse sh-t  
Suck a n-gga, f-ck a n-gga, than go run they mouth quick  
Rappers took a vacation I came over the house sit  
You want change, this that ""between the seats in your couch"" sh-t  
The f-ck you thought, I lost it  
All that flame on my name would get exhausted  
Au contraire my n-gga they all ears  
Sit back, enjoy the ride it's finna be a long year, yeah  
It's finna be a long year, yeah

How you hating on a nigga that wanted it more than you?  
I ran through them spots with you and f-cked the same bitches too  
And just because I rocked with you I scrapped with them niggas too  
Came back for them niggas too, aint no trappin' nigga it's true

Would you look at that, I came back for her  
Just to give it to you, like you asked for it  
Man that thing in them jeans too fat for her  
It rebounds so I caught it off the backboard  
I told her, baby girl come here  
Know I run the town even when I aint from there  
And I brag hardly but just to show up at this party I made  
What your nigga make in one year, thats unfair but  
So is life, take a chance roll a dice  
Money can't buy you love cause it's over priced  
Don't over think just hope it's right

This Hennessey, is gon be the death of me  
  
And I always thought that you havin my child was our destiny  
But I can't even vibe wit you sexually  
Cause every time that I try you will question me  
Say ""you fuckin them girls, disrespecting me?  
You don't see how your lies are affecting me?  
You don't see how our life was supposed to be?  
And I never let a nigga get that close to me!  
And you ain't cracked up to what you was supposed to be!  
You always gone! You always be where them hoes would be! ""  
And it's the first time she ever spilled her soul to me!  
I fucked up and I know it G  
I guess it's bittersweet poetry

"Damn, here we go again  
Common passed on this beat  
I made it to a jam  
Now everything I'm not, made me everything I am  
  
Damn, here we go again  
People talkin' shit, but when the shit hit the fan  
Everything I'm not, made me everything I am  
  
I'll never be picture-perfect Beyonce'  
Be light as Albi or black as Chauncey  
Remember him from blackstreet  
He was as black as the street was  
I'll never be as laid back as this beat was  
I never could see why people'll reach a  
Fake-ass versad that they couldn't keep up  
Ya see how I creeped up?  
Ya see how I played a big role in Chicago like Queen Latifah?  
I never rock a mink coat in a winter time like Killa Cam  
Or rock some mink boots in the summertime like Will.I.Am  
Let me know if you feel it man  
Cause everything I'm not, made me everything I am  
  
Damn, here we go again  
Everybody sayin' what's not for him  
Everything I'm not, made me everything I am  
  
Damn, here we go again  
People talkin' shit, but when the shit hit the fan  
Everything I'm not, made me everything I am  
  
And I'm back to tear it up  
Haters, start your engines  
I hear 'em gearin' up  
People talkin' so much shit about me at barbershops  
They forget to get their haircut  
Okay fair enough, the streets is flarin' up  
Cause they want gun-talk, or I don't wear enough  
Baggy clothes, Reebok's, or A-di-dos  
Can I add that he do spaz out at his shows  
So say goodbye to the N-double-A-C-P award  
Goodbye to the India Arie award  
They'd rather give me the nigga-please award  
But I'll just take the I-got-a-lot a-cheese award  
  
Damn, here we go again  
Everything I'm not, made me everything I am  
  
Damn, here we go again  
People talkin' shit, but when the shit hit the fan  
Everything I'm not, made me everything I am  
  
I know that people wouldn't usually rap this  
But I got the facts to back this  
Just last year, Chicago had over six hundred caskets  
Man, killin's some wack shit  
Oh, I forgot, 'cept for when niggas is rappin'  
Do you know what it feel like when people is passin'?  
He got changed over his chains, a block off Ashlin  
I need to talk to somebody, pastor  
The church want time, so I can't afford to pay  
The slip on the door, cause I can't afford to stay  
My 15 seconds up, but I got more to say  
That's enough Mr. West, please no more today  
  
Damn, here we go again  
Everybody sayin' what's not for him  
Everything I'm not, made me everything I am  
  
Damn, here we go again  
People talkin' shit, but when the shit hit the fan  
Everything I'm not, made me everything I am

First Verse:  
  
Last night me and my dogs was hanging out  
Tired of being cramped up in the house  
We were simply celebrating life  
Off from work today, so it's all right  
But all those ups and downs, turned me in a twist  
Started dancing with this model chick  
Then every record became our favorite song  
And that is all that I remember  
  
Chorus:  
  
Cuz I had one too many drinks  
And ended up at the Embassy  
With this pretty little thing, from Memphis Tennessee  
It was a one night extravaganza  
  
Second Verse:  
  
When I woke up from last night's ""salvatry""  
Baby doll was laying next to me  
Shoes and clothes was scattered every where  
I got dress and got up out of there  
But not before I call for me a cab  
Hung over from all the drinks I had  
And now I'm telling my story to you  
Every thing that I remember  
  
Repeat Chorus: 2x  
  
Bridge:  
  
Extravaganza, Extravaganza  
Only was an extravaganza  
Yes, it was  
The things that I remember  
  
Kanye West's Rap:  
(And I remember)  
Being at the bar  
Trying to ask what that Hpyno hit fo'  
Knowing that I can't afford to get mo'  
Here's a broke nigga trick  
Buy one bottle and sip slow  
Or, or leave the club now  
Do like I did  
Come back when you get dough  
A fish stick nigga  
Now we messing with lobsters  
We messing with Grammies  
We messing with Oscars  
You messing with that dranky drank  
Plus you puffing on the stanky stank  
In the morning, you g'on draw a blank  
The hotel said that y'all was on one  
My girl wasn't on shit  
I picked the wrong one  
Steady talking about I ain't like them other girls  
Well tonite, I'm trying to find them other girls  
Bring they own rubber girl  
Neva meet 'cha mother girl  
You know they love it, when you love them  
And they tell they friends, girrrllllll

"This is family business  
And this is for the family that can't be with us  
And this is for my cousin locked down, know the answer's in us  
That's why I spit it in my songs so sweet  
Like a photo of your granny's picture  
Now that you're gone it hit us  
Super hard on Thanksgiving and Christmas, this can't be right  
Yeah you heard the track I did man, this can't be life  
Somebody please say grace so I can save face  
And have a reason to cover my face  
I even made you a plate, soul food, know how Granny do it  
Monkey bread on the side, know how the family do it  
When I brought it why had guard have to look all to it?  
As kids we used to laugh  
Who knew that life would move this fast?  
Who knew I'd have to look at you through a glass?  
And look, tell me you ain't did it, you ain't did it  
And if you did, then that's family business  
  
And I don't care 'bout (all the, all the diamond rings, diamond rings)  
They don't mean a thing (all, all, all the things)  
All these fancy things  
I tell you that all (all the glitter) I'm waiting for  
Now all I know I know all these things

Come on, let's take a family Grammy picture  
Abby, remember when they ain't believe in me?  
Now she like ""See, that's my cousin on TV""  
Now, we gettin' it and we gon' make it

I can't deny it, I'm a straight rider  
But when we get together be electric slidin'  
Grandma, get 'em shook up  
Aw naw, don't open the photo book up  
I got an Aunt Ruth that can't remember your name  
But I bet them Polaroids'll send her down memory lane  
You know that one auntie, you don't want to be rude  
But every holiday nobody eatin' her food  
And you don't want to stay there 'cause them your worst cousins  
Got roaches at their crib like them your first cousins  
Act like you ain't took a bath with your cousins  
Fit three in the bed while six of y'all  
I'm talkin' 'bout three by the head and three by the leg  
But you ain't have to tell my girl I used to pee in the bed  
  
Rain, rain, rain go away  
Let the sun come out and all the children say  
Rain, rain, rain go away  
Let the sun come out and all the children say  
  
I woke up early this mornin' with a new state of mind  
A creative way to rhyme without usin' nines and guns  
Keep your nose out the sky, keep your heart to God  
And keep your face to the risin' sun  
All my niggas from the Chi, that's my family dog  
And my niggas ain't my guys, they my family dog  
I feel like one day you'll understand me dog  
You can still love your man and be manly dog  
You ain't got to get heated at every house warmin'  
Sittin' here, grillin' people like George Foreman  
Why Uncle Ray and Aunt Shiela always performin'?  
The second she storms out then he storms in  
Y'all gon' sit down, have a good time this reunion  
And drink some wine like Communion  
And act like everything fine and if it isn't  
We ain't lettin' everybody in our family business

Do you think about me now and then?  
Cause I'm coming home again  
  
I met this girl when I was 3 years old  
And what I loved most she had so much soul  
She said ""Excuse me lil homey, I know you don't know me  
But, my name is Windy and I like to blow trees""  
And from that point I never blow her off  
Niggas come from out of town, I like to show her off  
They like to act tough, she like to tow 'em off  
And make 'em straighten up their hat cause she know they soft  
And when I grew up she showed me how to go downtown  
In the nighttime her face lit up, so astounding  
I told her in my heart is where she'll always be  
She never messed with entertainers cause they always leave  
She said it felt like they walked and drove on me  
Knew I was gang affiliated, got on TV and told on me  
I guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me  
She said ""'Ye, keep making that keep making that platinum and gold for me!""  
  
I'm coming home again  
Do you think about me now and then?  
Do you think about me now and then?  
Cause I'm coming home again  
Do you think about me now and then?  
Do you think about me now and then?  
Cause I'm coming home again  
Maybe we can start again  
  
But if you really cared for her  
Then you wouldn't have never hit the airport to follow your dreams  
Sometimes I still talk to her, but when I talk to her  
It always seems like she talking 'bout me  
She said, ""You left your kids, and they just like you  
They want to rap and make soul beats just like you  
But they just not you"" and I just got through  
Talking 'bout what niggas tryna do: just not new  
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong  
I guess you never know what you got 'til it's gone  
I guess that's why I'm here and I can't come back home  
And guess when I heard that? When I was back home  
Every interview I'm representing you, making you proud  
Reach for the stars so if you fall, you land on a cloud  
Jump in the crowd, spark your lighters, wave 'em around  
If you don't know by now, I'm talking 'bout Chi-Town!

Do you think about me now and then?

I be a billionaire if I could get a dollar  
For all the bullshit that I hear a day, I did it  
  
The storm is on the horizon  
I'm standing here alone  
Got a pistol on my hip  
And it's gonna be some shit  
If you want it then bring it on  
See I'm a motherfuckin' soldier  
And I'mma be here till it's done  
And when they asking who I'm is, shit  
You just tell them that I'm the one (One, one, one)  
Tell them that I'm the one (One, one, one)  
Tell them that I'm the one  
  
Treat the back seat like a sofa bed  
Break bread with my niggas, call it profit share  
This some good shit, but it get better  
And yeah my bitch cold, nigga thin sweater  
Like my verse suede and the beat leather  
Just tryin' to stay above sea level  
When my nigga went to jail, I said, ""Free Gucci""  
I done bought so much shit, I should get free Gucci  
Bought my baby momma anaconda bags  
I shouldn't have bought it all  
I should've went and cut the grass  
Snake ass niggas in my fuckin' face  
Bring your girl here nigga so I could fuck her face  
Yeah I run this place, this is cashmere swag  
Niggas treadmillin' goin' nowhere fast  
Sittin' courtside at the Hawks game  
Louis on, I could trip a fuckin' ball player  
  
Fuck yeah, awesome yeah I lost some, of my mind  
And then I found peace it was really kind,  
Of awesome it's possible, goddamn right  
I've been honest the whole time  
  
Fuck yeah, awesome yeah I lost some, of my mind  
And then I found peace it was really kind,  
Of awesome it's possible, goddamn right

"[Chorus]  
Why everything that's supposed to bad make me feel so good?  
Everything they told me not to is exactly what I would  
Man I tried to stop man I tried the best I could  
But (You make me smile)  
  
What's your addiction? Is it money? Is it girls? Is it weed?  
I've been afflicted by not one, not two, but all three  
She's got the same thing, about me, but more, about us  
She's coming over, so I guess, that means, I'm on drugs  
Just let me peek now, I mean damn, I'm so curious  
She's got a lover, so the lies, and the lust, is a rush  
Time's of the essence, I need, you to be, spontaneous  
Roll up the doge, and he ain't see you-cut the quarter, then I'm co coming
over  
Cause its never over  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I see the emotion in your eyes, that you, try not to show  
We get the closest when you high, or you drunk, or you blow  
So I pour the potion, so we could both get high, as we could go  
Then I'll get the lotion, and do something to me, when your thighs is exposed  
There's no turning back now, I mean I don't mean to impose  
Not now but right now, I need you to undress, and then pose  
I'm into that now, catch a vibe, when the doors, get closed  
Roll up the doge, and he ain't see you-cut the quarter, and I keep co coming
over  
'Cause its ne-never over

I just wanted to ask you  
Just wanted to um  
Let how would I put this uhh  
Let's say all your friends  
Remember the one  
You said if you ever she would be the one  
OK, OK, OK (You make me smile with my heart)  
I was thinking, hypothetically  
I mean don't take this seriously  
Don't take me I mean just  
Uhh not credibly  
I'm feeling incredibly  
I mean let's see  
Just maybe  
I mean you are in me (You make me smile with my heart)  
Maybe, baby, baby  
You know I was just kidding

"[Verse 1]  
There must be more good women than men percentage wise  
So her chance of having a husband just minimize  
That's why a lot of girls claim they ain't into guys  
And mess with other girls part time to improvise  
I knew she wouldn't vibe  
No I seen her inner eyes  
But I'm like any other guy trying to get in her thighs  
She telling me about how black people should enterprise  
And I'm like, if you don't get your ass in this ride from enterprise  
That I rented yesterday and gotta have in by 5  
With the gas fully filled up like I didn't drive  
Told her I had a girl, nah fuck it I didn't lie  
Told her this rap game is alright. I'm just getting by.  
She had a lil weed and we get a lil high  
And I'm looking in her eyes and I'm loving her vibe  
Told me back in 95' she fell in love with the tribe  
Boo back in 92' I was just like you  
Please don't be confused by the ice and jewels  
I'm like any other nigga buy ice to stay cool  
Like any other nigga that claim they hate school  
And think yeah Free's banging but she's no Rachel  
  
[Chorus](x2)  
We ball til we fall  
Hit the mall  
After we  
Hit don't call  
We fill your lives  
With nothing but lies  
And I would like to  
Apologize  
  
But you can't stand right here  
And tell me everything is going to be alright  
Cause until the day a real man stands up  
I'm going to have to improvise  
  
[Verse 2]  
Was it something I did wrong?  
Yeah I know I'm wrong  
She's at home alone and I'm always gone  
Hate it when she mad but more when she passive  
Now she on the internet looking for classes  
Out of state though, man that hurt yo  
But I got work though, and I'm at work yo  
And she don't call a lot  
And when she do she pouring out her heart  
You never listen to me then the call drop hmmm  
And I promised her everything  
Told her when I get a deal I'll get her a wedding ring  
But when I got my deal I was back in the ring  
Fighting my urges, strip club splurges  
Never had money so I feel like a virgin  
And I'm trying to break the bank's cherry  
Trying to see can I afford Canaries, with a Ferrari, and a dinner date with
Halle Berry?  
When from 50 g's to fifteen hundred in a week  
Now I'm trying to call..one ring...two rings...seven rings...eight rings  
Her mother picked up the phone  
Like she in school and she don't stay here no more  
I guess there's more good women than men percentage wise  
So her chance of having a husband just minimize  
I guess that's why she says she ain't into guys  
And focus on school full-time to improvise  
  
[Chorus]  
  
No no, you can't stand right here  
And tell me everything is gonna be alright  
Cause until that real man stands up  
I'm going to have to improvise (x3)

You don't see just how fly my style is?  
I don't see why I need a stylist  
When I shop so much I can speak Italian  
I don't know I just wanted better for my kids  
And I ain't sayin' we was from the projects  
But every time I want it, layaway or a deposit  
My Dad'll say ""when you see clothes close ya eyelids""  
We was sorta like Will Smith and his son  
In the movie I ain't talkin' 'bout the rich ones  
'Cause every summer he'll get some  
Brand new hare-brained scheme to get rich from  
And I don't know what he did for dough  
But he'd sent me back to school wit' a new wardrobe and hey!  
  
(Did you realize, that you were a champion in their eyes?)  
I think he did, when he packed it up and brought it back to the crib  
Just a lil' somethin' show you how we live  
E'r'thing I wanted man it seemed so serious  
Mm hm, that's that shit  
So if you gon' do it, do it just like this  
(Did you realize, that you were a champion in their eyes?)  
  
When it feel like livin's harder than dyin'  
For me givin' up's way harder than tryin'  
Lauryn Hill say her heart was in Zion  
I wish her heart still was in rhymin'  
'Cause who the kids gon' listen to? Huh?  
I guess me if it isn't you  
Last week I paid a visit to the institute  
They got the drop out keepin' kids in the school  
I guess I'll clean up my act like Prince'll do  
If not for the pleasure, least for the principle  
They got the CD then got to see me drop gems  
Like I dropped out of P.E.  
They used to feel invisible  
Now they know they invincible

Since 86 showin the crowd what I?m about  
And they still want to know when the album comin? out  
Ask the teenagers, O?Gs and Ask the kids  
What they definition of Classic is  
Timeless, cause age don?t count in the booth  
And your flow stays submerged in the fountain of youth  
And no doubt the truth I?m off the meters  
Everybody co-signing even non-believers  
I came in the door, became one of y?alls leaders  
In the fresh pair of Air Force One sneakers  
Uptown we call ?em uppies when they on divas  
Prolly worn when KRS One teaches  
Nas, made you look, before the haters  
I bet you Kan had ?em on when he walked with Jesus

It?s performin?, look how long the line is  
That?s what happens when you make shit that?s timeless  
That?s what happens these rappers is the pioneers  
What do it take to be a legend like Nas is?  
That?s so novice, I?m so polished, I got a right to be a little bit snobbish  
I did a little bit of college, semesters it took 2 like Rob Base  
To let me figure out this wasn?t my place, the beat slowed til? you listened
to my pace  
'cause I be killin? shit, but that?s evident, and y?all feelin? it, but I
expected it

O you went platinum ? yeah that?s nice, now let me see you do the same thing
twice  
New times, 4 times, then been a couple of more times, please your amateur
night is show time  
It?s one life to live so live it the best you can, the world could use one
less man  
Not enough air, not enough car factories to manufacture new vehicles sedans
and vans  
When they do make the whip you like ya chips ain?t right, by the time you
could afford it the car ain?t important  
In the streets silent, it?s just I and - cops keep firin? in my environment  
Leavin? your slum when they drive home far from the hood brothers they eager
to jump on  
I like to be the wall that they post up on, I like to see them fall, guilty
for doing wrong  
I?m classic like the Air Ones, the Hustler shoe, that?s what I?m accustomed to

Instead of broadcasting how we smokin? trees, on the radio we need to hear

We invested in that it's like we got Merril-Lynch

Sometimes I feel the music is the only medicine  
So we cook it, cut it, measure it, bag it, sell it

See I done did all this ole bullshit  
And to atone I throw a little something, something on the pulpit  
We took that shit, measured it and then cooked that shit  
And what we gave back was crack music  
And now we ooze it through they nooks and crannies  
So our mammas ain't got to be they cooks and nannies

Head to the sky, wings raised in  
She's about to fly and take her place in  
Out there in the stars, when she leaves the ground  
She'll see a broken heart, if she turns around  
But aint no going back, this is how it must be  
He told her, she'll be burned alive  
She just told him trust me  
If funerals are beautiful, this ugly  
Knowing she told her you'll leave me if you loved me  
And he knows that, because he knows her  
Hard to hide his feeling's as it engulfs her  
Now she's a bright blaze, light rays  
A shooting out Phoenix on fire buring up the night scape  
So lets hear it for our heroine, applaud as our spirits fly into the never end  
One closed chapter, it opens up another part

We made it from the alley straight up to ballet  
We pulled up to the valet, we'll teach our daughter ballet  
We'll raise us a Beyonce, maybe she'll be a Halle

I would have been the best 'Ye

How cud my girl do this to me

Reportin live from the rubble  
Drinking all I can so I can turn to fire when I hug you  
One, two, three, four, five models on the double  
Give me head all at once look like they line in a huddle  
But it's not even half the feeling as hearing you shine  
She know I love ya, shedding tears everyday  
And I'm tired of lying in these puddles  
I ask ""Y"" sometimes like a f-cking vowel  
But hitting tree's everyday like a f-cking owl

My people, no goodbyes to you

Right now I can see it so vivid  
Like it was just yesterday like I could relive it  
Me and my grandparents on a field trid-ip  
And I'm the little kid tryna touch the exhibits  
But it'll fade before I get to get a hold of that  
Man I wish I could stop time like a photograph  
Every joke that they told I'd know to laugh  
Man, man I wouldn't let a moment pass  
What do it mean when you dream that you fallin'  
What do it mean when you dream that you ballin'  
What do it mean when you never dream at all then  
And you don't really know cause you can't recall them  
It's sorta fly you get a chance to say hi to  
People you never got a chance to say bye to  
Maybe you could pull em up outta your dreams  
Into real life, if you try to  
So close, but so far  
And so far, no cigar  
We can't dwell on the past all we got is today  
So I'm a live like there's no tomorrow  
No goodbye  
  
I don't wanna say goodbye to you  
So I'll just say good night to you  
My people, no goodbyes to you

Dream beautiful and unusual  
Wake up like everyday new to you  
Stay true to you, a hood musical  
My art will live through you  
Dream beautiful and unusual  
Wake up like everyday new to you  
Stay true to you, a hood musical

I ain't in love with the same stripper that sprung T  
Pain and all this Louis Vuitton shit ain't cheap, man  
  
Dawg, I can't keep sayin' G.O.O.D music the greatest latest  
Stuntin' out the middle of nowhere like Vegas  
From the Chi, the city of hella haters  
Where we keep risin' to the top like elevators  
  
Hi haters, I'm back of hiatus  
I feel just like you, I mean even I hate us  
Turn the radio down I mean every song  
Yeezy got a vision that's clearer than Evian  
Used to hit the radio them faggots ain't let me on  
  
Until Khaled turned up the volume  
Hit the club wit it come on homie they wildin'  
Nas done told you come on homie we major  
Really Doe told you hoes where we stayin'  
G.O.O.D music up in this bitch now quit playin'  
  
Dawg, it can't be G.O.O.D. music the Grammy Family  
A little bit a stuntin', flickin', dawg, it ain't deep  
I'm only tryin' to spend what they claim you can't keep  
Before you die so I make sure I stay on the Chi side  
Like Lake Shore Drive, The Grammy Family  
  
It's the Cons fool, word  
  
No, it can't be G.O.O.D. music my Grammy Family  
Used to bump the demo up outta the Camry  
Now we hoppin' out the limo or either the Lam B  
And after music meeting wit evenings with Angie  
  
It's gon' prolly add a joint that got John Legend and me  
And we be in Miami so when they spot me in Bentley  
It's gon' be a stampede 'cuz we be racin' Bentleys  
No different than Grand Prix's  
  
Fam please, don't make my man squeeze  
And we can take it to the cars and I'll show you the hand speed  
I started independent with owners from land speed  
But now they recognize the way they did for Sam Sneed  
  
And since I got my shot like I was call and man be  
I hope they lose they spot guarantee a plan B  
We'll be waitin' in the telly like Jamie and Fancy  
  
Prolly paintin' they nails in nuthin' but they panties  
And we'll be up town Jimmy and Camby  
Headed to the game to watch Kenyon and Camby  
  
They can't breathe or hardly catch they next breath  
And I know my nigga Ye told you we was the best dressed  
I know I got a buzz so plan up the next step  
  
So what ya'll wanna do when it comes to that next check  
And bet Quence and Khaled know what the business is  
So open up them envelopes you know who the winners is

No paper hoe, but you can have some more of me  
Or-gy, or are we, speakin' metaphorically  
Historically, I'm kickin' bitches out like Pam nigga  
Goin' HAM nigga, me and Jigga  
And a nigga still young, wanna have no kids  
But I've been practicing with some actresses as bad as shit  
Had a few white girls, asses flat a shit  
But the head so good, damn a nigga glad he hit  
Got 'em jumpin' out the building  
Watch out below, a million out the door

I hustle with vultures late nights  
Y'all mothafuckers woulda been food  
Fuck wrong with these dudes  
Try to walk around in these shoes  
See the shit I saw growing up  
And maybe you can take a peek at these boo's  
Niggas fantasize about the shit that I do daily like  
These rappers rap about all the shit that I do really  
I'm like really half a billi nigga  
Really you got baby money  
Keep it real with niggas  
Niggas ain't got my lady money  
Watch the Throne don't step on our road  
Bad enough we let you step on our globe  
When my nephew died, daddy dead  
Niggas took the price on my uncles head  
Nobody called the cops as my uncle bled  
So I feel like I would like to know my uncles bread  
Bow down, brother pay homage  
Don't spill hate all on my garments  
Commes Des Garcon, fuck your fresh  
Head shots nigga fuck your vests  
Fuck the pig, no pork on my fork  
Peace God 'cause you know a nigga just went Ham

Somewhere far along this road, he lost his soul to a woman so heartless..  
How could you be so heartless?  
Oh, how could you be so heartless?  
  
How could you be so, cold as the winter wind when it breeze, yo  
Just remember that you talkin' to me though  
You know need to watch the way you talkin' to me, yo  
I mean after all the things that we've been through  
I mean after all the things we got into  
Hey yo, I know of some things that you ain't told me  
Hey yo, I did some things but that's the old me  
And now you wanna get me back and you goin' show me  
So you walk around like you don't know me  
You got a new friend, well I got homies  
But in the end it's still so lonely

How could be so Dr. Evil, you bringin' out a side of me that I don't know  
I decided we weren't goin' speak so  
Why we up three A.M. on the phone  
Why does she be so mad at me for  
Homie I don't know, she's hot and cold  
I won't stop, I won't mess my groove up  
Cause I already know how this thing go  
You run and tell your friends that you're leaving me  
They say that they don't see what you see in me  
You wait a couple months then you gon' see  
You'll never find nobody better than me

You work late nights just to keep on the lights  
Mommy got me training wheels so I could keep on my bike  
And you would give anything in this world  
Michael Jackson leather and a glove, but didn't give me a curl  
And you never put no man over me  
And I love you for that mommy can't you see?  
Seven years old, caught you with tears in your eyes  
Cuz a nigga cheatin, telling you lies, then I started to cry  
As we knelt on the kitchen floor  
I said mommy I'mma love you till you don't hurt no more  
And when I'm older, you ain't gotta work no more  
And I'mma get you that mansion that we couldn't afford

Things I gotta do, just to prove to you

We all know Kanye is Mr. Louis Vuitton  
But if I see a L and a V I think that it's on  
That's what my old chick used to clash with me

Actually you should be happy I purchased that  
I take this as a sign you don't want the matching hat  
Huh I'm too gutter you more Parkay with yours  
I'm more I can't believe it's not butter  
What the other suckas do for love is a damn shame  
I got a new significant other cause plans change

You've never been no good for me  
I guess I was just way too hood for you to be with

The always rude Kanye, spaz in the news Kanye  
I miss the sweet Kanye, chop up the beats Kanye

You can still be who you wish you is  
It ain't happen yet  
And that's what the intuition is  
When you hop back in the car  
Drive back to the crib  
Run back to their arms  
The smokescreens  
The chokes and the screams  
You ever wonder what it all really mean  
  
And I wonder if you know  
What it means, what it means

What it means to find your dreams

Told me in my lifetime  
My name would help light up the Chicago skyline

Seven o'clock, that's primetime  
Heaven'll watch, God calling from the hotlines  
Why he keep giving me hot lines  
I'm a star, how could I not shine  
How many ladies in the house  
How many ladies in the house without a spouse  
Something in your blouse got me feeling so aroused  
What you about  
On that independent shit  
Trade it all for a husband and some kids  
You ever wonder what it all really mean  
You ever wonder if you'll find your dreams

Hello 'Mari, how ya doin'?  
I think the storm ran out of rain, the clouds are moving  
I know you're happy, cause I can see it  
So tell the voice inside ya' head to believe it  
I talked to God about you, he said he sent you an angel  
And look at all that he gave you  
You asked for one and you got two  
You know I never left you  
Cause every road that leads to heaven's right inside you  
So I can say

Hey, hey, hey, hey  
Oh the good outweighs the bad even on your worst day  
Remember how I'd say  
Hey hey one day you'll be the man you always knew you would be  
And if you knew how proud I was  
You'd never she'd a tear, have a fear, no you wouldn't do that  
And though I didn't pick the day to turn the page  
I know it's not the end every time I see her face, and I hear you say

Hello my only one, remember who you are  
You got the world cause you got love in your hands  
And you're still my chosen one  
So can you understand?  
One day you'll understand

No goodbyes, no goodbyes  
Just hello, just hello  
And when you cry, I will cry  
And when you smile, I will smile  
And next time when I look in your eyes  
We'll have wings and we'll fly

Hello my only one, just like the mornin' sun

Back when I was living at home and this was all a big dream  
  
And the fame will be got caught  
And the day I moved to LA  
Maybe that was all my fault  
All my fault to be a real boy  
Chasing the American dream,  
Chasing everything we seen

Hey now you'll get that 25 thou, job a year and  
You'll spend all your money on crack cocaine, but it'll be you're your money  
No more borrowing money from mom for my high  
So now you get you're degree tattooed on your back your so excited about it  
If you continue to work at the GAP, after several interviews, Oh my god!  
You'll come in at an entry level position and when you do that  
If you kiss enough ass, you'll move up to the next level  
Which is being a secretary's secretary!  
And boy is that great, you get to take messages for the secretary  
Who never went to college  
She's actually the bosses niece, so now your apart of the family  
You know what college does for you?  
It makes you really smart man  
All you kids want to talk in the back of the class not me, I listened, ok  
I was a hall monitor, This was meant to be,  
You know how many classes I took, extra classes extra classes  
No I've never had sex but you know what, my degree keeps me satisfied  
When a lady walks to me says ""hey you know what's sexy?""  
I say ""no, I don't know what it is,  
But I bet I can add up all the change in your purse really fast"".

When it comes to styles I got several  
Sharper than a swagger dagger all metal  
And my Ju-elz blue and yellow  
Type of shit that make em call you Carmelo  
Rules as follows stay true to the ghetto  
Write yo name on the bullet make you feel special  
Ha! What the fuck you boys talking about?  
I know it's us cuz we the only thing you talk about!  
And I'm gone.. Bye  
  
[T. I.]  
You go see weezy for the wordplay,  
Jeezy for the bird play,  
Kanyeezy for diversity and me for controversy,  
All my verses picture perfect  
And they meant to serve a purpose,  
You aint living what you kicking and you worthless,  
Looking from the surface it may seem that I got reason to be nervous,  
Then observe my work and see that my adversity was worth it,  
Verses autobiographical, absolutely classical, last thing I'm worried bout is
what another rapper do,  
Ain't nobody hot as me, even if they rap they ass off blast off and have
outstanding qualities,  
Sell alotta records I respect and salute that,  
But spitting real life on hot beats... I'm the truth at,  
You kick it like me no exaggeration necessary,  
Living revolutionary, nothing less than legendary,  
Gangsta shit hereditary, got it from my dad  
Flow colder than February with extraordinary swag!

"  
Adam lives in theory  
Trying to turn stone into bread  
Masquerading like he got it figured out  
Cut off from the sunshine, only smart in his own head  
Leaving his descendants to hope and doubt  
Left to his devices, those worth the sacrifices  
Praying to the alter of himself  
Making pilgrimages, thinking he's religious  
Like he's got all the light, and no one else  
He takes the unsuspected  
'cause he knows they're not connected  
And he shows them how to be just as he is  
Virtually real, and commercially appealed  
To the lust of all the people where he lives  
Eve was so naive, blinded by the pride and greed  
Wanting to be intellectual  
Drifting from the way she got turned down one day  
And now she thinks that she's bisexual  
Caught up in emotion  
Burning up in her devotion  
To the king of exploitaion in the field  
She handed him her virtue  
'cause he told her ""I won't hurt you""  
So she lay with him to see how good it feels  
Now can you tell me, what, what we gonna do now  
Where we gonna go now, what we gonna say now  
Now can you tell me, what, what we gonna do now  
Where we gonna go now, what we gonna say now  
Now after the sensation, and the empty fornication  
She brought affection home into her bed, quickly multiplying  
Now the 3 of them are dying by the poison she perceived to be good head  
Now Eve and her husband are perverted in their judgment  
'cause everything appears to be the same  
They entertain suggestion,  
Next time just use protection  
Desiring to cover up their shame  
But much to their demise, poor decision closed their eyes  
To the very antidote to their dilemma  
Burning in their lust,  
Both of them were dealt to us  
Destroying the original agenda  
Praying to the sky, in order to maintain a lie  
They exhausted every possible conclusion,  
They can't even entertain the solution,  
In a brain filled with vain information and pollution  
Hiding from the truth,  
He provided an excuse to explain away his desperate situation  
When confronted, blamed his wife  
Giving birth to carnal life  
Refusing to acknowledge what he done  
Now if we can agree with who created us to be  
Who says we're guilty everyone before his eyes  
Making no exceptions, since the day of our conception  
Predisposed to hating truth, and loving lies  
Then can you tell me, what, what we gonna do now  
Where we gonna go now, what we gonna say now  
Then can you tell me, what, what we gonna do now  
Where we gonna go now, what we gonna say now  
Stop walking in pride, let the thief be crucified  
Un-learn everything you know, and let him teach you  
Line upon line, every step upon pre-step, say goodbye,  
To this decaying social system  
He wants to know, how far we're willing to go  
If we love him like we say we do,  
He will try us  
Just don't regress,  
Or slip into hopelessness  
Once he's satisfied his love,  
He won't deny us,  
And then he'll tell us,  
What, what we gonna do now  
Where we gonna go now, what we gonna say now  
And then he'll tell us,  
What, what we gonna do now  
Where we gonna go now, what we gonna say now

It's been three weeks since you were looking for your friend  
The one you let hit it and never called you again  
Remember when he told you he was about the Benjamins?  
You act like you ain't here him, but gave him a little trim  
To begin, how you think you're really going to pretend  
Like you wasn't down and you called him again?  
Plus when, you give it up so easy you ain't even foolin' him  
If you did it then, then you'd probably do it again  
Talking out your neck, saying you're a Christian  
A Muslim, sleeping with the Gen(Gentile)  
Now that was the sin that did Jezebel in  
Who're you going to tell when the repercussions spin?  
Showing off your ass 'cause your thinking it's a trend  
Girlfriend, let me break it down for you again  
You know I only say it 'cause I'm truly genuine  
Don't be a hard rock, when you really are a gem  
Baby girl, respect is just the minimum  
Nigga's creepin' and you still defending him  
Now Lauryn is only human  
Don't think I haven't been through the same predicament  
Let it sit inside your head like a million women in Philly been

Let's stop pretend, the wanna pack pistol by they waist men  
Cristal by the case men, still living in his Mother's basement  
The pretty face men claiming that they be the big men  
Need to take care of their three and four kids  
But they face a court case when the child support's late  
Money taking and heart breaking now you wonder why women hate men  
The sneaky silent men, the punk domestic violence men  
Quick to shoot the semen, stop acting like boys and be men

Like I'm deuce, two people both equal  
Like I'm Gemini, rather Simeon  
If I Jimmy on this lock I could pop it  
You can't stop it, drop it  
Your whole crew's microscopic  
Like particles while I make international articles  
And on the cover  
Don't discuss the baby mother business  
I been in this third LP you can't tell me, I witness  
First handed I'm candid  
You can't stand it, respect demanded  
And get flown around the planet  
Rock Hard like granite or steel  
People feel Lauryn Hill from New-Ark to Israel  
And this is real, so I keep makin' the street's ballads  
While you lookin' for dressin' to go with your tossed salad  
  
You can get the money!  
You can get the power!  
But keep your eyes on the Final Hour!  
You can get the money!  
You can get the power!  
But keep your eyes on the Final Hour!  
  
I'm about to change the focus from the richest to the brokest  
I wrote this opus, to reverse the hypnosis  
Whoever's closest to the line's gonna win it  
You gonna fall trying to ball  
While my team win the pennant  
I'm about to begin it  
For a minute, then run for senate  
Make a slum lord be the tenant give his money to kids to spend it  
And then amend it, every law that ever prevented  
Our survival since our arrival  
Documented in The Bible, like Moses and Aaron  
Things gon' change, it's apparent  
And all the transparent gonna  
Be seen through, let God redeem you  
Keep your deen true  
You can get the green too  
Watch out what you cling to  
Observe how a queen do  
And I remain calm reading the 73 Psalm  
'Cause with all this going on I got the world in my palm  
  
You can get the money!  
You can get the power!  
But keep your eyes on the Final Hour!  
You can get the money!  
You can get the power!  
But keep your eyes on the Final Hour!  
  
Now I be breaking bread sipping  
Manichevitz wine  
Pay no mind party like it's 1999  
But when it comes down to ground beef like Palestine  
Say your rhymes, let's see if that get you out your bind  
Now I'm a get the mozzarella like a Rockerfeller  
Still be in the church of Lalibela, singing hymns a cappella  
Whether posed in Maribella in Couture  
Or collecting residuals from off The Score  
I'm making sure I'm with the 144  
I've been here before this ain't a battle, this is war  
Word to Boonie  
I makes a lot like a Sunni  
Get diplomatic immunity in every ghetto community  
Had opportunity went from Hoodshock to Hood-chic  
But it ain't what you cop, it's about what you keep  
And even if there are leaks, you can't capsize this ship  
Cause I baptize my lips every time I take a sip  
(Every time i take sips!)  
  
You can get the money!

Causing peoples to fail keeping a third in jail  
His words nailed everything to the tree  
Severing all of me from all that I use to be  
Formless and void, totally paranoid  
Enjoyed darkness's, Lord keeping me from the sword

The type of life that I've lived  
How many things I pray the father will forgive  
One situation involved a young man  
He was the ocean and I was the sand  
He stole my heart like a thief in the night  
Dulled my senses and blurred my sight

I used to love him but now I don't  
  
I chose the road of passion and pain  
Sacrificed too much and waited in vain  
Gave up my power ceased being queen  
Addicted to love yeah, like the drug of  
Drug of a fiend  
  
Torn and confused wasted and used  
Reached the crossroad which path would I choose  
Stuck and frustrated I waited, debated  
For something to happen that just wasn't fated  
Thought what I wanted was something I needed  
When mamma said no then I just should have heeded  
Misled I bled till the poison was gone  
And out of the darkness arrived the sweet dawn  
  
Repeat 1  
  
Father you saved me and showed me that life  
Was much more than being some foolish mans wife  
Showed me that love was respect and devotion  
Greater than planets and deeper than any oceans  
See, my soul was weary but now it's replenished  
Content because that part of my life is finished, oh yeah  
  
I see him sometimes and the look in his eye  
Is one of a man whose lost treasures untold  
But my heart is gold, see I took back my soul  
And totally let my creator control  
The life which was his to begin with

Afraid to address  
The reality before me  
Too proud to confess  
That I'm addicted to a lie  
So I seek temporary feeling  
To replace reality  
Though the truth is telling me I have to die  
But I've been taught to numb it  
Sedate it don't confront it  
I hate it when I found out  
That I can't get what I wanted  
This emotional tantrum  
Has become sort of an anthem playing everytime I need to take a little trip  
  
To hide this condemnation  
I'll find a combination  
Of a manmande stimulation  
To deny my situation  
Now this unreality  
Is distorting what I see  
Reporting back to me  
A sense of false security  
  
So in my imagination  
I must find a recreation  
Desperately in searching ways  
To alter my sensations  
There's no equilibrium  
Inebriated till I'm numb  
Intoxicated till I'm dumb

You're taught to camouflage regrets

Tell us god want us to suffer  
To suppot a situation  
We all know is obligation  
And if you shun the complication  
They'll just gun your repuation  
Like mob intimidation  
To enforce participation  
  
See they need to keep us fiends  
To their lies and broken schemes  
And if you find another means  
You're told you're being too extreme  
And if you wanted to get clean  
They'll just pull those social strings  
Holding up their social norms  
Deifying noble things  
  
Now were all stuck in tradition  
Unable to state our position  
Too afraid to contradict

He wasn't even concerned  
I tried, and I tried, and I tried  
To keep him in my life (to keep him in my life)  
I cried, and I cried, and I cried  
But I couldn't make it right  
  
But I, I loved the young man  
And if you ever been in love  
Then you'd understand  
  
That what you want might make you cry  
What you need might pass you by  
If you don't catch it (if you don't catch it)

Will turn out what you want to be  
If you just let it (if you just let it)

See, I thought this feeling  
It was all that I had  
But how could this be love  
And make me feel so bad? (gave up my power)  
Gave up my power  
I existed for you  
But who-ever knew  
The voo-doo you'd do  
  
But I, I loved the young man

Man-made terror  
Hungry jaws of death  
Y'all don't cross my depths  
I'll pause your breaths  
I cause you to sink down forty thousand leagues  
Bleeding to death with no arms in short sleeves  
My world's deep blue  
Killers gotta eat too  
Looking for human flesh to rip my teeth through  
Other fish in the sea but barracudas ain't equal  
To a half human predator created by a needle  
Jet black eyes baby they stare while you sleep  
When your titanic sink I'm the one you gon' meet  
Hearing terrified screams they surround my team  
All you see is trails of blood  
Even god won't intervene  
Nightmares of darkness  
My appetite is heartless  
Even if we related, you eliminated regardless  
In the deep blue, underwater wars  
Half man, half shark  
My jaws don't pause  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Our father who art in heaven  
Hallowed be thy name  
Killers sworn to beast  
Swallowed them in flames  
Switch my dna  
Flip me into cool j  
I can't fight the feelin'  
I'm born to kill prey  
To survive an attack  
There's only one way  
Battle to the death  
That's how sharks play  
Weapons left behind  
We dueling with the mind  
You blind, crippled, or crazy  
You're real easy to find  
Struggling to float  
With heomorhages in your throat  
Getting the lap dance  
While I smash through your boat  
Eat your whole fam'  
Nothing left but da right hand  
Clinging to a rail  
Escape attempts fail  
You'll never make it home  
Tear the flesh off your bone  
Walking in undercurrents is a dangerous zone  
I'm talking death out a moment's notice  
You wasn't focused  
Me and my crew strike  
Like some underwater locust  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Uh, uh take it deeper  
Uh, uh take it deeper  
Uh, uh take it deeper  
Uh, uh take it deeper  
  
These waters are waist level  
The hallway's flooded  
Lost your scuba gear  
The killer's cold-blooded  
His name's ll  
You don't really want it  
I ate your ancestors  
The ocean is haunted  
I'm closing in cause I'm supposed to win  
How the cold steel feel when it froze your chin  
Should of stayed on dry land  
Stroke while you can  
Cause now you under pressure in the land of the damned  
Abandoned pirate ships  
Eels and sod scum  
Fish that glow in the dark  
The titanic's hub  
Underwater storms  
You're blood is so warm  
You're life vest is off  
And that turns me on  
Killer for centuries  
The gotti of the deep  
In the next millennium  
I'm still gonna creep  
Sand under my belly, ocean over my head  
Through the light in the shadows

Even though sometimes I see you  
And I try to ignore you  
Deep inside I was thinkin' about you  
What do you think  
  
You are my life  
I have to go on  
Havin' me any way you want me baby  
Just love me til the tension's gone  
And don't you come too soon  
  
I'm patient I never come too soon  
When I kissed you you said it was the same old tune  
But I missed you my life was filled with gloom  
I was hopeless sittin' in an empty room  
When you re-appeared I was back in the mix  
I put the key up in the lock cause true love fixed  
All the drama got to stop baby no more tricks  
My broken heart was addicted but now it's fixed  
And I cherish you forever believe me you  
You's a priceless treasure from my point of view  
It took time to change I'll admit that  
My back in the days love I had to get back

You are my star ship  
Come take me up tonight  
And don't be late  
You are my star ship  
Come take me up tonight  
And don't be late  
And don't you come too soon  
(never that)  
  
I never thought that I would ever lay beside you again  
Tastin' every inch plus being your friend  
Romantic nights with shootin' stars and full moons  
Kiss the rose better til it come full bloom  
Can you feel it passions overflows in waves  
Keep it steady providin' everything you crave  
Now you ready I like that my love you save  
I love it when a bad girl agrees to behave  
It's the motion that makes your love affair complete  
But devotion makes it all twice as sweet  
Back together reunited bonded once more  
Before I was hesitant but now I'm sure

Her boyfriend's down with the M-O-be  
Driving around in a 300e  
Trunk jewelry and all that  
Talking bout, ""My man can't fall black!""  
Sipping on cham', diamonds on her hand  
Taking cash, carrying drugs for her man  
Driving around in a kitted up Jetta  
Under the seat a automatic Beretta  
You know, the whole blase blah of rap  
Telling brothers they need to get off the bra-strap  
That's the type of girl she is  
Word to Miz, she got the  
Full length blue fox, knock you out the box  
Big rocks, this girl is hype Hobbes  
The type of girl that cold did son wrong

Her man be smacking her up  
Yeah, backing her up  
To the wall, get undressed, where you going?  
You ain't playing me out with that hoeing  
Look in the mirror, check the jewels  
Silly rabbit, you know the rules  
But he had to leave on another deal  
So she's out there with sex appeal  
It's the weekend, time for freaking, she's sneaking  
Outside, telling her home girls, we can  
Do the do, with who-ever we want to  
Cause we're the fly girl crew  
Not knowing her man messed up the money  
Riding around, thinking everything's funny  
Went in a disco, came outside  
Somebody pushed her in a beat up ride  
She had to pay for her man's mistakes  
They shot her in the head  
That's the breaks

For as long as I can remember  
You're all a real man could need  
And could ever ask for  
This is more than a crush

It was Harlem at the ruckus  
I saw you with your man, a smiling, huh  
A coach bag in your hand  
I was laying in the coupe with my hat turned back  
We caught eyes for a moment and that was that  
  
So I skated off as you strolled off  
Looking at your legs, god damn, they look so soft (so fine)  
I gotta take ya from your man, that's my mission  
If his love is real he's got to handle competition  
You only knew him five months, (that's right)  
Besides he drinks too much, and smokes too many blunts  
  
And I'll be working out everyday thinkin' about you  
Looking at my own eyes in the rear view  
Catching flashbacks of our eye contact  
Wish I could lay you on your stomach and caress your back  
I would hold you in my arms and ease your fears  
I can't believe it, I ain't had a crush in years

Hey lover, hey lover  
This is more than a crush  
Hey lover, hey lover  
This is more than a crush, lover  
Hey lover, this is more than a crush  
Hey lover, hey lover  
This is more than a crush  
  
I see you at the bus stop waiting every day  
Your man must think it's safe for you to travel that way  
And I don't want to violate your relationship  
So I'll lay back in the cut with a crush that's a trip  
  
Still he can't stop me from having daydreams  
Tongue'n you down with uh, vanilla ice cream  
Kissing on your thighs in the moonlight  
Searching you body with my tongue girl all night  
  
I wonder one day could it be, (how I wonder)  
Simple dreams could turn into reality  
Our love would come down so naturally  
We would walk down the aisle of destiny  
  
Would your man get his hustle on, got your type scared  
Break your off a little chump change to do your hair  
It seems to be enough to satisfy your needs  
But there's a deeper level if you follow our lead, hey lover  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Last week I saw ya at the mall  
Standing at the pay phone about to make a call  
I had a vision it was me on the other end  
Telling you come by and then you walked in  
  
I touched you gently with my hands  
We talked about traveling the distant lands  
Escaping all the madness out here in the world  
Becoming my wife no longer my girl  
  
Then you let your dress fall down to the floor (oh yeah)  
I kissed you softly and you yearned for more  
We experienced pleasure unparalleled  
Into an ocean of love we both fell  
  
Swimming in the timeless currents of pure bliss  
Fantasies interchanging with each kiss  
Undying passion unites our souls  
Together we swim until the point of no control  
  
But, it's a fantasy, you won't come true  
We never even spoke and your man swears he love you  
So, I'm gonna keep all these feelings aside, (that's right)  
Keep my dreams alive until the right time

Ain't nothing like a fantasy kid  
Words up  
Hey lover, hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush  
Hey lover, hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush  
Hey lover, hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush  
Hey lover, hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush

My shit is  
The slo mo, crept up nice and slow  
Breathin' on my ice, so it shine real nice  
Crease my scar peice  
Laid back in my seat  
Right near Bazely projects, on the back streets  
Her name was Keisha, full of street knowledge  
Pumped a little trees, but she planned to go to college  
Staring at my ice, smellin' my cologne  
She lived on the southside, so bring things on  
Honey got flavour, and it just don't stop

We jetted to city island to eat shrimp and talk  
Sourced up my keys to the valet cat  
I glanced at the fatty, I'm a see about that  
We blazed in the spizza like Bonnie and Clyde  
Scooby dooby hizza  
I'm feeling the vibe, cop the blue for some video type shit  
Knowing all along how hot these kind of nights get, uh  
I've got her right where I want her  
Reality about to creep up on her  
Stroke her softly, gently with my G  
While the light reflects off my icp  
Waiter, ice the crystal, let it simmer  
Lights to bright, here's a grand make them dimmer  
I kept fronting and I just couldn't stop  
I don't mind spending paper when it's looking that hot

Shorty you degrade yourself  
Just to throw a little bit of ice on the shelf  
You turnin' me off, I can't lie  
Keisha said ""why?""  
I said, ""yo, how can a man respect that, knowin' if he paid,

Ice is the price for an overnight wife  
A true shark caller don't want that in his life  
So all you ladies that are selling you're souls  
You need to put you hooker vibes on hold  
Ask for Keisha, she working on the stroll,  
Dead ass broke, but her pimp the man grow

I'm wearing triple black, a Gear's top flight  
Trips to Venice the man a steel when a menace  
A match made in heaven when we blend this  
Lovers everlasting in other words endless  
To love any other man would be senseless in yor face  
On the real was the honey looking laced?

Lolli-lolli-pop-pop, boppin' down the block-block  
I've been lovin' you since junior high, ma you got  
Everything I need, everything I want  
You're the type of dime a real player want to flaunt  
Lovin' them lips and the shape of them hips  
When I see you in that whack brother's whip, I FLIP  
I hate your boyfriend, that cat is corny  
I kick it to you and I dare that clown to run up on me  
When nights are stormy I be thinkin' about your pretty smile, gritty style  
But duke got you locked down like Riker's Isle  
I want to break your man off, I can't control it, I'm a hater  
Especially, when your perfume lingers inside the elevator  
You're the one, the only one  
That I would beg, to give me some  
Playerism's for life, eternal flossin', proceed with caution  
Baby toss him, divorce him, let the boss in

So ballistic, mystic, twisted  
In my dreams I kissed it, never missed it, I frisked it  
Searched it, worked it, lollipopped it and jerked it  
You followed, swallowed, scratch my back, baby burped it  
Red Passion, high fashion  
Nobody got to know I'm smashin', I'm sayin' shorty  
Rock, Miss Thang, playin' childish games  
Standin' on the corner knowin' damn well I want to blaze  
Sweet get to it anywhere you like  
On the rooftop, at midnight  
The project stairs, I'll be there  
Runnin' my fingers through your hair  
Anyway, the untouchable, magnetic  
Kissable lovable huggable energetic, call a medic  
Your man'll regret it, when I hit it I'm athletic  
Energize your thighs you'll recognize the size  
It's epidemic

When why'all alone in the Brooklyn brownstone  
Starin' at the high ceiling, what a feeling  
Clothes peeling, finally you're double dealing  
I'm walkin', he's wheeling, it's unreal when  
You got the dime of your fantasies  
My lollipop ecstasy's on top of me  
Just like I thought, it's a small world after all  
I don't care if your neighbors hear us down the hall  
Make 'em jealous, what they gon' tell us?  
If you don't tell your girls baby, I won't tell the fellas  
If you don't plea, I orchestrated icebergisms  
Visions of my lollipop's thick risen, for my wisdom  
Plop plop fizzdom, what I give them

I love you baby, take it deep deep deep  
Deep deep deep, now go to sleep

"Back in the days I made up my mind  
That I would be a king, you know, genuine  
Reign supreme at the top of the heap  
And like working all day, no time to sleep  
Destined to rise, in front of your eyes  
So we surmise, it's time for the prize  
The time has come, we gotta be number one  
The world is full of power and we got to get some  
No more beggin' and useless teardrops  
So I'm trading these teardrops for props  
Goin' all the way and with my powerful team  
Conquering the world and I'ma rise like cream  
All out, putting heads to bed  
'Cause I'm a grown man and I hate to get spoon-fed  
Wisdom, son, I rose in the east  
Till we reach the top, won't be no peace, 'cause it's

Strictly business, strictly business  
Ain't no way I'm gonna stop  
Strictly business, ain't no time to get more

Everything we do, gotta be brand new  
The moves we make, gotta make the earth shake  
Sitting at my desk, 'cause I manifest to my team  
Big plans that'll make us the best  
'Cause we can rule this game we all play  
Pop champagne and make everyday a holiday  
Smooth as a rose but hard like steel  
From now on, I'ma make my dreams real  
On a mission, gotta get there  
If you want to rule, you gotta be in there  
Our masterplan is the best  
And ain't a man alive that'll beat us to a conquest  
'Cause this is the reason we was born  
To rock on and on and on and on  
Look at my eyes, it's hypnotizing  
Word is bond, we gotta keep on rising

I'ma be a legend in all the books and mags  
Stuffin' the cash inside garbage bags  
Ain't no time to waste, we gotta motivate  
Pass anybody that stops to get gas  
Forever and a day, my destiny's set  
No sweat, I make it rougher than rougher gets  
Hold on tight, if not, get blown away  
Pick up the pieces 'cause we're known to say  
Radical things to get a champion's ring  
Give it up, punk, don't make me swing  
We planned ahead to get the butter and the bread  
Dressed in black and I'm stayin' out the red  
So when it comes to like taking charge  
Get props for where they do and stop frontin' on tar  
Gotta go for what you know to be the cream of the crop  
With the power of God, I'ma rise to the top, it's

Every red light she'll come over to your ride  
Or she's standin' in the doorway tellin' you to come inside  
The Bristol Hotel, 'cause it ain't no thing  
And her meat tastes better than Burger King

Glasses all foggy when they come in the place

The girlies made attempts but Harold played it cool

Hyping 'em up and slowing 'em down

Shaking 'em up and then baking 'em up  
Smash boom bash scraping 'em up

Cause I'm a roll on the microphone  
And take control just like Al Capone  
I'm notorious, you're foolish if you sleep on me  
Cause I'm too slick to let a rapper get sweet on me  
Try to make a move for my heavyweight belt  
You get played like the Wizard of Oz witch, you melt

Knowin' how I live, bed extra big  
You sit around, run your mouth, potbelly on the couch  
Claimin' you hot but honey what you wove out  
When she alone, pump L, I make her bounce  
You on the corner riskin' your life to sell a ounce  
Wish you was Pablo, lay in the carbo  
With a chick named Margo who flew from Chicago  
But no, in real life cats catch it  
It's not what you expected huh? Life kinda hectic huh?

"Here we go, another funky style  
Peace to my brothers on ""Rikers' Isle""  
Introducin' the crew, that's goin' a mile  
To get behind the ropes, stop actin' wild  
This here part is like section one  
So you can bug-a-loo and set fire to your buns  
Early mornin' light is yet to come  
And when it come, we'll get buggy in the sun  
Females, let your hair down  
Cause this is how we do it when we go uptown  
With the funky sound, the razzamatazz  
You give me to the ""sploshers"", you can get your-a blast  
Enter at your own risk, some brothers got weapons  
Yet you're still steppin', the beats' so funkafied  
And answer to the bone, people'll be dancin' alone  
Leanin' on the wall next to grandma's mop  
With the funky, funky groove that's far from pop  
Dosey-do your partner all night long  
And all you mothers, bring your kids along

(Yo Uncle) yeah, hah, I do a little somethin'  
(Yo Uncle) whats up, whats up?  
(Yo Uncle) (just kick a little somethin')  
  
Ain't no mountain high enough to overcome this  
Funky-like type of stuff  
The feds are ridiculous, they call my bluff  
Oh, my wrists are too skinny to hold me with cuffs  
I got the sure-shot guaranteed mover  
Suck it like a hoover and do ya whole maneuver  
Don't stop till you get it on  
With ya head B-boppin' like a bouncy ball  
They do it in the park, they do it in the mall  
But when I do it (yeah), I'm doin' it for y'all  
Asiatic, automatic, your funky fanatic without no static  
Flippin' on the freak like I'm acrobatic  
You were searchin' for the funk and I had it  
Here we go, hand over the cash yo  
What chime? Hey yo, blast the Tabasco  
Work your body like a dime, oh no  
Do the freaky-deaky, the whole girls' cargo  
Females on the side, we gotta win 'em, yeah  
The back pockets are stuck with nothin' in 'em, yeah  
Except my beeper number, rubbin' all my lumber so I cannot slumber  
Makes me sick like an earthquake  
So do the baddy-too-true, we got cash to make  
Able body, ready to party, all the ladies in the house  
Must be eatin' hardy  
And provin' and movin', groovin', so soothin' good for ya  
And clinically proven, damn!  
Every little bit of the tip makes ya taste flip, like sugar on Ritz  
Get on down, to the sure-shot sound  
Cause all five burrows are rockin' uptown

Pump up the nasty, nasty, nasty sound  
Kick back and let it please ya like a rub down  
Put ya body in the lost and found  
(Kick that L) I love the way its goin' down  
What you see is what you get  
And all the words who's next to be the teachers pet?  
Down-home monkey, corn fed, original  
And what you do is up to you, the individual  
This is the place to be for why'all underage brothers  
With the rebel mentality  
Sweet young freaks sayin' ""Rock me ?Arma-day-us?  
Skin so smooth lookin' all ?  
Video to video, tape to tape  
Walkin' through the jam in search of a playmate  
Party is packed like a rich mans' fridge  
Too many people in the crib  
The situation is sweaty and crazy like Eddy  
And yes we are ready to funk it up steady  
Ain't nothin' here petty  
Trip down to your laund-a-ray, I'm ready!  
Hold your horse, and baby feel the force  
And get jaws off, no matter what the cost  
Come out to cloth, get hot like a stove  
Early in the mornin', we're dancin' in robes  
To a funkafied sweaty, greazy groove  
I know the Marley remix to make you move

Nails in her mouth, stay tryin' to tempt me  
She rolls with her sister and they both real friendly  
It wasn't like that when my pockets was empty  
  
Shorty named Suzie, not quite a floozy  
Let's just say she has a problem bein' choosy  
Scarf on her doobie when she in the jacuzzi  
On the celly with her man, ""Love you, I'm at the movies""  
  
Bird named Chyna (baby where you find her)  
Uptown, she wrote a map down with eyeliner  
Hotness, two or three girlfriends behind her

So after school, I take a dip in the pool  
Which is really, on the wall

Than a sucker, could ever spend  
But I couldn't give a what about them cats you with  
Get your friends baby, jump in the Benz

Whylin' out with the gavel and the silk pajamas (let's go)

Girl named Kelly, rhinestones in her belly  
Curly red hair, crackin jokes in the telly  
Game concealed, a female Machiavelli  
Hopin and prayin that I ain't ready for the jelly

Maybe the waffle house, down South there's many  
She fix me a T-bone and take it to the Bentley  
  
Little Shaniqua, from Massapequa  
Went and bought a beeper so I could reach her, anyway

"I'm the Ladies Love, legend in leather  
Long and lean, and I don't wear pleather  
Last of the red hot loving MC's  
Looking for a little, that's my theory  
It goes quick like lightning, too exciting  
Lover of ladies, don't allow biting  
Level-headed leader, toy boy feeder  
Good love life and a rhyme biter beater  
Looking, learning, the one you're liking  
Listen and you will love what I'm writing  
Ladies love, long, hard and lean  
And now you know what L.L. means

Let's get ill!  
Come on now  
Let's get ill!  
Everybody  
Let's get ill!  
Everybody  
Let's get ill!  
  
Lightning in the sky, L.L. don't lie  
I can hold a larger load than those other little guys  
My literature is the land's highest law  
The man of the brand, one you look out for  
I'm loose like the lace in your brand new sneaker  
Release the bass in your face like a large Vega speaker  
Listen to my rhyme  
Here to satisfy the listeners who stood on line  
Bought tickets to see me kick it and wasn't late  
The love every little bit of the cuts he creates  
First not last, leader of the class, see  
From London, Long Beach, and down to Tallahassee  
Ladies are pleased, I'm not wearing Lee's  
The Kangol is mine, the godfather is E  
I bust your lip, my level won't slip  
Clocking crazy dollars on the L.L. tip  
Come on!

Loose with the ladies, loud like a ref  
When I die, there will be no lovers left  
I'm the little girl liker, legendary writer  
Let's see, I never lost cause I burn like a lighter  
My love is long and my lyrics rock loud  
Lurking shadow in the shadows like Little McLoud  
I'm the Ladies Love, lyrical lord in the club  
Ladies Love, the man you dream of  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Never ever lost, not lonely or alone  
You can call me the last Capone  
Not a little kid playing with garbage can lids  
Don't need a legal lawyer, I ain't doing no bid  
Cause the ladies know my bass is low  
Rocking L after L ever since the intro  
Liberace couldn't rock it like the long-legged pro  
Two legs, not four like Lassie, I don't eat Alpo  
Come on  
  
[Chorus]  
  
All over the land they listen to my jams  
Like a cherry lollipop when you're licking your hand  
I'm popping and locking, so I can give you a list  
All of my lyrics are swift, so the losers never riff  
I love giving em bliss, having my name on the list  
I'm the life of the party and my rhymes are priceless  
Each jam is like a lesson other rappers must learn  
Cold laugh cause they don't like it every time I return

They want a man to work with his hands  
Too young to die, and they don't give a damn

Mouth to feed, somebody's gettin' robbed

Check out the bombs!!!

In the mornin', a brother feels like a jerk  
Seein' black women and white men go to work  
So all women fear, the brothers ain't real  
Cause they won't give us no jobs, that's the real deal  
Hold my hand while I get it all together  
They don't deserve me at times of bad weather

You get leary when they got tinted windows

Live our lives and explore  
There is no topping you, you're untoppable  
  
So what you sayin'? Uh-huh  
Hehehe, I appreciate it  
  
It's so amazing, your love, to me  
It's so amazing, amazing, to me  
It's so amazing, your love, to me  
It's so amazing, amazing, to me  
  
It's alright  
Sometimes you work late at night (I know baby)  
(I miss you too)  
Just as long, as you don't defy my love  
Then it's on (I promise you baby)  
(I'll always love you)  
  
Uh, uh, slide out to Venice, my game's in order  
Would chip in to vent, but the city's on water  
Searchlights and fireworks bling the sky  
A vowel on the end of everything we buy  
Yellow ice in both ears, I loosen up the tie  
I'm lovin' this life style, baby I can't lie  
It feels so good it make a grown man cry  
Cause I made it out the hood and a lot of my crew died  
I guess I had determination  
And baby girl kept me in the congregation  
Now it's private jets and deep conversation  
Hundred G's a month to show appreciation  
All eyes on us, the cameras flash  
In God We Trust, I don't love this cash  
But you was definitely, by my side when my world collapsed  
Now I'm, rich for life and I'm payin you back  
  
This is like this for life baby  
This gon' always be like this  
God is my witness  
Hold you tight for the rest of my life  
Yknahmsayin?  
There's nothing I won't do for you baby  
I'm your man, I'm your man  
Our love is amazing, yeah  
  
It's so, amazing, to me

Lights, camera, action, hold up  
You know my style, I been blowed up  
Paper was young, now it's growed up  
Stacks so thick it's hard to fold up  
Yo b, find another rubber band in the truck  
Count up the money, I'ma stand in the cut  
Stroll in the party and I toast Cris' up  
Tell that a muh-hucca gets this up  
Shake that cookie like what like what  
Toss me a drop it's like lightning struck  
Look at that apple cobbler butt  
Whatchu want to do, whatchu think? Want cut  
NBA Live in my truck  
Parkin' lot like all jammed up  
If there's beef it's best you duck  
I'm gon' eat 'til I'm filled up

Throw it to me, that apple cobbler  
Baby it, can I see (can I see) that apple pie?  
I said throw it to me, that apple cobbler  
Baby it, can I get (hey) can I get it deep fried?  
  
So much sugar it's makin' my head rush  
Tell me what the recipe is for that stuff  
Break me off a piece of crust  
I'm so full I'm bout to bust  
Just one slice is not enough  
Dang that thang tight like handcuffs  
What I gotta say to you for you to give it up?  
What if I was payin' you so you could live it up?  
Hoochie seats inside yo' truck  
Tiffany rocks and trillion cuts  
You be Starsky, I be Hutch  
Ride shotgun, I pop that clutch  
Juicy sweatpants drive me nuts  
Take my 2-way, stay in touch  
I'm gon' scoop you, heat you up  
Take you, bake you, eat you up

Turn that hair 'round, buck them hips  
Love when your hair get stuck to your lips  
Apple cobbler sweet and thick  
I'm gon' eat you 'til I'm sick  
Yo' dessert is worth a grip  
I admit you make me trip  
Make me want to run to the mall like I'm a trick  
I can't believe you're makin' a baller have a fit  
Trippin', switchin' past my clique  
Lick that juicy, ask my clique  
Stretch them jeans girl make them fit  
Make me go outside and pit  
You know me, my cake is sick  
Me and Timbo makin' hits

Just how hot can one girl get?

"Ah yeah  
I want to send this one out to all the jeep lovers worldwide  
City to city, ghetto to ghetto  
Some flavor for you and yours  
And your jeep  
  
You're the type of girl that got class and style  
Still in all you need the backseat of my jeep once in a while  
So I pull up to your door to give you what you're looking for  
Hardcore  
I know you want to come, in my jeep  
We can park on a back street  
You're checkin' out my car phone, scopin' out my jewelry  
Let's do this in a hurry  
Air freshener is kickin', drive through for chicken  
I know you need a good stickin'  
That's when I see my man Snoop  
Peace, what up kid? loungin' duke  
As I turn the corner, starin' in your cornier  
You're gettin' hornier and hornier  
I'm pumpin' up a blint tape (flavor)  
You're legs is incredible, I do a double take  
You're puttin' on your lipstick  
I want to give you this big fat (yea)  
Quick, I know a place where we can lounge and cool, don't sleep  
(where at?) back seat of my jeep

Back seat of my jeep, let's swing an episode  
Back seat of my jeep, let's swing an episode  
Back seat of my jeep, let's swing an episode  
Back seat of my jeep, let's swing an ep'  
  
I'm pullin' over near your building  
I light a candle on the dashboard, we're chillin'  
I knew a girl like you would love a scene like this  
You got class but deep down you're real freakish  
You got it all, but you never had a wild episode  
That's when me and my jeep showed  
Up with the funk in the trunk and  
Hittin' it, we're spunkin'  
I'll even get you drunk and tipsy  
Cause I know you're feelin' frisky  
You love it 'cause it's wild and risky  
You got your eyes on the hood  
You're up to no good  
I took you in the back, you hoped I would  
You got your black on black so stacked in the back  
While I'm pumpin' in the CD I'll skip a track  
Windows are foggy  
And, uh, back seat treats in the streets could be a hobby  
And you ain't in between the Isley Brothers' sheets  
I give it to you real raw in the backseat  
That's how you want it, don't ya? (yeah)  
You'll tell your girlfriends, won't ya? (nah)  
Don't lie  
Take it in your eye (why?)  
So buckle up, buckle up  
What's my name? what's my name? what's my name? what's my name? huh  
I never knew a four wheel drive could be so live  
I'll put your numbers in the archives  
So take 'em off, and put them things on the mirror girl  
It's my jeep and your world  
You got it going on lovely, time to do the right thing  
'cause I can tell you want to swing  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We're bonin' on the dark blocks  
Wearin' out the shocks, wettin' up the dashboard clock  
Seats full of sweat, I told ya I would hit it  
Your kitty, kitty, cat, cat, was hungry so I fed it  
Workin' as a team  
Somebody, anybody (scream)  
Jump with me to the cash bar  
I'll be like Bruce Lee in them skins goin' ""wah""  
Damn, it's so good, the mad grip on my tip  
You're still a nice girl but my jeep makes ya flip  
You go wild and stick your toes on the roof (yeah yeah)  
You're so cute, wit' your gold tooth  
Extensions on the carpet  
That nice round brown is my target  
It's so firm, so cushy, it makes me feel mushy  
I love it when it's pushy  
But don't laugh, I'm serious with this (word up)  
The back seat of my jeep, is priceless  
You're climaxin', you're climaxin', it's full action  
You love a good waxin', it's so relaxin'  
  
Give me a hug  
See what I'm sayin' love?

Never go against me, you lack resources  
What? I skywalk with the forces  
Back in the 80's I was playin' in Porsches  
Money ain't a problem, I toll my losses  
Maserati coup, take galloping horses  
Nah, there's never been one like me  
They're looking for a new me as if there might be

But now I teach class, put back Tony  
You see it in my eyes, transparent like glass  
Giving all for my soul to have another smash  
Yea, LL Cool J  
30 years later, be me for a day  
Same day, just a daddy, she love me anyway  
So I told er what to read and I showed er how to pray  
Cats on my team, got NBA  
But it's my black, from the web we stay  
I don't whack my suicides, I act my age  
Never try to sound like a rapper I raised  
Roared as a tiger, can't grow no brains  
But the money's coming in in 360 ways

You can see the effects of gettin' treated incorrect

Her girlfriends tried to warn her, all he wanted was the sex  
Once he get it, then he gone, then it's on to somethin' fresh  
  
somethin' new, nothin' borrowed, nothin' blue, no weddin' dress  
But that's aight, you still young, you got your lifetime left

We feel deep in love growing up in Queens  
We didn't know a thing about love  
We was innocent sneakin' on the doorstep to hug  
Held you tightly and promised you the world  
You gave me hickeys and said you was my girl  
When I think about it now makes me smile  
Cause I ain't felt these butterflies in a while  
  
Funny how you grow up and innocence fades  
We used to live for love but now we're afraid (Of what?)  
Of the darkness and bitter memories  
Lovers who crushed us through infidelity  
I promised you I'd love you to the end  
Always and forever since way back when  
You're like candy the world's sweetest friend  
You taste better now than you did back then

You will always be my candy  
One day we will start a family  
You will always be my candy girl

Want your love girl, understand me  
You will always be my candy girl  
  
While you sucked caramel apple lollipops  
Rain sleet or snow I'm troopin' up the murdock  
We used to walk down the block hold hands  
I would get you after school 'cause I was your man  
And any guys that want to socialize  
Just know that I'm a flip on any cat that tries  
My peeps used to say I was whipped  
All your girls said since you got with him you flipped  
But uh they couldn't feel the feelings we felt  
Mirrors on the ceiling we melt  
I would look up at ya I remember  
The afternoon you surrendered  
We made love the temperature was high as could be  
You said ""Todd promise you ain't lyin' to me""  
And as we went our separate ways you turned back  
Smiled, I remember all that

And in the back of my mind I hear my memories call  
Of days when love was true I slept and held you  
Taste the brown sugar, let your climax melt you  
Candy you're occupying all of my thoughts  
Turned my soul upside down with lessons you taught  
I can feel you even when you're far away you're right here wit' me  
Sweet love strictly  
And I'm a bend over backwards to keep you on my side  
Take you for a mental and emotional ride  
Make love to your soul, your heart, and your mind  
In your hour of need girl, I'll be there every time  
And as long as you support my dreams  
Stayin' right beside me as a part of my team  
I'll take you where the average man can only dream of  
Cause in a world so sour I got the sweetest love

I'm fully prepared, I'm already steel  
You go to the bathroom for a second  
I understand baby, I know what you checkin' (a-heh-heh)  
That's when you come back and walk to me slow  
That's when you change up and let it all flow  
I'm kissin' on your belly ring nice and slow  
I love to take my time, love to give you a show  
Get the warm chocolate syrup to travel below  
Use my ears like handlebars, take control  
Ain't no sense in stayin' calm and playin' the role  
Baby relax, let me touch your soul  
I can't explain it  
  
[Chorus]  
  
My turn to get rocked, lifted out my socks  
with sound effects and whatnot (mmm)  
A little perfume above the right spot, just a touch  
Never too much, I lick it like a Dutch  
Two of my favorite numbers, you know what I mean  
Add 'em up and they equal fifteen  
You the 6 I needed you like a fix  
I can see it my mind, I knew we was gon' click  
I pick up the pace  
You feel the stubble from my beard on your face  
I look at your lips and take a taste  
Switch it up I got my hands on your waist  
We whylin' out, we all over the place  
I'm holdin' on with a strong embrace  
You holdin' on and tryin' to keep the faith  
Together we blast to outer space, I can't explain it

What you wanna do homeboys and all you fly girls?

1, 2, 3 muevete!  
  
The club was far from empty  
It was crowded at the entry  
I slide right through like how I do  
This girl began to tempt me.  
She said her name Shaiyeeda  
I could tell her mama feed her  
When they tight and when them jeans don't fit  
I'm L, nice to meet ya.  
I could feel my body yearnin'  
The room just started turnin'  
Didn't wanna go out on the floor  
But this girl was so determined (Let's dance)  
My brain began to sizzle  
I'm sweatin' just a little  
On the dance floor in the middle,  
She turned around and giggled,  
She said  
  
You got, you got, you got  
What it takes to make me leave my man  
  
It's hard to control myself  
It's hard to control myself  
You got, you got, you got  
What it takes to make this boy be bad  
It's hard to control myself

It's hard for me to control myself  
Get to hold myself  
Back from  
Jumpin' on ya  
Like I wanna,  
Like I wanna, wanna.  
  
Temptation is a mother,  
How we lust for one another  
We barely know eachother  
Yet we're whilin' like we're lovers (uh huh)  
The air is filled with passion  
The strobe lights are flashin'  
The hustlers throw cash n  
The bar tender keeps splashin'  
Her moves were so erotic  
Her games were so hypnotic  
I bet this girl could stop it  
But she continued to pop it  
  
You know I know you like it,  
Let me hit you on your sidekick  
Cause the after party is at my body,  
Meet me, you're invited  
  
You got, you got, you got  
What it takes to make me leave my man  
  
It's hard to control myself  
It's hard to control myself  
You got, you got, you got

Jumpin' on ya  
Like I wanna,  
Like I wanna, wanna.  
  
She licked off  
Her lip gloss  
Her hips toss  
Back and forth  
Side to side and  
Up and down  
She touched the ground  
It turned me out.  
I'm battlin' desire,  
Lord help me douse this fire  
This internal inferno,  
Hotter than a shot of cuervo  
Her top was short and purple  
Belly dancin' in a circle  
When I feel like this I can't resist  
I ? don't make me hurt you  
She said  
  
You got, you got, you got  
What it takes to make me leave my man

"The wind is howlin'  
The rain pours down  
Eyes are blood-shot  
Heartbeat pounds.  
Lights go out  
The whole world's in darkness  
The ground is tremblin'  
Dogs are barkless.  
In the sky there appears a great light  
Burnin' all the flesh off the creatures of the night.  
Cryin' in a childless tone  
Terrified of dyin' a painful death alone.  
Don't smile  
Lest a innocent Chile  
The power of God is gonna get to be your Tao  
Throw like a hit from the best  
Take it in a slump  
Ha ha  
Feel it in your chest.  
Conquering the world with the words  
Leading the children like herds.  
I can feel it building  
I'm about to explode  
I'm walking on the crossroad  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
People living in a shack, at the crossroads  
Little kids selling crack, at the crossroads  
Stab you in the back, at the crossroads  
Everybody's getting jacked at the crossroads  
  
Violins and trumpets play  
25 thousand people in a golden sleigh  
On there way to the promise land.  
Deliverance  
But yet some don't understand.  
Rough on a late night thrill  
After midnight  
Kill or be killed.  
Soldiers, warriors  
At each other  
On the combat zone.  
Supreme power on the throne.  
Lighting strikes in every home.  
Terrified men run down the street.  
So many dead bodies  
It's hard to eat.  
Come, we gotta rise  
Above the wall.  
To see what no man has seen before.  
Blindin' light  
That got you through the night.  
God is on your side  
To got in a fight.

Homicide  
Suicide  
Death.  
Boom!  
Ain't nobody left.  
Oh! It's starting to take affect.  
Your on your knees  
You scared to death.  
Tornado's with a thousand people spinning.  
One fight at the cross  
And now God is wining.  
The whole Earth cracks in half.  
The sea turns red from the blood bath.  
Abandoned buildings burned  
And two remain  
Terrified.  
You feel the fire blaze.  
The ground can't hold your weight.  
You reach out to grab the pearly gates.  
Who clocked this fuck  
Not from space.  
Never again  
Will you see the human race.  
19 angels leading the Devil straight to Hell!  
Torment!  
Pain!  
What you're seeing here  
You can't explain.  
All your life  
Some men  
We played the game.  
Never realize that there's a flame.

"His realm is a new horizon of cuts  
They expand from his hand as he conducts  
Aim a lot of cool projects not photography  
Cut-Creator, Philly-Phil's biography  
  
The lyrical virtual also makes his return  
All adversaries should be concerned  
LL Cool J is back again  
Let me allow to introduce you to my friend Cut-Creator  
  
He circumcises DJ's while he's on the airwaves  
Till the missions' complete, you're a musical slave  
English revision he endure any collision  
Like a searcher with a scalpel, he'll make the head decision  
As for me I'll annihilate, eggs, I'll let's 'em communicate  
You from rappin' and my lyrics are the best  
Slow down the rap but not the subject matter  
All you sucker DJ's will scatter  
Cut-Crea-tor will employ techniques that will absorb toy boy  
The real helper of cuts, Cut-Creator is his name  
The boys' so nice, my boat is your strain  
You could re-arrange but you don't have the brains  
To arrange scratch-padders for the audio change  
Not trippin' ah, my tree, for the mental geometry  
Just Cool J, that's me, I'm dangerous  
  
""I need a beat""  
  
Yeah I made it, don't look astonished  
I had to remind you of what I've accomplished  
My scenario, four-door stereo  
Up-bein' beat, zero is the ratio  
Cut-Creator, LL Cool J  
Say: ""Ole"", to what we just played  
Rappers who don't evade instead we invade  
And all competitors will be slayed  
Any comment is a compliment  
No groups' talent can be the equivalent  
Of mine and his combined  
Total harmony between the cuts and the rhyme  
So why listen the greats by the deaf of the bass  
Takin' out every sucker, DJin' the place  
A performance underrated, it's not narrated  
So Cut-Creators social statics can't be alleviated  
He's dangerous  
  
Demolishin' DJ's in under a second  
I called an old phrase from my last record  
The beat alleviates, the scratch excels  
Except I came hear to raise some hell  
Searchin' up sykes and cuts like the blade  
He the scuser dry-smudge and make Coolay  
I drink at steady, the record turns many  
Instead of a needle, he uses a machete  
He scuffs the bars a-get you involved as the record revolves  
DJ's dissolve, usually, physically, mentally  
He's an innovator, greater, Cut-Creator is on the cross-fader  
Sometime I gotta check what I invest  
All Farmers Boulevard is where I rest  
I'm numero uno, amigo with an ego  
Such palms kill a France, say, en Italiano  
The mouth protects and I'll inject into your ears  
A new concept cuts soon in silence to be unfair  
To the Cool J phenomena, all must hail  
I'm dangerous

"Yo Yvette, there's a lot of rumors goin' around  
They're so bad, baby you might have to skip town  
See something's smellin' fishy and they say it's you  
All I know is that you made it with the whole damn crew  
They say you're a man-eater during the full moon  
Mascot of the senior boys' locker room  
They said Yvette walked in, there wasn't too much rap  
Her reputation got bigger, and so did her gap  
Cause girl your momma should of taught you better  
I'ma sit down and write you a long letter.  
  
[Chorus]  
Dear Yvette  
Dear Yvette  
Dear Yvette  
Dear Yvette  
  
I'm glad you ain't my sister, then again if you was  
I'd have to treat you like you was my distant cause  
I'm not a news reporter, I don't mean to assume  
What should I think? I seen ya comin' out the men's bathroom  
You wasn't in there alone, wasn't usin' the phone  
The door was locked for twenty minutes, all I heard was ""Moan"".  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I don't really know if the story is so  
I can either ask Curly, or Larry or Moe  
Or Earl, Shabazz, Lou, Mookie or Joe  
Like Santa Claus said, you're a ho-ho-ho  
In every disco you say hello  
Like you're a little angel, but we all know  
Since you was eleven you been actin' this way  
You always got in bed when you wanted to play  
You're a freak, you think you're Lady Godiva  
Some freaks are live, but Yvette you're liver.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You're a back-seat queen, a elevator pro  
A high-powered body makes your Levis grow  
See the stories I've heard, they could amaze  
I heard she did it on a motorcycle back in the days  
So calm down freak, get a G.E.D.  
That's a General Education on Decency  
One day you'll see, and agree with me  
Unless you're gonna be a freak until you're 93  
For you there's no fee, everything is free  
This is from me to you, not you to me  
Every night is your night, your leather pants are tight  
You try to shake your butt with all your might  
I don't really wanna dis nobody  
You might think I had a little too much Bacardi  
But that's not the problem, the problem's Yvette  
How bad can a girl's reputation get?  
See she's the kinda girl all the homeboys met  
If you're desperate ask Yvette, cause she'll say ""Bet"".  
  
[Chorus]  
  
B-Boys are hard on the boulevard  
The Reverend at the church said you was barred  
Homeboys on the block love you a lot  
You're a real famous freak whether you like it or not  
So before you start walking and your beak starts squawkin'  
Let me explain to you who is talkin'  
I'm L.L. Cool J from around the way  
You boogie down to my records almost every day  
Go a hundred miles an hour when you're standin' still  
You're faster than my Caddy when it's goin' downhill  
Won't forget that day in the Y.M.C.A.  
The guy at the desk said it was OK  
For you to come inside cuz he knew you'd stay  
Greg G. and Garfield yelled ""Hooray""

Smack DJ's and tell the seated girls please

One sample is ample, four emcees'll get trampled  
Bein' absent from God, I'ma give you sample

So what your name in the bituary  
Step back the conqueror spreads his wings

When I rock, hearts roll on and walk bad

Just like a bloodhound but I got this spellbound

Camcorder in the whole shit, press rewind, let it flow on screen  
While we puff the L, laying back in the cut while we're under the spell.  
Word life, I like the way the end go down,  
Go to sleep tomorrow I'll take ya back downtown  
We'll be  
  
[Chorus:Repeat x2]  
  
DefJam, Baby Criss, Big Shawn, Word is born,  
Make it hot.  
Uh, DefJam, LeShaun, Baby Criss, Big Shawn, Rock On  
Go Brooklyn, Go Brooklyn, Go Brooklyn, Go Brooklyn, Go Brooklyn

"Yeah, uh-huh  
I can't believe it  
  
[Chorus]  
Finally I'm walking down that aisle  
No need for the coping now  
I found the perfect partner waiting for me at the altar  
Made a vow before God to love me  
And finally I'm walking down that aisle  
I will never second guess us how  
When we're laughing together, and we're crying together  
Having kids together, my life begins right now  
  
Finally the day has arrived  
I'm standing at the altar, you're walking down the aisle  
My heart skips a beat, emotions run wild  
Half of me is crying, the other half smiles  
I can feel my stomach turnin' and tossin' and goin' through it  
I just can't believe it, I'm really 'bout to do it  
Take the vow to be together forever  
Plus promise I'ma be there, whenever, wherever  
Through the ups and downs, through the darkest clouds  
Side by side in the rain 'til the sun comes out  
I was blind to love, God showed me you  
Now I'm standin' here shakin 'bout to say ""I do""  
And I do  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Butterflies, my palms are sweaty  
It's a lifetime commitment, I pray that I'm ready  
But your eyes tell me not to worry, you're sincere  
Can't turn back now, destiny's why I'm here  
Our friends laugh as I take you by the hand  
But they single and this a feeling that they don't understand  
You're my partner for life, I'ma treat you right  
Our honeymoon's forever, not just tonight  
Knew the time was right, to be husband and wife  
Us both dressed alike in the purest white  
Such a beautiful gown, friends and family around  
Ignore the cold feet now, time to take these vows  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's a beautiful and heavenly day  
As the pastor asks, ""Who gives this woman away?""  
Your father says ""I do"" and gives me a hand  
Plus the tough guy, and I completely understand  
He losin' a diamond and now you're mine and  
He don't have to worry, I'm a keep you shinin'  
I'm a build us a future, I'm a keep on climbin'  
With our family on my back, cause that's my assignment  
I'm a work overtime, make sure y'all live  
But still find time for you and homework with the kids  
Took a long time to learn, I was so hardheaded  
But you stuck with me and you won't regret it, ""I do""  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And I do (I do)  
Baby I do (I do)  
Baby I do  
We made a vow baby  
I do (I do)  
Baby I do (I do)  
Baby I do  
Find that perfect partner, yeah yeah (I do)  
Waiting for me at the altar  
And I make a vow before God to love you  
Finally I'm walking down that aisle  
I'll, never second guess you

"Just like Pauline you all-in  
  
Oh,  
Brace yourself, I'm the ace with grace  
I'ma win the race and make you feel disgrace  
In any case, yo, I'm moving like a steeplechase  
MC soldiers, about face  
Now step off, I need room for my takeoff  
My custom made lyrics slays, yours are soft  
I think you better tape this, yo, you can't escape this  
Yo, I planned it out just like a landscapist  
Whipper-snapper back up for coming crap up  
I plan to trap a MC and kidnap em  
Phony, so skip the baloney  
You and your cronies need to jump on a pony  
And roll, cause you're just a rookie  
When it was time for rap school, you must of played hooky  
I'm the show-stopper, your rhymes are improper  
I'ma teach you like the master taught the grasshopper  
Just getting warmer, I'm a transform a  
Regular rhyme into a barnstormer  
Try to jump I'll bump you chump, my job is thorough  
Any MC, state city or borough'll get ragged  
I drop like a sandbag  
Serious as the mob, I don't play tag  
Best of the batch, no man can catch up  
Hoes can't be passed, a battle's a mis match  
I flip lyrics, like a acrobat  
And avoid combat like a diplomat  
But when it's time for back lash, jacked or killed  
It's a thrill to drill a run of the mill Bill  
With my skill, I'm the lord of the rhymes  
And I be writing at a rate that pace way past my bedtime  
I rock the mic unlike  
Some brothers I know, I guess they flow, pysch!  
I'm dropping 'em  
  
Dropping 'em  
  
Yo, you're all in, stiff as a mannequin  
I'm sharp as a pen and I'ma teach discipline  
I get busy like it's two of me  
Evidently, I'm hated by a few MC's  
But so what? I just max like I'm playing the sax  
And take the crowd to the climax  
Yo, Cool J, I'll never go astray  
I'm funky you can hear me at the Milky Way  
You're weak, wick raps, I'm cool as jazz  
Got razzmatazz ask my man Shabazz  
I know you're afraid because I'm self-made  
I invade, and blow up like a hand grenade  
MC's are terror-struck, I'ma run amuck  
Cause your rhymes suck, you made a record on potluck  
Just a toy boy, can't stop my convoy  
Rhymes I said last year were just decoys  
I'm like a fox, you annoy me like chicken pox  
I'm back with a style that's unorthodox  
You must of had a teaspoon full of bull  
I'm like The Hulk, with more bulk, I'm powerful  
They try to get with this, to me that's an insult  
Boys shouldn't mess with an adult, that's too difficult  
I enter like a giant saying fee fi foe fum  
Then rock the auditorium until it's pandemonium  
I'm dropping 'em  
  
Yo E, dropping 'em  
  
Don't sleep, cause I'ma go deeper  
All you sleepers, I'm the Grim Reaper  
My rhymes are rising, the angle's getting steeper  
I hated Mussolini Martini so I'ma sweep a  
Emcee, like he's one of the two  
Break him into fragments right in front of you  
Mic check one two, is too fundamental  
My rhymes are monumental over an instrumental  
In the center, I had to enter  
Tormentor mentor experimenter and inventor  
Of lyrics, so all you non-believers  
It'll echo in your dreams at night when you receive a  
Rude awakening, you can't do anything  
You enter my kingdom and you cry as men bring  
Gifts to the prince of excellence and magnificence  
Alarm clock rings, you wake up, and you're convinced  
That the crew invader, soloist exterminator  
Greater evader of ducks, concert crusader  
Is bad, my nickname's the circuit breaker  
Eating up the world, acre by acre  
I'm dropping 'em  
  
Word to mother, dropping 'em!  
Know what I'm saying? Straight til 1999, dropping 'em!  
Yo, year two thousand, ya know what I'm saying?  
Audi man  
  
Yo I'm dropping 'em

"(Sip somethin')  
Uh, sip somethin'  
(Sip somethin')  
I wouldn't drink that, if I was you  
  
[Chorus]  
With every sip of my drink (uh)  
I get a little bit closer (uh-huh)  
And when I'm tryin' to re-think (yeah)  
I can't really get focused (uh, uh)  
I wasn't tryin' to be mean  
I can see that it's hopeless (uh)  
Cause your persistence overpowers me  
I know you rollin' out with me  
  
I was stayin' at the Shore Club, leanin' in the red room  
Seen this tan mami, she was fresh off the sand dunes  
Big bottles and models and poom-pooms  
Surroundin' my table, watchin' me like cable  
My Dolce hat was low, Versace shades  
Had the Prada shoes on 'cause the world is a stage  
Lah-lah in the air, it's a sky bar affair  
The glamorous life, I had my glass in the air  
When my eyes connected with somethin' real real nice  
Like she finished her drink and started chewin' on my ice  
Her smile was bananas, teeth was pearly white  
That's when I realized it'll be a long night  
The vibe was right, she was laced in all white  
Her French manicure traced the crown on my mic  
You ever try to focus, resist with all your might  
But every sip you take pulls you deeper in the hype  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm talkin' tan lines, belly rings and things  
DJ rubbin' my thing, makin' my head swing  
All the honies was schemin'  
Cause the rocks in my ears was gleamin', oh God I must be dreamin'  
My vision was blurry, the party was rockin  
The tools was knockin, honey want to get it poppin'  
Try my best to chill, she was fresh out of Brazil  
People was walkin' by makin' our drinks filled  
What would you do, if you was a Don  
In a position to wild out with a Brazilian blond?  
Or maybe you a honey and it's hard to keep calm  
Cause you sippin' on somethin' and homeboy's the bomb  
You dancin' in your seat, and singin' along  
And every sip makes you feel like you need to perform  
The party is packed, it's just a little too warm  
But you take another sip to prove that you strong  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Take it to the bridge  
  
I can't call it, I can't tell  
Honestly, I'm drunk as hell (uh-huh)  
And me, I can not believe (lay back baby)  
This night out is windin' down (uh)  
You keep buyin' all these rounds for me (aw man)  
I know what you want from me (yeah)  
I know what you want  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Rollin out with me (roll out)  
Rollin out with me (uh, roll out)  
Roll out (roll out)

"I swear to tell the truth and nothing but the truth,  
So help me GOD  
I just felt like telling the story of my life  
Felt like, maybe somebody could be inspired, you know?  
We all feel pain, we all go through things  
But it's time to overcome all that  
  
If your plane crashed in the water and everybody died  
Would you drown on purpose or try to survive?  
I was born handicapped my arm wouldn't move  
They called me a cripple pops caught an attitude  
Beat my moms smoked lye drove trucks  
My moms had a miscarriage, he didn't give a fuck  
He sniffed some coke, come home  
Beat up on my moms cause she's talkin' on the phone  
Come on

Moms got tired of the beatings said, ""Yo, we got to go""  
Packed up her bags we bounced out the do'  
She said, ""I ain't taking these whippin's no mo'  
I want to live to see my little Todd grow""  
I remember tear drops on my pops face  
Looking down at me standing on the staircase  
Handsome brother with a smooth goatee  
Makes me wonder why he act so ugly, you feeling me?  
(I'm feeling you)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
My pops got drunk when me and my moms bounced  
Swigged some Jack Dan', sniffed up a ounce  
Grabbed the shotty left Long Isle for Queens  
Possessed by a demon, a devil it seemed  
I was too young to understand the risk  
When your moms come home off the midnight shift  
She turned around heard the shotgun click  
My pops said, ""You think that you could leave me?""  
He blasted my moms in the back  
She fell down screaming I can't forget that  
My grandfather tried to close the do'  
He got shot ten times in the stomach yo, for real  
  
[Chorus]  
  
My head was spinning, I had never seen blood  
Four years old, this don't feel like love  
Anyway, pops disappeared  
Grandpops and moms healed up over the years  
This therapist got up in her head  
Led her to believe without him she'd be dead  
You know, they fell in love with one another  
Everything seemed right that's word to mother  
Until I started getting beatings everyday  
Sometimes for going outside to play  
Late at night on my knees I'd pray  
A young child, wishing the pain would go away  
Dad where was you when he made me strip  
Beat with belts like a slave with a whip  
Kicked me down steps outside in the snow  
Punched me in the chest stomped me out on the flo'  
That's just the tip of the iceberg look  
It's too long for a song but perfect for a book  
Word is bond, that's real baby

"Uh-huh, eh-heh  
Lay back on this one (yeah, you know how I do baby)  
  
You only a customer  
When you walkin' in the presence of hustlers  
Uh, I'm laid back in the cinnamon Range  
Two decades and ain't a damn thing changed  
Keep my girl, in strawberry swirls  
You can taste it, my instict's basic  
Lord have mercy, sweet like Hershey  
Kisses, diamonds for the misses, ices on the wrist-es  
All different colors of the spectrum  
The smallest flaw and I reject 'em  
Believe me I'm a connoisseur when I inspect 'em  
I baguettes them, invisibly sets them  
They call me big L-ly Wonka from Compton to Yonkers  
Them Chi-Town steppers and them A-Town stompers  
These young rookies, fail to understand  
Every sumer I return like the ice cream man  
Drop what you doin', get-it get-it while you can  
By the eighth, by the ounce, when it's gone I'ma bounce  
It's the F-L-A-V, no if's or maybe's  
You know what I do, drive your taste buds crazy  
  
[Chorus]  
Like lemon drops with chocolate kisses  
Every bite is more delicious  
My favorite flavor

Like caramel on vanilla sundae  
Have a scoop you'll want some day  
Cause you're my favorite flavor  
(C'mon, baby baby c'mon) c'mon  
  
My flavor's unreal  
Smooth but hard like wood grain on the wheel  
Recline your seat baby, enjoy how it feel  
Why you crossin' your legs, them high heels of eel?  
Kick off your shoes, run your toes on the dash  
Now peel off your stockings, c'mon let's get it poppin'  
I'm in the mood for cotton, candy and I'm plottin'  
To see you in somethin' silky and see-through  
Me too! Man you know how we do  
Camcorder main feature, damn a preview  
I love how the bottom on your body's EQ  
Low but thick though like the base in a six-fo'  
So here we go (here we go) we bunny hoppin'  
I hit the switches baby, you keep it droppin'  
It feels marvelous, you in charge of this  
I hope you ain't heartless but my guard's now regardless

All I wanna do  
Is show you boy that I taste good too  
(I know you taste good ma)  
(What'chu sayin', want a sprinkle of the hood ha? Ha?)  
  
We had it out  
Now tell your girls the truth when they ask what I'm about  
The cookies and the cream and the peaches 'n praline

When you talk like a baller you tickle me with it  
But yeah there's money out there come on lets get it  
But I'm a get it in such a way you never forget it  
Let's go twenty platinum albums in a row  
Sixty thousand fans a three hour show  
I could care less who drop and blow  
My name is LL baby that's beyond the flow  
  
Uh yes yes y'all feel the beat y'all  
Freak freak y'all

These rap cats get upset with me  
When security clear out the V.I.P  
If honey want to lounge we gone see ID  
Ain't no negotiating you gone pay my fee  
I'm the boss I call the shots to keep it hot  
I don't have competition I'm bigger than the slot  
While you waste advances on gray market rocks  
I cop municipal bonds and Wal Mart stocks  
A family man but hard as a rock  
And I die for my kids so stay off my block  
They might be impressed with you but I'm not  
After all these years I still walk with a bop  
Still keep the ink hot  
Still scheme like a fox  
Still ready to battle  
You don't want your career stopped  
Industry shocked 'cause I mapped out a plot  
And ran around humble with my joint on cock  
  
Uh yes yes y'all feel the beat y'all  
Freak freak y'all  
You don't stop

"Check it out  
I break a nigga down ugly like Coke, up on the scale  
Next step throw a stack up on the third rail  
The undisputed, I'm never ever diluted or polluted  
You could fuse it, if ya choose it 'cause it's deep rooted  
I make ya maggot ass crawl out the gutter  
For underestimating as I'm creating the butter  
Cliques get clipped like heavy bricks when I'm dropping  
I'm wrecking nigga whole shit plus I make a profit  
Wicked with this shout, bodies are fished out  
I'm wrecking niggas one-by-one but then I miscount  
Mispronounced, how do LL bounce  
And get ya shit bust? I turn ya fagots into mush  
Ya slipping, I'm gripping microphones real tight  
Then I crack up the speakers in ya Ac all night  
Deliver messages, the prophecy's in me  
His Royal Highness, you minus what you claim to be

Uh, I get da drop on you niggas  
I blow it, I make it hot for my niggas  
  
I blow em, kaboom, but fuck sound effects  
Niggas was sleeping like I was off on a Star Trek  
Select my dialect, inspect all my checks  
He claim he getting money but L cast the cheque  
You sell blunt weed, Glock block, horizons  
Niggas in the projects find ya hypnotizing  
You clowns know when I bring forth the heat  
Hardcore niggas be wearing panties, looking sweet  
I'm on a journey through the land of fronting niggas  
Nervous motherfuckers with the hands on dirty triggers  
I lay back, niggas beef or let my nuts live  
I take my blade, insert it until ya guts give  
Execution, the destroyer of ya suspect bunch  
What? Drama! You can't believe how I deliver bomb shit  
Ya brains split, the pain hits ya little dick

You falling backwards, leaning like a dope addict  
Rope niggas claim me, packing automatics  
Found his ol' Earth's burner underneath the mattress  
Go outside, the bitch up just like a actress  
I take ya motherfuckers one-by-one and show ya how it's done  
And dick ya down in front of everyone  
Bitch niggas ain't got no type of reason  
To say a bullshit rhyme in LL season  
I'm freezing, ya bleeding heavily up out'cha rectum  
Black and blue, trying ta hide up in the spectrum  
I got ya raw ass busting straight flat  
Head up on the place mat, ready to waste that  
Operating incorporates stimulating designs  
Lay that motherfucker's shit down, nigga resign  
Don't lose ya mind, concentrating on how I shine  
You never hear a nigga like me, never in time  
I blaze it quick, amaze cliques when I flip  
I can't believe you niggas forgot who rip shit  
It's '96 and niggas like to hold they dicks  
I'm breaking shit aside ya doctor's can't fix

Fuck the tricks and all them smooth singing grooves  
I'm bringing crews, in my ring you swing and lose  
With the blues light my fuse, allow me  
To show ya crab ass fake niggas how it be  
My technique's superb when I'm pissing on these herbs  
Crystal clear so you can hear every word  
Fuck the goodie-goodie or your moms might hear it  
I gotta keep my title locked down so niggas fear it  
Uh, I get da drop on you niggas  
I blow it, I make it hot for my niggas

It's all fogged up, face me baby

There is something that I want to say to you  
You've been on my mind now  
For a while and I just don't know what to do  
I've been thinking of holding you (holding you)  
Showing you, what I'm all about  
And I promise that I will do  
Everything you want without a doubt  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Mashonda]  
I know  
That we've  
Had our share of ups and downs but that's in the past  
If you promise to hold me down  
Then our love will have a second chance to last  
I've been thinking of holding you  
Showing you, what I'm all about  
(And I promise) And I promise that I will do  
Everything you want without a doubt

[LL Cool J]  
Forget the past  
We like Bonnie and Clyde from now on  
Back to back, through the ups and downs  
Right or wrongs, lay down  
Let me kiss you all down your back  
Then I'll go further down, swirl my tongue around  
I apologize too  
For not recognizing the pain inside of you  
I never lie to you, again  
Last time had stress on my mind  
Had a hard time believing  
That my girl could be genuine  
It's different now, we ghetto lovers fo' real  
I grab the wheel, you hold the steel  
Teach me how to touch you where you like it the most  
From now on, til we give up the ghost

And I hope the phone's tapped, let's pretend you on my lap

Tales from the hood, your boyz will feel terror  
MC's contaminatin' tracks with feces  
You think of pussy until a flick like Species  
Hi-tech, ya, my pen got velocity  
Jumpin' out the SSL like Virtuosity

Her ass is classic

Servin' a Justice  
Poetic the way I last it  
I touch ground, real windy, with my lyrics  
Make her talk in tongues, and feel the Holy Spirit  
Hear it, pulling light strings  
Got mad cast a swing  
When I do my thing, my ballz is hairy like the Lion King  
I'm in the jungle, layin' down my mack

Good love, have fun, tight hugs and flowers  
I have your girl runnin' off to fake baby showers  
Better get down before ya cryin' at home

Some brother's won't appreciate that  
Ain't it scary when you meet a real mack?

See the flavors in my lifestyle, chill don't even lie to me  
Balls a lethal weapon, dick a menace to society  
You ain't a player-hater, kid, you took her off restriction

Please be his ex and be my bride  
Don't blame it on yourself, sweet thing, you tried  
Love you claimed to share just wasn't there  
You're too good for that, and it wasn't fair  
Love's taken its toll, your heart he stole  
You was fooled by the face of a phoney role  
But I'll take up the slack, support you, baby  
Now the knight in shiny armor can only be me  
I cry out your name as you hold his hand  
If you're not mine soon, girl, my soul is damned  
I'm looking out the window at the stormy rain  
And the rush of the water makes my eyes drain  
All alone in the room, and it's making me sad  
Fantasize of the love we could have had  
Cause I never met anyone like you before  
And I can give you more  
  
I pour wine for two, even though it's just me  
I tried to reach you, but blind men don't see  
Your man is the devil, but he gave you a ring  
So you believe you saw an innocent angel sing  
You're the type that ignores the destiny of two  
It's not Romeo and Juliet, it's me and you  
You're being handicapped by a Don Juan rap  
You can hope I disappear, girl, but I'll be back  
Cause I never met anyone like you before  
And I can give you more  
Yes girl, I never met anyone like you before  
And I can give you more  
  
The time has come, the decision's yours  
This super love story ain't working no more  
Can't you understand that my love spans  
Higher and further than any man's  
You're looking a gift horse right in the mouth  
This time hear me out, I don't care if you pout  
You're my only desire, I fight to the death  
And I'ma scream your name when I breathe my last breath  
Ain't getting on my knees, but I'm oh so close  
To our love I toast, all he does is boast  
Cause I never met anyone like you before  
And I can give you more  
  
A knock on the door and a tap on the glass  
Tells me you see it my way at last  
You used to reject me, now you wanna kiss me  
He called you up and said, ""Yo baby, why you diss me?""  
Meanwhile made romance on the sea shore  
You want more of what you used to ignore  
During this love affair, girl, it gets steamy  
Three nights in a row, and you still wanna see me  
Make love at night, coffee in the morn'  
I be the only blanket that's keepin you warm  
Cause I never met anyone like you before  
And I can give you more  
  
I hoot in the morning to the crack of sunlight  
But my agony continues till it reaches night  
Sweet image of your face appears on the wall  
And the scene is so eerie I run through the hall  
I look at the sky, then I search for the moon  
Realize it's 3 o'clock in the afternoon  
So I dress to impress, exit the house  
Go up to the school and watch the kids come out  
In the middle of the court yard there you stand  
With the man who's deceiving ya, holding your hand  
Cause I never met anyone like you before  
And I can give you more  
  
You're the goddess of light, the queen of seduction  
You won't get used if you follow my instructions  
Your scram my hand, feel the sweat on my palm  
Make love to a man and not a cheap Don Juan  
And that'll be eroticism, highs die down  
You will find your best friend finally is found  
I caress ya at night like a virgin in white  
Cause the new world I found is oh so tight  
And tender and young, soft and wet  
It's hotter than any fantasy could get  
Cause I never met anyone like you before  
And I can give you more

"My radio, believe me, I like it loud  
I'm the man with a box that can rock the crowd  
Walkin' down the street, to the hardcore beat  
While my JVC vibrates the concrete  
I'm sorry if you can't understand  
But I need a radio inside my hand  
Don't mean to offend other citizens  
But I kick my volume way past 10  
My story is rough, my neighborhood is tough  
But I still sport gold, and I'm out to crush  
My name is Cool J, I devastate the show  
But I couldn't survive without my radio  
Terrorizing my neighbors with the heavy bass  
I keep the suckers in fear by the look on my face  
My radio's bad from the Boulevard  
I'm a hip-hop gangster and my name is Todd  
Just stimulated by the beat, bust out the rhyme  
Get fresh batteries if it won't rewind  
Cause I play everyday, even on the subway  
I would of got a summons but I ran away  
I'm the leader of the show, keepin' you on the go  
But I know I can't live without my radio  
  
Suckers on my jock when I walk down the block  
I really don't care if you're jealous or not  
Cause I make the songs, you sing along  
And your radio's def when my record's on  
So get off the wall, become involved  
All your radio problems have now been solved  
My treacherous beats make ya ears respond  
And my radio's loud like a fire alarm  
The floor vibrates, the walls cave in  
The bass makes my eardrums seem thin  
Def sounds in my ride, yes the front and back  
You would think it was a party, not a Cadillac  
Cause I drive up to the ave, with the windows closed  
And my bass is so loud, it could rip your clothes  
My stereo's thumpin' like a savage beast  
The level on my power meter will not decrease  
Suckers get mad, cause the girlies scream  
And I'm still gettin' paid while you look at me mean  
I'm the leader of the show, keepin' you on the go  
But I know I can't live without my radio  
I'm the leader of the show, keepin' you on the go  
And I know I can't live without my radio  
  
Don't touch that dial, I'll be upset  
Might go into a fit and rip off your neck  
Cause the radio's thumpin' when I'm down to play  
I'm the royal chief rocker LL Cool J  
Let your big butt bounce from right to left  
Cause it's a actual fact this jam is def  
Most definitely created by me  
Goin' down in radio history  
I'm good to go on your radio  
And I'm cold gettin' paid cause Rick said so  
Make the woofers wallop and your tweeters twitch  
Some jealous knuckleheads might try to dis  
But it's nothin', ya frontin', ya girl I am stuntin'  
And my radio's loud enough to keep you gruntin'

Circulating through your radio non-stop  
I'm lookin' at the wires behind the cassette  
And now I'm on the right, standing on the eject  
Wearin' light blue Pumas, a whole lot of gold  
And jams like these keep me in control  
I'm the leader of the show, keepin' you on the go  
And I know I can't live without my radio  
  
Your energy level starts to increase  
As my big beat is slowly released  
I'm on the radio and at the jam  
LL Cool J is who I am  
I'ma make ya dance, boogie down and rock  
And you'll scratch and shake to my musical plot  
And to expand my musical plan  
Cut Creator, rock the beat with your hands  
  
That's right, so don't try to front the move  
As you become motivated by the funky groove  
You can see me and Earl chillin' on the block  
With my box cold kickin' with the gangster rock  
See people can't stop me, neither can the police  
I'm a musical maniac to say the least  
For you and your radio I made this for  
Cool J's here to devastate once more  
Pullin' all the girls, takin' out MCs  
If ya try to disrespect me, I just say Please!  
Here to command the hip-hop land  
Kick it live with a box inside my hand  
I'm the leader of the show, keepin' you on the go  
But I know I can't live without my radio  
  
Farmers Boulevard, yeah, you know that's where me and E hang out,

"When I'm alone in my room  
Sometimes I stare at the wall  
And in the back of my mind  
I hear my conscience call  
Telling me I need a girl who's as sweet as a dove  
For the first time in my life, I see I need love  
There I was, giggling about the games  
That I had played with many hearts and I'm not saying no names  
Then the thought occurred, Tear drops made my eyes burn  
As I said to myself, ""Look what you've done to her""  
I can feel it inside, I can't explain how it feels  
All I know is that I'll never dish another raw deal  
Playing make believe, pretending that I'm true  
Holding in my laugh as I say that I love you  
Saying amore, kissing you on the ear  
Whispering ""I love you"" and ""I'll always be near""  
Although I often reminisce, I can't believe that I've found  
A desire for true love, floating around  
Inside my soul, because my soul is cold  
One half of me deserves to be this way till I'm old  
But the other half, needs affection and joy  
And the warmth that is created by a girl and a boy  
I need love  
  
I need love  
  
Romance, sheer delight, how sweet  
I've got to find me a girl to make my life complete  
You can scratch my back, we'll get cozy and huddle  
I'll lay down my jacket so you can walk over a puddle  
Give you a rose, pull out your chair before we eat  
Kiss you on the cheek and say ""Ooh girl, you're so sweet""  
It's De Ja Vu, whenever I'm with you  
I can go on forever telling you what I'll do  
But where you at? You're neither here nor there  
I swear, I can't find you anywhere  
Damn sure you ain't in my closet, or under my rug  
This love search, is really making me bugged  
And if you know who you are, why don't you make yourself seen?  
Take a chance with my love and you'll find out what I mean  
Fantasies can run, but they can't hide  
And when I find you I'ma pour all my love inside  
I need love  
  
I need love  
  
I wanna kiss you, hold you, never scold you, just love you  
Suck on your neck, caress you and rub you  
Grind, mold, and never be alone  
If you're not standing next to me you're on the phone  
Can't you hear it in my voice? I need love bad  
I've got money but love's something I never had  
I need your ruby red lips, sweet face and all  
I love you more than a man, who's ten feet tall  
I watch the sun rise, in your eyes  
We're so in love, when we hug, we become paralyzed  
Our bodies explode in extacy unreal  
You're as soft as a pillow and I'm as hard as steel  
It's like a dream land, I can't lie, I've never been there  
Maybe this is an experience that me and you can share  
Clean and unsoiled, yet sweaty and wet  
I swear to you, this is something I'll never forget  
I need love  
  
I need love  
  
See what I mean? I've changed, I'm no longer  
A playboy on the run, I need something that's stronger  
Friendship, trust, honor respect, admiration  
This whole experience has been such a revelation  
It's taught me love, and how to be a real man  
To always be considerate and do all I can  
Protect you, you're my lady and you mean so much  
My body tingles all over with the slightest touch  
Of your hand, and understand, I'll be frozen in time  
Till we meet face to face and you tell me you're mine  
If I find you girl, I swear I'll be a good man  
I'm not gonna leave it, in destiny's hand  
I can't sit and wait, for my princess to arrive  
I gotta struggle and fight, to keep my dream alive  
I'd search the whole world for that special girl  
And when I finally find you, watch our love unfurl  
I need love  
  
I need love  
  
Girl, listen to me.  
When I be sitting in my room, all alone, staring at the wall,  
Fantasies, they go through my mind.  
And, I've come to realize that, I need true love.  
And if you want to give it to me girl, make yourself seen.  
I'll be waiting, I love you.

It was love at first sight  
I know from the way she looked at me  
Her eyes said it all  
Long days and nights, we spent  
Until she dropped the bomb on me  
When she said that she  
Was unhappily married with children  
  
1 - And I wish I never met her at all  
Even though I love her so  
But she got love for me  
But she still belongs to someone else  
  
It hurts so bad, for sure  
Because she wants to be with me  
But she cannot be with me  
She chose to stay-hey at home  
So they could be a family  
For the children  
But what about me?

Even if it means I got to take my time

From some long forgotten game  
It makes my blood boil  
Turns my eyes to flames  
I built an empire  
They tried to kick me out in the rain  
So I called on an inner power  
It's hard to explain  
It's like a holy spirit  
Utilizing hip hop slang  
I'm beyond the gold grills  
And logos on chains  
You see I changed rap forever  
I elevated the game  
Launched the greatest label  
In the history of rap  
And for twenty four years  
I carried it on my back  
I've always shined brighter  
When I'm under attack  
I might be down for a moment  
But I always come back  
  
[Chorus]  
It's time for war  
It's time for war  
It's time for war  
It's time for war (Uh, yeah)  
It's time for war  
It's time for war  
It's time for war  
It's time for war (Check it)  
It's time for war  
  
This is a resurrection  
I'm back from the dead  
They told me quit a long time ago  
But I conquered instead  
I had dreams and visions  
Swirling around in my head  
I had this hunger deep inside of me  
That has to be fed  
Hip hop will respect  
All the blood that I shed  
I have a covenant with God  
I have swallowed the bread  
Hip hop my co-defendant  
With this mic I thee wed  
I made an entire generation  
Obey what we said  
I'm talkin' France to Germany  
From Italy to Japan  
From London to Belgium  
To Afghanistan  
From Farmers Boulevard  
Smokin' a blunt with my man  
To writin' rhymes on a ironing board  
To build Def Jam  
You see, I'm the undisputed  
King of all hip hop  
Everything after is my legacy  
Like it or not  
And I will keep making history  
I can't stop  
LL Cool J  
Eternally hot  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Look at how easily I flipped it  
And switched the style around  
Competition losin' their footing  
I see them falling down  
They will plot against me  
It kills them because I'm ballin' now  
Some of y'all didn't pick up the phone  
But I got you callin' now  
This is a job that must get done  
Even if I become public enemy number one  
If I had to pick up an Uzi  
That weighs over a ton  
I will attack hip hop  
Until competition is none  
Nobody on God's earth wants it with L  
You end up tortured  
And trapped in psychological hell  
And this is the beginning  
Of a new era in rap  
LL Cool J, feel the impact  
It's okay if you call it a comeback  
And let them know  
I'm ready for combat  
Tell those dumb motherfuckers to fall back  
The crown looks wrong on your head  
I want that  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's time for war  
  
It's time for war

"Just starin' at these four walls closin'  
In on me, feelin' like time's frozen  
Fadin' in and out, noddin' and dozin'  
Guilt tearin' up my brain like erosion  
What I did to you was wrong I admit it  
I regret that I did it like a junkie when he's jonzin'  
All alone in what used to be a home  
But you packed up our joy in that bag you put your clothes in  
The voice mail that you left me was scoldin'  
Hot enough to burn a hole in a cauldron  
Cause it was all true, that's why we all through  
Now your girl's pickin' up the cell when I call you  
Talkin' slick like she ain't here  
She don't want you no more, punk disappear, click  
I need to hit her with a brick  
But that'll only lead me to a worse predicament  
I hope your girlfriend ain't got you on a liquor binge  
With her bitter attitude just cause she's sick of men  
But I'ma keep on callin', fightin' 'til the end  
On my knees 'til they bleed, to prove my love again  
  
[Chorus]  
I sit in front of yo' crib in the pourin' rain  
Whylin' out screamin' yo' name  
And keepin' ringin' yo' bell 'til you mad as hell  
And call the po'-po', I ain't afraid (yeah, yeah)  
You can get yo' folks and yo' cousins and them  
And try to run me off yo' blocka (uh-huh)  
But I ain't scared, I ain't goin nowhere  
And I ain't stoppin 'til I gotcha  
To show you I changed shawty  
  
I seen you at the movies with some tall cat  
So I bust his headlights with a ball bat  
When I was with you he would give me dap and all that  
Now you in his arms in the mall, what you call that?  
That's what I get for creepin' and crawlin'  
Every other weekend gone until the mornin'  
Sneakin' out to my dirt, dead wrong  
Comin' back past dawn with the guilty mask on  
And I never counted the cost, took heed to warnings  
Try to hurt a rose you get pricked by a thorn  
And it don't feel nice, when you wake up nights  
Shakin' in cold sweats and your whole life's a wreck  
That was the old me, the one I still regret  
The one you couldn't respect, the one you should forget  
But I'ma keep on callin', fightin' 'til the end  
On my knees 'til they bleed, to prove my love again  
  
[Chorus]  
  
To show you I changed shawty  
I really did change shawty (I'm tellin' you I've changed)  
I wanna show you I changed shawty  
(i still love you!) [cars peel]  
  
I don't care if the cops got me surrounded  
Swat teams whatever, tell 'em to send the hounds in  
My mind's in an altered state  
Like I'm headed for a wall, top speed, foot off the brake  
I make a fool of myself, girl whatever it takes  
I already played the fool when I let you escape  
You're as, good as it gets, your friendship your sex  
Everything about you and yours connects  
From your, beautiful smile to the scent of your skin  
The sheets smell different, this is not livin'  
It feels like dyin', god knows I'm tryin'  
Ain't no sight sadder than a grown man cryin'  
Please find it in your heart to forgive me  
Realize only god can convict me  
We all make mistakes, so have you  
If god show mercy on me, then you should too  
  
[Chorus]  
  
To show you I changed shawty  
I really did change shawty (i'm tellin' you I've changed)  
I wanna show you I changed shawty  
(I still love you!) ow!

"Milky, and I'm back  
My ace in the hole was this brand new track  
I'ma slow it up and speed it up and now you're gonna eat it up  
Listen to the funky beat, my tongue is gonna beat it up  
I did it, but the devil didn't make me  
I did it for the suckers who tried to shake and bake me  
Proving a point that I'm a serious joint  
You can roll me up and puff me, and then I'll anoint  
Your head with oil--lots of oil  
Make it run like water, watch it boil  
'Cause I made 'em play it, made 'em say it  
Made 'em okay it, made 'em obey it---huh!  
Prince of the growl is on the prowl  
How you like me now punk? You living foul  
Here's what my game is, here is what my aim is  
A washed up rapper needs a washer, my name is--

Jack the Ripper  
Jack-Jack-Jack the Ripper  
Jack-Jack, Jack-Jack, Jack-Jack, Jack the Ripper  
King Hercules!  
  
Back for the payback, I must say that  
I heard your new jam, I don't play that  
It ain't loud enough punk, it ain't hitting  
This year you tried, next year you're quitting  
Last year you thought I was dying out  
But again, and again, and again without a doubt  
It's the gangster boogie, the earthquake sound  
Pump it up and play it so they hear it all around  
I do it up rough, tough, I don't bluff  
And this is an example of funky stuff  
When you want to make hits, you make 'em like this  
They ain't like this they don't hit, they miss  
It's a strong record, a record for the strong  
For those who appreciate real rap songs  
Listen how I won't allow myself to go off track  
Stay back, I got the power, I'm--  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Jack the Ripper, a man, not a myth  
A-k-a James Todd Smith  
Hard like penitentiary steel  
Breaking necks while I flex my sex appeal  
Home girls in the house, see'mon  
Home girls in the house, give it up  
You gotta want to get hotter  
Moving and grooving, and always improving a lot of  
People don't know how nice I am  
People sleeping, so now I gotta slice my man  
Like ham in a pan, wrap him up in Saran  
Kidnap him and slap him up inside of a van  
While you're doing your dance I want you to make moves  
Don't run out there ? ? ?  
You know my name and my game and what I'm here to do  
Party people, lemme see if you can dance to--

I'm double platinum, I'm watching you get dizzier  
Check out the way I say my, display my, play my  
Ain't holding back, behind the cool without the A.Y.  
I love to ride the groove because the groove is smooth  
It makes me move and I'll improve  
As it goes on, as it flows on  
When you see me, don't ask if the show's on  
How that sound? Don't came around, playing me close, brown  
Pull on my jock to be down  
You need to stay down, way down, because you're low down  
Do that dance, the prince of rap is gonna throw down  
Aiming to please while I'm killing emcees  
I'm gonna keep on hitting you with rough LPs  
Day after day after day  
Tou smashed in the face by the vase of Cool J  
I'm--[scratches]  
  
I'm a beast on the microphone, a night stalker  
A killing machine, a savage street talker  
Jason with an axe, but I put it on wax  
To eradicate the suckers who thought I had relaxed  
The prince of hip hop, straight from Queens  
Kicking it mean, keeping it clean  
And you've never seen anybody rock the party  
All you punks ? ? ? this beats Bacardi  
I go to the show, and terrorize emcees, don't you know  
Moving my hand like I'm playing the piano  
Don't touch the dial, don't change the channel  
Don't let me hear you say I ain't debonair  
I'm better than any emcee out there

I said something simple, and I knew that I'd fool him  
He's only mediocre, jealousy can't get with me  
Hang up your clothes, cause jealousy ain't spent to me  
He's just a monkey, riding my back  
In fact I kidnap, ram-sack, hijack and back slap the fool,

I play for keeps, the microphone's my tool  
I've been holding back long enough I had to bring it  
Jealousy is in the house y'all, fellas sing it

I'm not lackadaisical or lazy on the microphone  
I bring the bacon home so jealousy go home  
Or play the wall and pout about the way the prince is rolling  
So when they give it up, stand back and start folding  
All your jealous show clothes, I think you need to grab a  
half-pint of Cisco and hang out with Backstabber  
Cause I'ma break down all walls Jealousy built  
and then walk tall, like I'm standing on stilts yeah  
Jealousy the jam is mean you'll have to rewind it  
If you didn't know about him, you must have been blinded  
Ask him if I'm right, he'll tell you he sure is  
Excuse me for a moment, fellas sing a smooth chorus  
  
Jealous, jealous,  
Know what I'm saying? Smooth, word up  
Jealous, jealous,  
Huh, crazy gangster beat, you know what I'm saying?

Jealous, jealous,  
Word up, check it out  
Check it, yo  
  
Thank you fellas, the way you sung the chorus was swift  
but now it's time to pump lyrics, and shoot the gift  
His name is Jealousy fellas see what I mean now turn it out  
without a doubt and if it hits you in the heart don't pout  
Cause I'ma hit Jealousy and his posse where it hurts a lot  
Him and his boys have a habit, they always smirk a lot  
and make mean faces, I see em in many places  
Scared to face us, they wish they could erase us  
or outdo us, can't do damage and never will  
The Legend in Leather is clever, man I'ma never chill  
Allah take a break from this, yo I love swingin'  
Yo E, pop the bubbly, fellas, start singin'

Oh yeah, now I'ma wind it up  
It's time to move on and end the Jealousy cut  
and head off with a bang that sang and kicked your brain in  
I flowed like water now I'm finished explainin  
In the spotlight tonight his name was Jealousy  
And for some strange reason, it seems fellas be  
falling for him, I hope you understood  
Stay away from him he ain't no good

[Verse:]  
This is hard to say I wanna make sure I go about this in the right way  
'cause lately I been busy a lot  
And I know you don't feel appreciated and what not  
I used to tell you that you're hair looked fly  
Kiss you slow and stare in your eyes  
Now I talk real foul and slick  
Every other sentence is, ""You make me sick""  
Back in the days I was your number one pick  
Now your heart's hair-broken and that's hard to fix  
I had to dig deep inside myself  
'cause I can't see you bouncin' with somebody else  
It's a long journey back to the place we was  
When I was too embarrassed to admit I was in love  
And you was my good girl that wouldn't give it up  
I can't let us self-destruct  
  
[Hook: Marc Dorsey]  
Baby smile today  
'cause I been imaginin' more ways

When your friends'll see you too  
Just when you think there's nothin' else I can do  
I'm gon' love you better  
  
[Verse 2:]  
When I think about the things we did  
And I think about you having my kids  
And I think about us sharing a crib  
Losin' all that, God forbid  
You deserve flowers and candy, the simple things  
In addition to the sl's, baguettes and rings  
Instead I walk around like I'm a king  
And having you ain't nothing but a thing  
I even stopped tellin' you the lovin' was good  
Too busy frontin' in the hood Baby girl, hold me tight don't ever let go  
I'ma do it real gentle baby, nice and slow One more chance baby and don't say
no  
'cause I got another side to show  
Some say love is painful it helps you grow Well it's time for the pain to go,

[Verse 3:]  
It's a brand new me, a brand new you  
A brand new day, sky so blue  
Hold my hand while I walk with you  
Sit on my lap, lemme talk to you  
No more games callin' you foul names Actin' like females is all the same  
I'm gon' love you better, my mentality changed  
From this day forward I'll never be the same  
I'ma rub your lower back, share my dreams I love you, lemme show you what I
mean Give you the deepest love a girl ever seen Watch you sleep, so peaceful
and serene

"Don't call it a comeback  
I've been here for years  
I'm rocking my peers  
Puttin' suckers in fear  
Makin' the tears rain down like a monsoon  
Listen to the bass go boom  
Explosions, overpowerin'  
Over the competition I'm towerin'  
Wrecking shop when I write these lyrics  
That'll make you call the cops  
Don't you dare stare, you better move  
Don't ever compare  
Me to the rest that'll all get sliced and diced  
Competition's payin' the price  
  
I'm gonna knock you out  
Mama said knock you out  
I'm gonna knock you out  
Mama said knock you out  
I'm gonna knock you out  
Mama said knock you out  
I'm gonna knock you out

Don't you call this a regular jam  
I'm gonna rock this land  
I'm gonna take this itty-bitty world by storm  
And I'm just gettin' warm  
Just like Muhammed Ali  
They called him Cassius  
Watch me bash this beat like a skull  
That you know I've beef with  
Why do you riff with me  
The maniac psycho  
And when I pull out my jammy get ready  
Cause I might go Blaw!  
How you like me now?  
The Ripple will not allow  
You to get with Mr. Swift or Rift,  
Listen to my gears shift  
I'm blasting, I'm blasting  
Kinda like shaft, so you can say I'm shafting  
Olde English filled my mind, and I came up with a funky rhyme  
  
I'm gonna knock you out  
Mama said knock you out  
I'm gonna knock you out  
Mama said knock you out  
I'm gonna knock you out  
Mama said knock you out  
I'm gonna knock you out  
Mama said knock you out  
  
Shadow boxing when I heard you on the radio, UH  
I just don't know  
What made you forget that I was raw  
But now I gotta new tour  
I'm going insane  
Startin' the hurricane  
Releasin' pain  
Lettin' you know  
You can't gain or maintain  
Unless you say my name  
Rippin'  
Killin'  
Diggin' and drillin' a hole  
Pass the Old Gold  
  
I'm gonna knock you out  
Mama said knock you out  
I'm gonna knock you out  
Mama said knock you out  
I'm gonna knock you out  
Mama said knock you out  
I'm gonna knock you out

Shotgun blasts are heard  
When I rip and kill at will  
The man of the hour, tower of power  
I'll devour  
I'm gonna tie you up and let you understand  
That I'm not your average man  
When I gotta jammy in my hand  
Damn!  
Oh!  
Listen to the way I slay  
Your crew  
Damage  
Damage  
Destruction, terror, and mayhem  
Pass me a sissy so sucker I'll slay him  
Farmers (what)  
Farmers (what)  
I'm ready (we're ready)  
I think I'm gonna bomb a town  
Get down  
Don't you never, ever  
Pull my lever  
Cause I explode  
And my nine is easy to load  
I gotta thank God  
'Cause he gave me the strength to rock Hard  
  
I'm gonna knock you out

Verse One:  
  
Ll Cool J:  
Black shades, three-quarter leathers and medallions  
Honies lined up ready to ride like stallions  
Since good love is hard to find  
I snatch up the real hot ones and make 'em mine  
I let my track record speak instead of me  
On a level that the halfway players will never see  
Uhh, wave your drinks in the air  
Shorty turn around keep the ass right there  
Focus your attention-let your eyes  
Get paralyzed, by the size  
Of my rocks, just remember that members of my click carry glocks  
We got it locked down  
Mo' flowin', click rollin'  
Niggaz still smokin' [L get 'em open]  
Team rough scoop the cream with the puff  
You oughtta stop sleepin', you don't dream enough  
  
Mary J. Blige:  
Oooooh baby, not tonight, I don't wanna fuss and fight  
I just wanna make it right  
Oooooooh, there's work to do  
I wanna get real close to you, I wanna get you in the mood  
All the things, you want to do  
Just relax, and I'll take care of you  
And anytime you want me  
I'm sayin' that I love you everyday  
And I know that you want me, baby admit it  
  
Chorus: Gimme all your love and don't stop  
My love's waiting when you reach the top  
All night long  
Come into my bedroom honey  
What I got will make you spend money  
All night long  
  
Verse 2:  
  
Mary J. Blige:  
You know, that I know that you love me  
So if you just give me a change  
I can still show you romance  
I know, that you still savor for my flavor baby  
So stop playin' hard to get  
Let's make love like we first met  
All the things, you want to do  
Just relax, and I'll take care of you  
And anytime you want me  
I'm sayin' that I love you everyday  
And you know that you want me baby admit it

Verse 3:  
  
Ll Cool J:  
Girlfriend you get me open like Moet, cherry goes pop  
When my love drops  
Two G's in my pockets for tricks  
So tell your girlfriends to warm up and mingle with my click  
You're only a customer  
You're walking in the presence of hustlers  
I did it just right  
Spent money all night  
Magnums of Moet  
Get your lips wet

"Oh yeah  
Hey yo, man  
Ain't nothin' like a nice bowl of cornflakes in the morning  
To smooth you out  
  
Milky cereal  
(Baby)  
Milky cereal  
Milky cereal  
  
Mirror, mirror on the wall  
Who's the baddest female of them all?  
It was Frosted Flake, she loved to bowl  
And although her skin was white she had a lot of soul  
Rich female, very debonair  
Drivin' a Rolls with rollers in her hair  
We was hangin out, pumpin' the stereo  
She took me to a club, I think the name was Cheerio's  
She walked like she was jumpin' a hurdle  
I was happy as a kid that just saw Mutant Ninja Turtles  
A guy walked over, said, ""Your earring's cute.""  
I said, ""I'm wearin' a earring, but it ain't no Fruit Loop.""  
Me and Frosted went to get a drink  
But she ordered somethin' bugged, and I ain't know what to think  
She ordered potassium, calcium  
Carbohydrate scotch with sodium  
She took me to her crib, threw me on the couch  
I woke up the next morning with a spoon in my mouth  
She's

Milky cereal  
(Baby)  
Milky cereal  
Milky cereal  
Milky cereal  
Milky cereal  
  
I went to Vegas, didn't think it'd do any harm  
I walked into this girl named Lucky Charm  
For some reason, we walked in the rain  
She had a four-leaf clover with a big gold chain  
She had a salary that was full of calories, for real  
And I was in the mood for a home cooked meal  
So we went to be alone  
But we had to be quiet, 'cause her corn pops was home  
Kissed her neck, kissed her back, kissed her arms  
I said ""Forget it, let me see your lucky charms.""  
When we began, her hairstyle was neat  
But when I left the next morning it looked like shredded wheat  
Talked about marriage, I said ""That's risky  
Besides, it's such a waste of Rice Crispies""  
She had a robe with the velour material  
Her pops woke up, I said ""Hello Mr. Cereal  
I came this morning to deliver the paper.""  
He said ""Stop frontin', I know you caught the vapors  
That's my daughter, so save your croonin'  
You better find another bowl of cereal to stick your spoon in.""  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yeah, check this out here  
  
Then there was Pebbles, times was rough  
She was turnin' tricks to get her ""coo-coo puff!""  
Her mind was gone, but she turned me on, in fact  
She was wearin' an Apple Jack hat  
With a full-link fox and some pink bobby-socks  
Her father had a greedy disease, fried chicken pocks  
We called him Hungry Jack  
He talked like pops, and then he dressed like The Mack  
He invited me out to lunch  
With a old army buddy of his, Captain Crunch  
The waiter said, ""Jack, what would you like today?""  
He said ""I don't know, just make it Special, 'K?""  
He said ""Cool,"" came back with the order  
That's when I said, ""Hey yo, Jack, I like your daughter.""  
He said ""Pebbles? Boy, are your crazy?""  
I said ""Nah, I want to ride in a Mercedes  
She could sing while I'm swingin' my thing  
'Cause her burgers taste better than Burger King.""  
He said ""Go party, do some minglin'  
You and my daughter, your brain must be jinglin'""  
I said ""It's smooth, no disrespect  
She'll sign a pre-nup, so she don't get half of my week cheque.""  
Then we walked down the aisle  
Our honeymoon was milky cereal style  
  
You know what I'm sayin'?

Milky  
  
Peace!

"Yeah, yeah  
""Oh my God""

""They love success!""  
(Where you been?)  
Right here baby  
  
Look in the mirror while I tell you a tale  
About a mogul named Uncle L  
Sit on eight figures, man with a vision, move with precision  
(He excels, they all fail)  
Undisputed, the game got so polluted  
That he turned his 'Radio' off  
He 'Needed A Beat' so he could 'Jingle' them bells again  
Watchin' the plasma TV in the loft (with somethin' soft)  
With a leopard print outfit on  
Cause he known to flood any mic he spit on  
He's a (uh uh, 'Phenomenon')  
Ice glistenin', listenin' to 'break of dawn'  
He went from, 'Hollis to Hollywood' in fact  
Owned the Dow Jones and stacked the NASDAQ  
Conference call with his broker, 'What's the yield on that?'  
""Exotic Motorcars,"" we want a deal on that  
  
[Chorus]  
Mirror mirror (you go baby) speak to me (you flow baby)  
What's this image that I see before me (you know baby)  
It's a winner (you go baby) please believe it (you go baby)  
I can see it so I can achieve it (you flow baby, you go baby)  
  
'Around the way girls be doin' it well'  
They love the way that man look on the (XXL)  
On the Money magazine covers  
When he stop at the light, it's like his Benz hovers  
Smoke blowin' from the chrome exhaust, of his Boxer Porsche  
(Look at him, lickin' his lips when his joint pull off)  
Ever since 'Boomin' System', damn she missed him  
She, couldn't resist him, dreamt she kissed him  
In a, warm jacuzzi full of 'Milky Cereal'  
She said (I need love from the grand imperial)  
I been his biggest fan since five years old  
And now I'm twenty two, I love money (ooh)  
'Backseat of the Jeep', you need that  
(Who do you love?) Baby repeat that  
(Who do you love?) You need to keep back  
Milk and 'Pink Cookies' he known to eat that

Tryin' to get as much money as possible, no negative consequences  
Knahmsayin baby? I'm goin' long, feel me

'goin' Back to Cali', cop a crib on the mountain  
Strobe lights jumpin' off, birdies is bouncin'

Eliminated competition quickly  
Phantom of the Opera on the low where your clique be  
He feel his flow deep down in your artery  
Peep her man's checkbook (uh) that's where his heart'll be

Young players fall quicker from chicks and hard liquor (ahahah)  
But uh, he's 'Bad', he got 'The Power of God'  
In the Four Seasons, laughin' at the L'urmitage?  
He been there, mini-bars, RandB stars  
Young groupies in the lobby on the search for (Bobby)  
Young tycoon in the Steve Wynn suite  
Readin' e-mails with ten on repeat, I seen it

Yeah, on the butcher block slice her like a ox  
When it's time to get down, nigga I jam like a Glock  
I bust through all types of red tape and sue papes  
Niggas come old but they always wanna infiltrate  
I'm cuttin' snakes through the belly witta icepick  
And scoopin' hotties, a strong aisle of flip trips  
It's the rebirth of murkin' niggas once again  
I drain with ink and put your blood in my pen

A nigga got to live and Mr Smith is power god, kid

Ya better call a medic cos ya look pathetic  
Guan boy it's the champion Mr Smith  
Your niggas couldn't raise up with a forklift  
Cocked the hammer, peep out the grammar  
It's hard like Bacardi and hot like a house party  
All your so-called flavor niggas is deaded  
Your next step is where ya headed so don't forget it  
Your rhymes is beat, your steelo's scarred to scrape  
When you scream you sound muddy like a bled teeth  
I get'cha open like f-lay, 'tack you when I spray  
Lethal compositions around your way  
I'm the maniacal murderous Mr James Smith  
Rippin' ya ass out the frame with my verbal gift

"[Chorus:]  
Once I live a life of a millionaire  
Still do!  
Spending my money, honey ohh I didn't care  
Still don't!  
  
[Verse 1:]  
I'm a floss 'til I die, ball never fall  
Cop 'til I drop, Motherfuck 'em all  
Count paper schemin, leanin on the wall  
Money comin fast, niggas ridin balls  
I been to hell and back, I seen what you saw  
6 in the mornin, D's at the door  
I was a shorty on a bike, hangin with Alpo  
I was a shorty uptown with Rich Porter  
I was a shorty up on 1, 3, 2  
My man az he really schooled me  
My man Big Chuck, he took me to Mt. V  
I messed up the count, Kev winked at me  
What I learned is niggas need paper to burn  
And you gotta spread love when cats is fucked up  
You can't be lazy, for niggas that's bad fuck  
Sometimes you move quiet and lay upin the cut (whattup)  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[Verse 2:]  
I learned if you talk to much you get that ass shot up  
Follow your dreams, and watch the cash pile up  
I used to be in Queens with my man Black Just  
Before he got killed, now that nigga was real  
He took me to the crib, showed me how gangsters live  
Took me to hot blocks, showed me big knots  
Him and Richard Porter used to tease me and what not  
You ain't movin pies, so your car can be fly  
Used to run to Big Kev before he got knocked  
When niggas was stuntin and wouldn't let me on the block  
125th in the Beemer with az  
He gave a bum 50 dollars that really taught me  
That being a gangster don't mean you're all bad  
And niggas respect you when they know you got cash  
Remember Big dave had the dust on smash  
I was amazed the lifestyle was so fast  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[Verse 3:]  
I remember Remy showed my his first 8th ki'  
That was before Queens had blood in the street  
Stretch from bk had the pretty gold Benz  
He took me out to Brooklyn where he was gettin some ends  
Let me state this again, I ain't gotta pretend  
They was playing the money game and I wanted in  
I was just a young boy with dangerous friends  
If it wasn't for rap, who knows where I would've been  
I took a hustlas heart to make the top of the charts  
Big Chuck when to jail when I was ready to start  
I guess I was destin, God pulled us apart  
But I admit, getting that street money is a art  
I was so many players I knew back in the D  
Like Cuban Alberto from Mi-ami  
'86 that nigga's Benz had tv's  
Only God knows what these niggas mean to me  
Real talk

Leanin' dipped in rocks, pump the joint on the block  
Behind the Dolce Gabbana shades, peepin' the spots  
Frostbit and I'm turnin' blue, that's why I'm so hot  
Put the hustle down majorly and never get knocked  
  
Who can grind for this? Momma taught me to swerve  
Rent the presidential suite out, snatch ya bird  
My motto is dough or die, peace sign in the sky  
In the brand new 'lectric blue Bentley ridin' by  
  
Hurt these clowns, anybody that want it  
Let you borrow my crown, tell me why would you flaunt it?  
Don't you know you can get it, have your wig-piece splitted

Y'all need to do, when I come through, give it up  
Paper stackin', daddy get it crackin'  
Chains might be gold, the joints always platinum

Uh, we rockin to the rhythm (all night baby)  
Uncut raw, what we give 'em  
  
Hell yes, bounce to the music! (bounce)  
When the joint come on, everybody lose it

Ask me why I pop Cris', why not? (Why not?)

Got your Belve splashin' to the melody, what you tellin' me?

I made you, why would I play you?

Swinging a fast bitch, foul out, betray you  
When I won't even wanna hit it in a day or two  
Straight home I'd run, well, that's debatable  
I can't front, I hit a slump all players do  
But tough times are minor to a major dude  
We all lose sometimes, I call it paying dues  
Now you're searching all the clubs for what's available  
A year ago, my slot was unassailable  
My feast is a famine without you to cater to  
If these walls could talk, what would they say to you?

Don't understand what we gonna do  
But it's like you don't know me  
And I don't know you, no more  
Not no more!

No idea, but we're not what we were before  
Could it be that I don't love you and you don't love me no more?  
That girl don't live here not no more!  
Baby, baby,  
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, that girl no more!  
  
The dining room has an empty chair  
The mirrored staircase has an empty stair  
House full of company, but no one's here  
We singing cheers while we holding back tears  
To keep up appearances in front of our peers  
We play holiday card tricks every year  
Blackjack, poker, make the joker disappear  
The ace can't breathe when it's tension in the air  
Three clubs in one night, but nobody cares  
Cause it's still not a full house without a pair  
You tipped your hand, but the text wasn't clear  
You're dealing from the bottom queen of hearts, play fair!

Slip in the door, you hold my hopes so  
All I hear is love don't live here anymore  
We can tear the house down or build some scaffold  
We're sitting on a fence, so where you wanna go?  
You're the architect of your life, it's your show  
You create the blueprint and how the rooms flow  
Before you burn the house down, think, take it slow  
Even arsonists need a shelter, let me know

"One shot  
Oh lord  
You know, it's gonna be a lot of negative things surrounding you  
Trying to pull you down  
But what you have to remember is  
It's up to you, it's your choice  
You only get one shot in life  
And you only get one shot at love  
  
Did you ever notice, every time you fall in love  
And it seems like you finally met the perfect match  
Everything is perfect, it seems divine  
But for some strange reason, there's always a catch  
It's a one-way relationship, it hurts inside  
One person smirks while the other one cries  
Butterflies in the stomach of the one whose in love  
It cuts like a knife, the truth mixed with lies  
  
One shot (one shot at love)  
One shot at love, one shot (one shot at love)  
One shot at love, one shot (one shot at love)  
One shot at love, one shot (one shot at love)  
That's all you get  
  
Physical and mental, those are two different loves  
Physical's a moment, mental is forever  
If the physical fades and gets weak, all of a sudden  
Remember, it's the mental love that keeps you together  
You gotta be strong and endure the hard times  
Cause af-ter hard times, good times, always follow  
And when you're kissin' and huggin' and makin' love  
Treat that person like there's no tomorrow  
  
One shot (one shot at love)  
One shot at love, one shot (one shot at love)  
That's all you get baby, one shot at love, one shot (one shot at love)  
One shot at love, one, shot (one shot at love)  
That's all you get  
  
Jealousy, don't let it interfere  
Don't let it come in between  
The love you two share, cause jealousy's a hateful God  
So merciless and mean  
And it's only job in life, is to ruin relationships  
And pit two people against, one another  
And because of this God, the one you love so much  
Will no longer be your lover  
  
One shot (one shot at love)  
Aw baby, one shot at love, one shot (one shot at love)  
That's all we get, one shot at love, one shot (one shot at love)  
I mean this baby, one shot at love, one shot (one shot at love)  
That's all  
  
I hope you understand what I just said  
All I'm saying is that you only get one shot at love in life  
And you have to hold on to that shot, take advantage of it  
Cause when you lose it, it's gonna hurt real bad  
Take it from me  
You only get one shot, and I mean that  
One shot

You only get you only get you only get one  
You only get you only get you only get one  
One shot at love

No joke all this love, let it stay broke out  
Behind every playa is a true playette  
Bounce you up, outta there, push and check  
Taster's choice, have you nice and moist  
Or play paper games or floss the Rolls Royce  
  
[Chorus]  
Something like a phenomenon Something like a phenomenon  
Something like a phenomenon Something like a phenomenon  
Something like a phenomenon Something like a phenomenon  
Something like a phenomenon Something like a phenomenon  
(uh huh) (go ahead daddy)  
  
He was king of seduction, cop a suction  
Now she was the cat that worked construction  
Starve her with the paper, abuse the mind  
Dis a new lover, when you know it's on mine  
that's on top, lap dancin' got to stop  
You play out your chick cause your game is hot  
I give you two, Italian, ice my whole crew  
He's banging on my chest till it's black and blue  
You beefin', yellin' on the cell of my six  
You reach it then you hear the cordless click  
Now your club hopping, keep the Cristal poppin'  
Use my chips and take the next man shoppin'  
Hell no, must be out Chicago  
on your knees and your elbows each and every time  
That's why I love you mami, you  
Run your mouth though your legs over the bed baby  
Work me out  
  
[Chorus]  
  
He was all souped up, but played it just right  
Mami I was full blown, my game was air tight  
I needed to switch up and get it in gear  
It's a whole new movie, a world premiere, yeah yeah  
Keep it jinglin', no more minglin'  
A brand new year, me and you can bring it in  
I'm sick and tired of the freakin', night to morn'  
Moanin' in the mirror with my Cubans on  
Let bygones be bygones, no more games  
Hope all the chicken heads go up in flames  
Now we in the brand new mansion, with the lake in back  
Got it all figured out, mami I like that  
Collect tips, cop his and her whips  
The voice a quarter mil'-on, close the safe  
But you're worth it playgirl, it's real in the field  
Say what you want, but keep your lips sealed

Pink cookies in a plastic bag, getting crushed by buildings  
  
I'll take 30 electric chairs

Your whole body like plastic  
So why try to deny what ya already know ya love

Rub ya down with warm Ice-T  
Make ya feel Bran Nubian  
Instantly.  
Boogie Down  
And check this Production.  
Gimme them lips  
They look good for suction.  
She said, ""Sweet tease  
Cool with a little almond joy  
On the side  
Just doin' the fly""  
You like pound cake?  
Comin' to my house  
Turn on the lights  
And see me on the couch.  
I said, ""Do the jingle  
And your from around the way.  
I like your earrings  
L's  
But anyway,  
Your grand-daddy is  
Here to spread cheer.  
Something nice and smooth  
With my tongue in your ear.  
Give me a snack  
Some Salt And Pepper on a burger.  
Ice Cube T  
Or if you prefer the  
Taste of honey Kid  
Ride in my Capri and  
That's the joint  
They got the real clear CD in.  
She said, ""Stars couldn't get me in a car.

You might know karate  
Do me and get away

Feel it in mo and more,  
When I get ready for a showcase  
Put together well

Right in front of me.  
I know a kid named K  
He's a MD.  
Last time I heard

Burn the whole metropolis, lyrical warfare  
Hip-hop Apocalypse, strap devils to the chairs  
Start shockin' shit, Q you, I chew through  
We could battle in the projects and give or take the clue  
Flex could get one too, the wait, I'm supplyin'  
My crew pop, they iron from HTM to the peaks of Mount Zion  
I'm ready for the showdown  
Mention my name, cowboy, watch it go down

Your ass looks stupid, tryna fight it  
You wanna get your ass smacked up  
So you can dig into the stash that I stacked up  
But when my Queens, niggas flashed then you backed up  
Keep my dogs fed, so they can shit when niggas act up

You faggot to comp rapper on a quest  
You get your head flown, boy you must be smokin' sens  
So many often wonder if MDs paid  
You're goddamn right, punk, stay outta my way  
'Cause I clock Gs while you clock Zs  
And I don't smoke crack, I smoke M.C.s  
So pick up a pen, cop a squat, and take notes  
A rapper suffred from bleeding, sprains and slit throats  
My style deadly psychopath or schizophrenic  
Rapper choke like a curburetor, freeze up, and panic  
'Cause I clock pesos, don't sell ileyo  
Another name for cocaine, mi amigo  
That's Spanish terminology for friend  
Now sit back and rub my bozack as I send  
Bass funk with beats that thump  
Kickers and amps cold lined up in my trunk  
My system cranking, my headlights are blinkin'  
Brother ridin' my tip, L, at the same time thinkin'  
Damn, how could a brother be so nice  
'Cause I'm the capital E-P twice M-D-E twice  
I choose to squeeze, some choose to fight  
I like to write but then again some bite  
While you were bangin' on tables, I was bangin' Snow White  
  
Yeah slow down baby  
  
The ripper, the master, the overlordian  
Playing M.C.s like a old accordion  
I get the inspiration from a necessary station  
Them sayin' I was vacationin'  
You can't cope with your weak-ass throat  
Tryin' 'a sneak a peak in while I freak the notes  
Major M.C.s become minor B flats  
So retire the mike, get your chains and your bats  
Here's your chance to advance, gettin' your stance  
I'm 'a shoot the holster off your cowboy pants  
Pure entertainment, tonight's your arraignment  
You're quilty, face down on the pavement  
No holds barred, it's time to get scarred  
You and your squad better praise the real god  
The undertaker droppin' thunder on fakers  
When it comes to lyrics I'm as freaky as Seka  
So lay the mike down slow and careful  
'Cause mine is fully loaded and I have another handful  
A clip to slip in and start rippin'  
Divin' and dippin' and givin' punks a whippin'  
Just in case you wanna go a few rounds and so  
I'm down so that you clowns will know  
Me gettin' burnt or hurt won't be tolerated  
I got rhymes up the (huh) forget it, I'm constipated  
  
Yeah slow down baby  
  
When I come around homeboy, watch your nugget  
I master on the beat down, my style's rugged  
When I attack the microphone, close the zone  
Rap sees danger, can't roam  
Security is packed and wall to wall can't fall  
A rap tank is full so I can't stall  
My microphone is filled with premium  
Any whack M.C. that flexes, I'm creamin' 'em  
Not with lotion, bust the motion, flotation  
When I'm rockin' the mike I'm like coastin'  
Underneath fatigue at my peak  
You still seek the style 'cause yours is extra weak  
New method, rip the stage at my age and get loose and kick  
Like Bruce in a rage-I'm on a rampage  
  
Yeah slow down baby  
Slow down baby

Just starvin' like Marvin for a Cool J. song  
If you cried and thought I died, you definitely was wrong  
It took a thought, plus I brought Cut Creator along  
Evened up with E-Love down with the Cool J. force  
Symbolizin' in the rhymin' for the record of course  
I'm a tower full of power with rain and hail  
Cut Creator scratch the record with his fingernail  
Rock the bells  
  
The king of crowd rockers finally is back

The bass is kickin' always stickin' cause you like it that way  
You take a step because it's def and plus it's by Cool J.  
Cut Creator on the fader, my right-hand man  
We rock the bells so very well cause that's the name of this jam  
Rock the bells  
  
Some girl's will like this jam and some girls won't  
Cause I make a lot of money and your boyfriend don't  
L.L. went to hell, gonna rock the bells  
All you washed up rappers want to do this well  
Rock the bells  
  
Now I'm world-wide known, whether you like it or not  
My one man band is Cut Creator a.k.a. Philpot  
He'll never skip it, only rip it when he's on the fader  
What's my DJ's name, Cut Creator  
Now you know the episode who's on the wheels  
He'll drive the cross fader like a cut mobile  
So precise with a slice that you know he's greater  
What's my DJ's name, Cut Creator  
Now you know, what do you know, Earl roles the weed  
I go to the store and get Old Gold  
So all you crabby lookin' nappy headed girls get back  
Cause there's a ten to one chance that you might get smacked  
Rock the bells  
  
The bells are circulatin' the blood in your veins  
Why are girlies on the tip, L.L.'s your name  
Cut Creator's good, Cool J. is good-good  
You bring the wood pecker, I'll bring the wood  
The bells are wippin' and rippin' at your body and soul  
Why do you like Cool J., we like rock and roll  
Cause it ain't the glory days with Bruce Springsteen  
I'm not a virgin so I know I'll make Madonna scream  
You hated Michael and Prince all the way, ever sense  
If their beats were made of meat, then they would have to be mince  
Rock the bells  
  
So listen to the lines of rhyme, I rhyme on time  
He'll cut the record in a second, make your DJ look blind  
So all you jerry-curl suckers wearin' high-heel boots  
Like ballerinas, what I mean is you're a fruit-loop troop  
All you gonna-be(s), want to-be(s), when will you learn  
Want to be like Cool J., you gotta wait your turn  
Some suckers don't like me, but I'm not concerned  
Six-g (s) for twenty minutes is the pay I earn  
I'm growin' and glowin' like a forest blaze  
Do you like Michael Jackson, we like Cool J.  
That's right, I'm on the mic with the help of the bells  
There's no delayin' what I'm sayin' as I'm rockin' you well

Slow down, let me do my thing now, hold up

Until that day, health and welfare, cheers  
And after my wake, the hood'll talk, man listen here  
He kept a mink and canaries in his ears  
Like the Enterprise rollin' over stars for years  
Spit bars for years, kept hot cars for years  
The dice was loaded but he beat the odds for years, uh-huh!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
To be or not to be the man, that's the question  
Got a vision in my mind, I can see that I'm destined  
To lean up in the backseat, givin' directions  
Sweep the block clean as November elections  
On the Blackberry readin' cash flow quadrant  
Brim to the side, my gorillas is bonded  
CLS Vision, four Humers behind it  
You forgot I'm from Queens? You can get reminded  
I'm a man's man, when you chumps gon' learn  
If you play with fire you get poured in a urn  
You must have been puffin on blunts of sherm  
All my albums is platinum, it's been confirmed  
I'm more than a symbol of sex, I get respect  
For livin' in the hills but still keepin' it mad real  
Stay on course, the boss crush obstacles  
You burnin' me, two words: I'm-possible  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Like I said  
Yellow canary tennis on the neck  
Three quarter black mink  
Gucci hat to the side, shades  
Gucci shoes, baggy jeans  
Black Phantom, oak wood  
That's how I play  
Yeah  
(Shake it baby shake it)  
You do it for the gangsters  
I do it for the ladies, but it's all money baby

"I can shut a nigga down so quick my sounds so sick  
My talents spread around while I'm holdin' my dick

Rip a nigga from the East to the West

Niggas ain't even comin' close to my low score  
Niggas fleein when I'm rippin' on the hard core beat  
That's slammin' through your jeep like a 44 Mack to your back  
Nigga L never got rip by a track  
I don't fuck around, always come back  
For the lyrical miracle day one platinum plaque right off the back  
Looked at every nigga wit the mic on my arm  
A time-bomb blowin' up ring the alarm  
Cool double O flow well to the LL  
I'm leave the world looking hard as hell

Relentless endless friendless when it comes to the lyrical mack

Hear you fassen place on the blood of my veins without passion  
Mashin' take a little time to think the rhyme out  
How to find out  
Bump and grind out  
Pump the lines out

See to the double O bounce in the bubble eye limo

Kidnapped rap for a handsome ransom  
Smoke a little Branson on the side of the mansion  
Keep it thugged out even when a nigga dancing  
Branson make that trans and keep it dancing  
I'ma murder every nigga in the game  
Can't stand the rain  
Fuck a maintain  
Gotta leave the world in flames

Sideways stimulator bringin' the flames  
Niggas want to feel me spit the whole clips

Put me on the flier and I'm guaranteed to rope in  
Twenty-thousand people to the place that I play at  
And have em even saying how could someone say that  
They're as good as the man who just saw  
Please give me some more  
Of those hooping, scooping, rhymes you be trooping  
If you don't know the new dance, Patti Duke'n  
Clap your hands, stomp your feet, snap your fingers  
I'm snatching airplay, from all you AIDS catching singers  
It's a, special delivery on your front step  
My picture's on the cover and the rhymes are in effect  
Cause, I love to lay down, joints for the playground  
And have you OD'n saying, y'know, J sound  
Righteous, the brother did what he had to  
I didn't talk about this, so I had you  
Sleeping, breathing saying yo he ain't keeping  
His promise to astonish, from weekend to weekend

I'm the wise wizard of the microphone swinging it  
Here's a mean joint, all the hip-hoppers are singing it  
Doing a dance in tight bike pants  
So get up on it (hoe!) you'll only get one chance  
To work out, the soreness in your muscles  
Do your own thing, even the hustle  
MC's I'ma torture, that's already known  
But while I'm torturing them, I'ma leave you alone  
So you can bump, grind, and rub up against your partner  
And look wild like you're tryin to get a part in a  
Dirty movie on the hip-hop tip  
Now tell me (tell you what?) that brother L ain't tryin to flip  
With the

Moving, grooving, admit that you've been  
Shocked and rocked and I'm on top and it's been proven  
I'm self-reliant, on stage I'm defiant  
All those rumors are small things to a giant  
I'm not a cool calm, collected type of brother  
I'm kind of hype that's why I'm a good lover  
In bed I'm energetic, kind of like a freight train  
Going so crazy I have the girlies saying, ""Wait James!""  
I do damage, use the beef to build a sandwich  
And when I'm done, she'll be saying, ""How did you manage  
To make me feel pleasure from my toes to my head?  
On top of that, you ran laps around the bed""  
So bust out the pumped up funk that I'm revealing  
And listen to it, while you're in your car wheeling  
On on your Walkman as you're staring at the ceiling  
Or when you and your love is sex-appealing  
To the

So why can't I turn off the radio?  
  
Gotta fix that calendar I have that's marked July 15th  
Because since there's no more you, there's no more anniversary

No sell-out, the chip is too rough and  
I'll blow your skin to sofa, leave your mind to be tough  
And I might seem rough but life is much rougher

But will you be around when the raindrops fallin'  
Or could it be you never loved me at all and  
I need a trooper, a soldier, a agent  
I need someone who can roll with my arrangement

Standin' by her man till the end  
Not only as a lover but a friend

You held back when your loved jobs called in  
You had faith when they said they're not callin'  
You understood that what we had was good  
You stood by your man like a real queen should

A beautiful wisdom, a part of my team and

You know it's funky, funky, funky cos you heard it from hear-say  
A jam that you love that don't be gettin' no airplay  
Strictly for frontin' when you're ridin' around  
12 o'clock at night with your windows down  
Headlights breakin' 'cause your batteries drain  
Armor all on your tires and a big gold chain  
Parkin' outside of all the hip-hop spots  
Push the E-Q and play connect the dots  
Leanin' to the side, people everywhere  
The trunk full of amps, there ain't no room for a spare  
Big beats bumpin' with the bass in back  
All the sophisticated suckers catch a heart attack  
Cause they don't understand why I act this way  
Pumpin' up the funky beat until the break of day  
It's because I want attention when I'm ridin' by  
And the girls be on my jock cos my system's fly  
  
Girlies wanna ride with a brother like me  
Cause they be hear me gettin' funky frequently  
They tell me don't drink and drive, I say what is this  
Mind your business  
Now pass it around  
Laid back, hypnotized by the funky sound  
People in the street see me bobbin my head  
While I'm checking out the rapper and the rhyme that he said  
I'm fronting, and I don't care if you know  
The backseat of my car is like a disco show  
You would think I was a good friend of Al Capone  
Crazy air freshener, who needs cologne  
Bottom to the bottom to the top to the top  
Cruise, it's 3 o'clock  
The girlies, they smile, they see me coming  
I'm steady huming, I got the Funky Drumer druming  
My trunk be shaking, vibrating and rattling  
Pumping so loud, all the shorties be battling  
A right-hand man's here without the swing  
Every chance I get I'm showing off my rings  
I can keep it up until the break of dawn  
Cos I'm fronting in my ride and my word is bond  
  
Sun roof open, so I can feel the wind blow  
I don't give a damn if it cracks my back window  
C to the o to the o to the l to the i to the n  
To the f to the r to the o to the 'n' to the t to the i to the n  
That means I'm chilling  
Like Spoonie Gee said, my seats are soft like a bed  
They recline way back, so I can get real cosy  
I got the gangster tapes in the place  
Like a base-head would say I want bass  
I want a hit, I want a dose  
You're rolling up smiling, but you can't come close  
Cos my system is pumping loud  
Like Rakim said I wanna move the crowd  
I warm it up with Kane, fight the power with PE  
Tell the cops you gots to chill with EPMD  
This is something devastating that'll break your trunk  
And remember, Uncle L is like the future of the funk  
  
You know what I'm saying  
Word  
So next time you're in your ride pumping it up  
Just remember  
It's Cool

"Knuckleheads spreadin' gossip all over town  
Every time I drive by you're just standin' around  
Hundred-bottles in your pocket, forty-dog in your hand  
Don't you know you're just a worker and your boss is my man?  
L.L. this, L.L. that, soon as I walk in the place  
I want to take my gun and shoot you in your muthafuckin' face  
You're playin' me too close with the schemin' and games  
I guess the beef and the bullshit is the price of fame  
Movies, records, goin' on tour  
Twenty-thousand people hip-hoppin' on the floor  
Whole parties body-rockin', and everything's chill  
Get back to New York, and the suckers act ill  
See I fought with the devil, made a promise to God  
I have experience in goin' all the way to the top  
It's harder harder than hard  
All the suckers are barred  
You used to try to talk down now your ego is scarred  
See the problem is you want what another man has  
His car, his wife, or his razzamatazz  
But that's weak, you gotta do work on your own  
Cause when you're rich you got friends  
But when you're poor you're alone  
So get your own on your own, it'll strengthen your soul  
Stop livin' off your parents like you're three years old  
Instead of walkin' like you're limp and talkin' yang about me  
Why don't you take your monkey-ass and get a college degree?  
Or write a rhyme and ride a bike and try to live carefree  
Hope my message reaches you before you're seventy-three  
A old man, when people ask you what you did with your life  
You'll say ""I hated L.L. and I carried a big knife""  
Every day is a chase, every day is a race  
And every day you're being overpowered by my bass  
Too much juice to be a deuce, I had to be a ace  
It's like the fire's in my eyes and the gun's in my face  
I'm stompin' stupid knuckleheads until they bleed  
I'm the leader of the show, so it's up to me to lead  
I'ma lead you away from drugs and petty crime  
Lead you away from wack beats and rhyme  
Lead you to that ticket line  
So you can come in my show and watch the stars shine  
Get busy, not dizzy, want to teach the young  
The last man who didn't listen ended up gettin' hung  
Not that I killed him, it's just  
He didn't want to trust  
The words of a master that's why you must  
Take heed to the speech, it's gonna reach your ear  
Don't try to say you can't hear 'cause the words are clear  
Throwin' flurries, punks scurry and I bury the rest  
You better hurry up and rock a rhyme and give it your best  
Cause tonight's the night we gonna see the big fight  
Twelve-gauge on the stage in case it don't go right  
E-Love drives a tank, he's strong like a truck  
If you're cryin' while you're dyin' we ain't givin' a fuck  
L.L. Cool J is on the microphone  
Tellin' all you punk ducks ""Leave me the hell alone""  
Cause I'm rated X, born to snap necks  
Straight up and down, no special effects  
I'm the professor, the teacher, the hip-hop dean  
If Russia bombed the U.S., they'd be scared to touch Queens  
Cause that's where I live, and this is what I give  
Turnin' top-notch crews into fugitives  
They run, they frightened, they hide from King Titan  
Like a sniper when he's shootin' or a viper when he's bitin'  
Here I am, tellin' the truth  
And I'm spreadin' the word to my fellow youth  
It goes man-to-man and jam-to-jam  
I got hip-hop, rock, and love song fans  
All you petty MC's in the state of New York  
Gettin' a thousand for a show but you still want to squawk  
Can't get a decent contract, your beats ain't workin'  
Dogged-out Pumas plus you're manager's jerkin'  
Your mic sounds weak, remember that sieezer  
I'm badder than Napoleon, Hitler or Caesar  
I'm a hit man, but I'm not for hire  
Fly girl's desire, the man you admire  
Not only on the stage, I rock in the park  
And I'm a killer in the daytime, and worse after dark  
So don't never ever mess with the king of the sound

Lemme run it throughout this album, tell Speilberg ""Chill""  
My jet hit LaGuardia six in the morn  
They be waitin' in the Bentley when the plane takes on  
Straight to the studio dirty, no shower  
Threw out 5 mics in the first half hour  
Niggas know, who about to get all the dough (LL)  
Who about to hit all your homes (LL)  
Who about to spit all the flows  
That's all I can say, and I can't stands no more (We know)  
Alright then, what the fuck the deal yo?  
I's raised on some ill shit, let's be real  
Uptown, the Bronx, and Brooklyn and Queens  
Staten Island, Jersey, ya know the routine  
  
[Chorus]  
  
East Coast, y'all want it, y'all got it  
Look up in my eyes, a nigga feeling psychotic  
Look outside nigga, my cars excited  
Look at the crowd, how they respond to my product  
Like ecstasy, my crew's next to me  
It's my destiny, to make history  
I'm the emperor, Rap King  
From the streets of Paris, up north to Sing-Sing  
One question: Do I do my thing thing? (Hell Yeah)  
Then putcha L's in the air, for the Greatest Rapper All Time  
You want that other nigga album  
But that nigga bought all mine  
So get the realness  
Matter fact turn it up so you can feel this  
Ice grill all you want, I'm fearless  
Nigga, you just blue try, you can't appeal this  
I'm about to kill this  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(LL Cool J is) Break it down  
(Hard as)  
  
Feel it, yeah, blow ya whistles, yeah  
Sss, you can't fuck wit me, nigga  
Feel it  
Fuck wrong wit you?  
  
I wrote so ill that I sold ten mill  
Drop more platinum, to fo' mo' bills  
You pop mo' shit, I show mo' skill  
Greatest of All Time, and that's all real  
Ain't no reappear could do what I do  
Rip ya whole label solo, no crew  
Ain't a MC that I can't go thought  
And I only have respect for a chosen few  
But they could get it too  
Trust me, you don't want L to spit at you  
I'm the one they call when shit gets critical  
The way I conquer the world is spiritual  
I'm imperial  
Everlasting, the best who ever did it  
Holding the crown down, can't nobody get it  
Germany, Italy, France, Japan  
London, Africa, bow to The Master, The G.O.A.T.

"
"Something real smooth  
Yeah, yeah  
Yeah  
We'll get into the groove  
Power of God move  
Something real smooth  
Something you need to take heed to  
  
A base-head cleaned up his act  
He stopped smoking crack and took his soul back  
Decided, he could find a much better way to live  
You know the way, positive  
Without all the negative chemicals and drugs  
Without all the hanging with the envious thugs  
Never before was a man so far behind  
And came back to rule for a long time  
Positive will explode when you light me  
My enemies lurked, and they held the dagger tightly  
Wanted to taste my blood, but they got scarred  
When they felt the power of God  
  
Wickedness got crushed when the Lord came  
Down with the King, cause he's evil and vain  
He doesn't understand the power of a ?  
Doesn't realize I'm rolling with a team  
Avenging angels will come and burn  
All those who saw, but refused to learn  
He has no color, no shape, and no form  
And like I told you before, I'm just getting warm  
Get up, get down, get on it, it ain't that hard  
You can feel the power of God  
  
Money is small and the soul stands tall  
All those who don't realize this, fall  
The mind of a drunken fool is a useless tool  
And it's cool to be in school  
And overcome and overpower, but still uplift  
Your mind is a gift  
You're somebody, whether you know it or not  
Outside the weather is hot  
People walk around with their minds in a daze  
Never take the time to stop and give praise  
You're lucky to live in this world  
Even the starving boys and girls  
Cause life is a gift in itself  
And only certain people are blessed with good health  
I'm Uncle L, but you can call me Todd  
I can feel the power of God  
  
You know I'm sayin  
And G is the seventh letter made  
Yeah  
G is the seventh letter made  
  
The power of God  
Yeah  
The babies, we gotta teach em, and hold em  
Send em to school, so we can teach em, and mold em  
Shape em, and make em take form  
Cause their mind is like a ball of clay when it's wet and warm  
Harmless and innocent  
Until they're taught to be violent, and militant  
This mentality gotta be erased by faith  
The 12th hour is coming, we're close to the 8th  
Get a chapter, and gain some knowledge  
If not from the Bible or Koran, get a book from college  
It's not about being black or white  
It's about everybody being a right  
I pulled out my mic, and the devil got hit hard  
He felt the power of God  
  
And G is the seventh letter made  
Power of god  
G is the seventh letter made  
  
That was just a word to the wise  
Up rise  
Cause we definitely gotta unify  
And we need unity in times like these  
We got to stick together  
Cause we as a people  
All people  
Gotta make it to the promised land  
Peace

Don't ever underestimate the Jack the Ripper  
Be clear, every time he reappears, it's sicker  
Listen here, the mind expanded, the vision is slicker  
I'm long range like a miss-ile, many styles to getcha  
Tear ya out the frame so the hood can get the picture  
But I'd rather break bread, kick knowledge and get some money witcha  
I'm willing and able, to smooth pounds out like Witch Hazel  
The legend is real, I'm not a fable  
Captivated the screen, I'm Queens' Clark Gable  
If it ain't a joint, bet your label, don't put it on the table  
I'm out for the moolah, throw better hooks than David Tua  
Who's the nicest? (L, you are!)

You don't want it with L, b'ship cats'll get banged out  
Put your flow throw a filter boy, shake the old slang out  
23's in the building, watch my tongue hang out  
Makin' MC's scatter like multiple shots rang out  
Day one since I came out, they can't put the flame out  
My temp seizing, perfect reason to blow the game out  
Skating off in the Navi, naw baby you can't have me  
But I know cats will pay for that 'n lace ya, yeah, gladly  
Warning, young rappers, you don't want a career?  
Y'all want to keep going platinum, y'all don't want to disappear?

Cause you starting to get on my nerves, and that's a problem  
The vet's in here

Tension on the mic, halftime highlights  
L Boogie banging on 'em, jumpin' through the skylight  
You stand corrected, I'm hot, so get it riddight  
I'm just spitting, when the middick is gripped, I spit it tiddight  
Alright? Oh, these various rappers is so hilarious  
Who put the mic down but y'all ain't qualified to carry this  
Your, tracks are garbage and bars are miscellaneous  
So, throwing your joint at my car was spontaneous  
Oh! I can't take it, why, must they fake it  
Flows is fully dressed, yours is butt naked  
Forever I will be, the one they came to see  
Blowing mics in half baby, who else could it be but

By age 19 Tyheim is turned out  
He ain't talking much, keep a dutch in his mouth  
Cop the aberrettes  
Orange and Blue  
Laced the Gore-tex, stepped with his crew  
Black superstar, Jesus piece  
Who he prayin' to? God or the Beast  
Some bust blocks, feared on the block  
Traded in the trucks for a silver drop top  
Drug money flowin'  
Jealousy is growin'  
Paranoia got him second guessin'  
D-T's on his back got him stressin'  
He was at the light blazin' up traum  
Around the corner came a tinted out Yukon  
Ten slugs in the door made him fall  
Guess he should of never hustled at all

My man Tay-Kwan like the chicks a lot  
Even when he hustled he kept them in his spot  
He liked to fuck a lot and make the rubber pop  
5 baby mothers  
1 live on my block  
Shinin' in the club  
Chickens showin' love  
Cash bubblin' from pimpin' and drugs  
He a real pretty cat  
He get from his moms  
Back in the seventies, she was the bomb  
His games top notch, and he don't stop  
He hit a reverends daughter in a church parkin' lot  
Tay-Kwan is sick, heartless with chicks  
He liked to beat 'em up, make 'em suck dick  
Met a little shorty, brought her back to Queens  
Honey got the virus, you know the routine  
Not only did he walk away with the HIV  
Her man's jealous, jooked him rediculously

Yolanda's always got a scream  
Credit cards in ATM machines  
Used to make coats, holdin' work got arrest  
Honey made sons pockets bleed to death  
She a vet, yet she look innocent and sweet  
When she wet, ain't no controllin' the heat  
For baguettes she give love to ill thugs  
Age of 15 she learned to pump drugs  
Then she got pregnant, abandoned the kid  
Met this drug kid, set him up and slid  
Now she 23 full blown in the mix  
Sizin' up wits than more cliques is gettin' chips  
She down for whatever, as long as it pays  
She tipped off the kids and got Tyheim blazed  
She was in the same Yukon, laughin' with the thug  
He said thanks for settin' Tyheim up  
Take a slug

Reincarnation of a slave pickin' cotton

I wanna kill 'em, I'd rather God hit 'em  
They sellin' venom and we buyin' it like denim  
These world wide webs they weave, we caught in 'em  
Old folks is dyin' and CEO's skimmin'  
The bat's in your hand and this is the 9th inning  
Keep your eyes on the ball when you swingin'  
Don't be confused, don't be fooled by the wind-up  
Start switchin' your position, make your mind up  
Pull your bootstraps tight, get your grind up  
Get your life lined up before time's up  
Yo, yo, you know what?  
Take ten percent of that, dough you tryin' to stack  
Send it up to God, I guarantee he send it back  
Multiply it by a hundred times, y'all remember that  
That's just a little jewel to get the monkey off your back  
Uh, yeah, sing it out now

In the darkest valley, through the loneliest alley  
Never give up, press on through the storm

And it goes, on and on and on and on and on and-ah  
I know it feels like your back's to the wall  
Who's sittin' in the crib, and you don't know who to call

But you ain't by yourself dog, we all been lost  
Stay on your course, carry your cross  
Ain't no stoppin', got to keep it poppin'  
You want it, you can get it, believe me the king did it  
Nothin' gonna hold you back, there's no limits  
I'm sent to bring truth to rap, not gimmicks  
And I'm not finished, man listen  
Here's the moral to the thesis, y'all cats need Jesus  
He put your life back together, pick up the pieces

For less fake rappers, and more real pastors

Think ya rockin' it on the floor,  
You look like a moron!  
Who let you in the door?  
To put the question bluntly  
Maybe your feet's deformed.  
They should slap you in the teeth  
When you put your dancing shoes on.  
You can't dance!  
  
Why don't you just nail your feet to the floor?  
Homeboy, what's the use?  
Anytime you wanna step aside a party,  
First think of an excuse.  
You dance like a fat old lady  
Not sayin' that fat old ladies ain't nice,  
But every time you try to get one move right.  
The old lady then did it twice.  
You can't dance!  
  
You've been a dancing disco disaster,  
The worst I ever saw.  
They should dropkick you on the neck  
And drag you off the floor.  
In every discotheque, I see you there  
In the middle of the crowd,  
Looking like you got eight or nine  
Left feet dragging all around.  
You can't dance!  
  
Take my advice, don't move!  
You'll never get the knack.  
If I danced like you I'd sneak out the party  
And wouldn't be coming back.  
On the floor you're a dinosaur,  
Yeah boy, that's how you move.  
You look like Ralph Cramden or a Donald Duck cartoon.  
You can't dance!  
  
You wanna come to my party?  
I wouldn't give you a chance.  
You tried to take break-dance lessons,  
Ended up in an ambulance.  
Wouldn't it be funny if they put you on solid gold?  
You dance like you got arthritis already,  
What'll happen when you get old?  
You can't dance!  
  
Why are you so stiff?  
Is it something that your mother did?  
Maybe you grew up around ""can't dance"" people  
When you were a ""can't dance"" kid.  
You live in a ""can't dance"" house,  
Went out in a ""can't dance"" car,  
Your doofy ""can't dance"" father  
Got drunk in a ""can't dance"" bar.  
You take a ""can't dance"" bath,  
Put on your ""can't dance"" cologne.  
Go out to a ""can't dance"" party  
So you wouldn't have to ""can't dance"" all alone.  
You can't dance!

Degrade egg your Al and Ol couldn't write this good  
But I'm the Warlord of rap with my own army

"Do you remember, the first time you fell in love  
The way it felt, the way it feels  
Being able to say, from the bottom of your heart  
I love you for real  
Your eyes, meet, you feel your heartbeat  
Palms are sweaty you can't keep still  
And when you finally touch 'em, and hug 'em and kiss 'em  
Oh what a thrill!  
You was always searching, and finally your dream came true  
They came strolling along  
And you promised 'em, straight up and down sweetheart  
I swear, I'll never do you wrong  
Hand in hand, heart to heart  
Nothing in the world could separate the two  
And even though you've only known that person for a short time  
You tell 'em I love you, you're my heart  
  
You argue witcha parents, and they argue BACK  
You're too young to be so serious  
You tell 'em that's not true, I'll go on without you  
And walk away aggravated and furious  
You want 'em to approve, but then again it don't matter  
The relationship's yours  
You feel you're maturing, and hey,  
You can fight your own battles and wars  
You discuss it with your love and it's the same for them  
So the two of you decide we're gonna weather the storm  
Life is sweet, kissing caressing and hugging  
And keeping each other warm  
But now comes the serious part, 'cause love  
Believe me, it ain't a easy task  
We'd have one argument too many  
And you'd have to ask, am I still your heart?  
  
Am I still your heart or is something, pulling us apart  
Cause baby if it is, please let me know what  
You run out the door, I tell you come back  
I love you, you shout out, so what?  
How could you hurt me? How could you treat me  
Like you never loved me, were you playing a game?  
And if so, I only have one request: sit down and explain  
To me, the person who treated you right, did you right  
And held you tight, every night  
Is there another lover in your life, that has you uptight?  
Cause if it is, aw, baby, please, don't do this to me  
I'm trying to reach you, trying to talk to you  
It's killing me, 'cause you're my heart  
That's right I admit it  
  
You're my heart I refuse, to let you go  
I struggle and fight for you against all odds  
Get down on my knees, and pray to God  
That our love is in the cards  
Cause I know you're right for me  
And I know I'm right for you  
There's no way in the world I'll let you slip out of my hands  
People say forget about it, move on  
But see they don't understand  
You're nothing to them, but you're so much to me  
So much in fact that I'd give my life  
To stare into your eyes and caress your face  
As the priest, announces us man and wife  
We'd live happily, ever after  
White picket fence and the whole nine yards  
And anything that anybody said  
I'd disregard, if I was still your heart  
  
So make up your mind, 'cause I've made up my mind  
I'm begging you baby please come back home  
I'll be tossing and turning, as I lay in my bed  
Sorrow surrounds me I can feel it in my bones  
This can't be true, I'm losing you  
Oh Lord have mercy, please make it alright  
All I wanna do in this whole wide world, is hold you tight  
I've ripped open my heart, shed tears and cried  
Now it's up to you baby, please understand  
I forgive you for everything, and give you anything  
Just let me take ya by the hand  
And lead ya, baby I got ya  
Protect you like a mother, protects a child  
Now it's up to you, I'ma call you in a little while  
You're my heart

"See what the world's done? Came to london

Trapped in the night, trafficked and beaten  
All a part of an evil economy  
Nothing more than someone's commodity  
A precious being like you and me  
A daughter, a sister, a somebody!

She worked right through the daylight  
No voice, she's a slave to the night

After the man left, she's nothing left  
No one, no love, no one to call her friend  
She's stuck in the pit of hell  
She's almost sick from the smell  
She's numb, she's dead from the inside out  
Her heart is screaming but you don't hear the shout  
Who's the voice? Who's gonna break the door down?  
Who wakes her up from the nightmare now?

27 million, are you joking?  
How did we let evil get so tight a grip  
Watching while the world falls apart?  
How did we let this stuff begin?  
We're not bothered if this offends  
Cause you got people that can depend  
But they ain't got that, they got nothing  
Sometimes you gotta stand for something  
Let this be the stand against your blood running  
  
Little girl don't cry  
Let me dry your eyes in the darkest night

Hold on through the storm  
You're not on your own

I'm goin' fo' mine, one mo' time  
I'm gettin' my goals accomplished while the others sit back and wind  
And none of y'all can fade me so don't even try  
'Cause I'm the best at what I do and I'm a tell you why  
So you see I'm too legit too ever quit  
I started gaining momentum when they put me in the mix  
You'll feel my power, the stage I'll burn it up  
So put it on the hammer, then people will burn it up  
To the records who tried to diss this is on yo face  
I'll turn this mutha out leave you lookin' disgraced  
Bet you can't touch and now you regret fo' calling  
Yourself a pet instead of something wet  
Now brothers went long, it's still the same song  
While people rollin' on, your crew is gone  
You know I got it started with a kickin' gold rhyme  
Suck as betta' pray 'cause it's hammer time one mo' time  
One mo' time, hey, I gotta get my, get my one mo' time  
One mo' time, hey, I gotta get my, get my one mo' time  
One mo' time, hey, I gotta get my, get my one mo' time  
One mo' time, hey, I gotta get my, get my one mo' time  
Check I peepin' over there if the fellows give me ten minutes  
I'll bet you I'll be in em' 'cause growin' on the high street  
Taught me how to get em', I grew on em'  
So tight I'm known to hight em' and quit em'  
See I step to her, she's mine in a matter of minutes  
It ain't how long you talk it's what you put in em'  
Spittin' this game so cold and you tellin' me  
That I'm not able to pick up this freak, well, you fail to see  
The hard nigga is what they call me  
And every year I'm at the player's balgee  
Whenever I'm next you can prepare to see a show  
And whenever it comes to breakin' it up  
You know I'm lettin' em' win the net  
And I'm the man in command, so I'm puttin' em' in their place  
And if she's lookin' for handouts then get outta' Hammer's Face  
I'm not the type to wine and dine but I'm freak to blow your mind  
So I guess I'm goin' fo' mine, one mo' time  
One mo' time, hey, I gotta get my, get my one mo' time  
One mo' time, hey, I gotta get my, get my one mo' time  
One mo' time, hey, I gotta get my, get my one mo' time  
One mo' time, hey, I gotta get my, get my one mo' time  
Hold now, take me to the bay  
I'm gainin' momentum from the 90's to the bay  
And everywhere I went, I made the people say  
Hey, I'm makin' em' all amazed in every phase  
And rap fools I gotta serve em' but this time  
The Hammer gotta hurt em'  
State to state after partyin' in Casinos  
Doin' and tryin' that, lougin' in Reno  
I got it started in Bang cock and rocked Barbados  
And watched Holy field know em' out in Vegas city  
After city I left the people in shock, you betta have believed  
I left the whole place rock and I love the way that the money  
Just rolls out, fifteen hundred cities every one of em' sold out  
Private jets, good times and bad times, suckas be tryin' to diss  
So I'm comin' with mad rhymes  
All of these things often come to mind  
But guess what y'all? Here comes the payback to her  
I'm doin' it one mo' time  
One mo' time, hey, I gotta get my, get my one mo' time  
One mo' time, hey, I gotta get my, get my one mo' time  
One mo' time, hey, I gotta get my, get my one mo' time  
One mo' time, hey, I gotta get my, get my one mo' time  
One mo' time, hey, I gotta get my, get my one mo' time  
One mo' time, hey, I gotta get my, get my one mo' time

This is serious, so give me a quarter

But before she knew it, she fell in a trap and got caught  
Yeah, she was all alone  
With no friends and no phone  
Now, this was beyond her worst dreams  
'Cause she was concerned by some wayward teens  
Headed by shredder, they were anything but good  
Misguided, unloved, they called them, the foot  
They could terrorize and be angry youth, and  
They mugged the people who needed proof?

Transformed from the norm by the nuclear goop

These ninjas are into pepperoni and cheese  
Back to the story, it's not hard to find  
Ninjas not just of the body but of the mind  
These are the words that their master instructed  
But a letter from shredder has splinter abducted  
That was the last straw, spring into action  
Step on the foot, now they're gonna lose traction  
Now this is for real, so you fight for justice  
Your shell is hard, so you shout, ""They can't dust us"", four  
Like some old coffee table  
Since you were young, you've been willing and able  
To defeat the snake, protect the weak  
Fight for rights and the freedom to speak  
Now the villain is showin', so you take a stand  
Back to the wall, put your sword in your hand  
Remember the words of your teacher, your master  
""Evil moves fast, but good moves faster""  
Then light, shining for your illumination  
Good versus evil equals confrontation

Hey, beating yourself up  
Tryna figure up how you wound up out in the cold  
Not only did you lose me, but the one that you was  
Cheatin' on me also left ya alone, no, I can't speak for her  
But that be mean(?) you had my mind and was clockin' my soul  
But it fell apart cuz you couldn't recall first lie that you told

Listen, baby, if you're gonna be a liar  
At least try to be good at it  
If you're gonna be a cheater

Got her on the roots(?)  
Or don't even play the game  
Cuz you got me so high  
Don't know what you doin'  
Such an ameture  
  
(Verse 2)  
Beating myself up  
Tryna figure out how you fooled me as long as you did  
Mad at myself, so anxious for love that I wasn't payin' attention  
But you got the best of me, gave you the best, best believe  
Never again, said I'm way to smart, so believe me, baby, never again

Listen, baby, if you're gonna be a liar

Don't know what you doin'

Smokin' mills(?), deception  
Pillow saltin' tears, rejection  
Your hopes and tears connect  
When our heart is treated with no care or discretion  
Ladies, what you fear is protection  
From fellas that don't know about affection  
But I'd try some love and affection  
Only Mr. Smith and Weston(?)

Baby, if you're gonna be a liar  
At least try to be good at it  
If you're gonna be a cheater

Or don't even play the game  
Cuz you got me so high  
Don't know what you doin'

Fighting a war I can't win, fighting a memory

No matter how hard I fight,

Keeps on defeating me, it just keeps on defeating me.

So what I'm trying to say, I know what's happening,  
Your body is here with me,  
But your heart and your mind is still with him.  
  
Go back to what you know,  
Go back to where you know where your heart is,  
Girl, just be honest, this is impossible,  
This is impossible, we'll never work cause you don't want it,  
Girl, you belong with him so just go back to what you know,  
Go back to what you know, because this is impossible.  
  
[Verse 2]  
Telling me things that you two, did when he was with you,  
How he was oh so sweet, the way that he used to treat you,  
Instead you just can't keep him outta your mind.  
Why can't you just tell me that I'm not who you want to be,  
Baby you don't want me, no, no, no.

Go back to what you know,  
Go back to where you know where your heart is,

I will not stand in your way, you want to be free  
I will let you be,

Damn, and I can't even do nothin'  
What I'm s'posed to do, tell her don't be happy?  
So that I can keep comin' around  
How messed up would that be?  
So I'm chillin'  
But I must admit, I'm kind of mad  
Ain't every day you find one like that  
Beautiful body with a brain to match  
Make a fella start feeling attached  
No filter fine, body, soul and mind  
Any man can't see that, he must be blind  
I'm Ray Charles with mine  
So I missed the train  
The only thing left to say is...

Single and happy, that's where I'm at  
And she wasn't ever approving of that  
She wanted me to give her more  
But I told her though, ain't long ago  
A relationship, I wasn't lookin' for  
In and out of town and always on the road  
But when I hit that city I called her though  
And that's wrong, so wrong  
She waited for me to come around so long, so long  
And now that wifey material is wifey material  
And if you ain't ready, the wife gotta let it go  
I wasn't, he was though  
So...

"[Intro]  
The story you 'bout to hear is complete fiction. It is however made up of a
group of stories, true stories about real people. Thus creating real
characters going through real things. Thus making the story itself real, true
and a real story, a true story, is non-fiction  
  
Our story begins in a dark place. A place where you learn that everything that
you wanted, could potentially be the very thing that leads to your
destruction. The very thing you should fear. This is a lesson learned the hard
way, experience being the only teacher. I mean you can't exactly tell a broke
man that money is evil and expect him to listen to you now can you? Naw he's
got to go down that road, he's got to face them demons himself before he can
acquire that knowledge. The money solves one group of problems only to
introduce another. Strangers become friends, friends become enemies. The fame,
just like any other drug feels incredible until you realize all that
adoration, all that love, ain't real. And the women, huh, the women, a drug
you use that uses you right back. A high for a high so to speak. Which brings
us to Tammy

You're thinking too little too late  
Cause it was me that said that we shouldn't be  
But that was before I could think straight  
My pride, it made me lie, lie, lie  
To you and to myself about what I need  
So now I walk around with this lie, truly dying inside

Sometimes I would rather turn the tv on,  
Simple is all I want  
Why put on a mask?  
Why be all a vision?  
There's never a reason  
I'm happy with me,  
My life's not in mission  
I'm ok with who I'm bein'  
Though I may not be who you want me to be  
But all I can be is me  
I won't pretend,  
So baby take it or leave  
'Cause all I can be is me (all I can be, all I can be)  
All I can be is me (all I can be, all I can be)  
Said all I can be is me  
What you get is what you see  
'Cause all I can be is me  
(Ooohh)  
Money, cars, and diamond rings  
All those expensive things  
Baby I just don't give a damn  
But if you really love me,  
Like you say you'd love me  
Then baby take me as I am  
(Heeeey)  
Though I may not be who you want me to be.  
But all I can be is me.  
I won't pretend,  
So baby take it or leave. (hey)

"[Verse 1:]  
Nights full of fears, eyes full of tears  
Cus you been hearin the same lies for 5 years.  
Fresh out of high school he pursued his career  
And you played the house wife roll for dude and his kids  
But now you can't get a break no matter how hard you try,  
Your life's on the line everytime you start up the ride  
Cus you never got ur L's but its hard not to drive  
When ur baby got a cold and the car is outside  
Plus the hospital is far and ur dude ran out on ya  
Just because he said that you had a mouth on ya,  
Becus you would scream and holla  
When he walk up in the room with maybeline up on his collar  
And he didn't even bother to consider his child  
He said he'd always be around but what's so different now?  
You stressin now cause you can figure it out  
But keep ur head in the clouds girl  
Continue to smile girl  
Cus baby you are a

Black angel, Oh baby you are so fly  
Black angel. Girl don't let him hold you down  
Get up and just spread your wings and fly  
Black angel  
  
[Verse 2:]  
He swept you off your feet when you met it was love at first sight  
He didn't even curse, said he was the Church type  
Was almost Mr. Right until ur first fight  
And you found out he was worse than ike  
Cus he hit you in the face so hard that I hurt to bite  
Now your uncertain of this person you liked  
But you keep making excuses for him being abusive  
Cause you want it to work this time  
So you convince your mind that it fine  
But in time your gonna find  
That real love aint defined with violence  
And if you're crying every night  
Just cause some guy decided its ahhite  
To hit you in the eye then its time  
That you learn from the mistakes  
Of those that chose to stay  
Cause most of em are gone today  
And there's a gang of sistas  
That would probably still be with us  
If they would've just flown away Ne-yo gone and sang  
  
[Chorus x 2:]  
(you're fly)  
Black angel, Oh baby you are so fly  
Black angel. Girl don't let him hold you down  
Get up and just spread your wings and fly

And start depending on the man above  
Babygirl stop depending on your man for love  
And start depending on the man above

Especially if your shine is outshining mine

See but the devil he could talk real loud  
And on my decision I'm not proud  
But by the grace of God I'm here right now  
Help being good and older  
So it's alright  
I know it may sound reckless to you  
Truthfully it's reckless to me too  
But that's what makes this song so true  
I'm a little irresponsible most of the time  
I'm a man of my word but only when I ain't lying  
I say I'm not a hater but I hate to see you shine  
Especially if your shine is outshining mine  
I wanna be thankful but I keep running into dimes  
And they make it so easy so it's hard to do right  
The image I portray making people judge a book  
But if they really took the time to look  
  
Then they will see the cracks in Mr. Perfect  
Yeah  
They will see the cracks in Mr. Perfect  
Yeah yeah  
  
Oh I do alot of stupid shit  
Hoping I never have to pay for rent  
It's like I become rather an idiot  
Every extra million I get  
I thank God for my family and my crew

Much love to my people that don't mind

So they will see the cracks in Mr. Perfect  
Yeah  
You can see the cracks in Mr. Perfect  
Yeah yeah  
You can see the cracks in Mr. Perfect  
Yeah  
Said you can see the cracks in Mr. Perfect  
Yeah

Find the beauty in your cracks

She was either 'bout that life

Either way, miss lady bad as a Toblerone sugar rush

""I think that I'm developing a little crush""  
She said ""Nice try, but every short skirt that done walked by has successfully
caught your eye  
No thanks but I'm sure that you're a nice guy""  
Damn, I had no reply, cause she was right  
Newly single so I've been a little thirsty  
She was more than just a booty in a skirt she  
Walked a way I caught up to her in a hurry  
I said ""Can I at least know your name before your dead me""  
She turned around and said ""My name's integrity""

Well damn, couldn't help but appreciate  
That she was bold enough to say this to my face  
She even went as far to give me her Twitter name  
She said, ""I tweeted you and told you the same thing""

Her mother's body but her brother's knowledge of the street  
Kick all you beautiful lies, shawty ain't goin' for 'em  
She type stubborn, like her daddy, but she don't know him  
Got me feelin' like I ain't good enough  
I ain't a D-boy or a thug so I ain't hood enough  
Or maybe it's the other way around and shawty's self esteem is down  
Not good enough to wife but good enough to fuck, nah mama

What's under your garden, not just what's under your clothes

Any time that we fall that just means we just climb together  
Guess we avoided what we could've went through

"Sa pag bukas ng radyo

Sinasaktan ako  
At ang lagay ng puso ko sumisigaw

Sa bawat oras na nakikinig ako  
Pilit kong patayin isarado  
Ang tugtuging tungkol  
Sa mga nagmamahaln at kaso  
Iba ang nangyari sa 'ting dalawa  
Naghiwalay dahil sa araw gabi  
Lagi nalang tayong nag-aaway  
  
At sa ngayon nagbago na ako  
Mas gugustuhin ko pang mag isa  
Kaysa masaktan pang muli  
Ito na ang huli tapos na  
Ang pagmamahalan dati kong minimithi  
Ngayon ko na tinatabi

Ang tanging isip at  
Panaginip kong nasira  
Di maka tiis nung marinig  
Ang himig ng radyong  
Hinatid sa'tin ng dati nating ala-ala  
Noong tayo pa noon ang magkasama at maligaya  
  
Pero ngayon wala at nasira sa pagdating ng tadhana  
Ikaw parin ang ibig makasama  
Makatabi walang problemang nadarama  
Pero wala na tapos na  
Kaya ngayon patuloy ang maglakbay  
Nang nag-iisa sa mga awitin to'y ako'y sawa na ngayon  
At isip sa sarili at puro sisi

Ang binohusan ng abala  
Silbihan ng habang buhay  
Sya'y maging maligaya

Yeah oh at kung bakit 'di magtanong sa langit  
Pagkalabit ko ang lapis pilit kong  
Isulat ang tunay na damdamin  
Nadarama kong hindi ka na talaga sa akin  
Ikaw, tayong dalawa punong puno ng akit  
Pagsisisi sa isip sa panaginip hatid pa rin  
Ay puno ng sakit at palagi nalang luha  
Ang binigay sa akin  
  
'di ko na kayang kayanin isipin  
Litrato natin gusto ko nang punitin  
At sa'kin dahil ikaw lang ang tunay kong minamahal  
Ang akin 'di gaya ng dati ang saya ang ligaya natin

"[Verse 1]  
Yo, I had to reinvent, I put the V in vent  
I put the heat in vents, man I been competin' since  
I look beyond what people sayin', and I see intent  
Then I just sit back and decipher, what they really meant  
Cherish these nights, cherish these people  
Life is a movie, but there will never be a sequel  
And I'm good with that, as long as I'm peaceful  
As long as 7 years from now, I'm taking my daughter to preschool  
Cherish these days, man do they go quick  
Just yesterday, I swear it was '06  
Ten years ago, that's when you proposed  
I look down, ""yes I suppose""  
  
[Hook]  
All things go, all things go  
All things go, all things go  
I feel a minute, yeah we got it then it's gone  
While we keep waiting for a moment 'til it falls  
So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong  
Cause I'ma ride I'm with you still the night is young  
We keep goin', we go, we go, we go  
We wake back up and do it all again  
We know, we know, say ""fuck the world"", we ridin' til the end  
I know its sudden, look at what we've become  
I just want you to know that I did it all for you  
  
[Verse 2]  
I lost my little cousin to a senseless act of violence  
His sister said he wanted to stay with me, but I didn't invite him  
Why didn't he ask, or am I just buggin'?  
Cause since I got fame, they don't act the same  
Even though they know that I love him  
Family ties broken before me, niggas trynna kill him, he ain't even call me  
And that's the reflection of me, yes I get it, I get it, it was all me  
I pop a pill and remember the look in his eyes, the last day he saw me

We know, we know, say ""fuck the world"", we ridin' til the end  
I know its sudden, look at what we've become  
I just want you to know that I did it all for you  
  
[Verse 3]  
Let me make this clear I'm not difficult, I'm just about my business  
I'm not into fake industry parties, and fake agendas  
Rock with people for how they make me feel not what they give me  
Even the ones that hurt me the most, I still show forgiveness  
I love my mother more than life itself, and that's a fact  
I'd give it all, if I could somehow, just rekindle that  
She never understands, why I'm so overprotective  
The more I work, the more I feel like, somehow they're neglected  
I want 'Caiah to go to college, just to say ""We did it!""  
My child with Aaron, would've been sixteen, any minute  
So in some ways I feel like 'Caiah, is the both of them  
It's like he's 'Caiah's little angel, looking over him  
And I know Jelani will always love me, and I'll always love him  
And I'm just his little sister not Nicki Minaj when I'm around him  
Yeah we did it, let's leave this imprint  
Just finished writing, this is The Pinkprint

I had to make them changes, I hope you understood  
You see for every bad, I did a ton of good  
But you was underground, and I was mainstream  
I live the life now, that we would daydream  
My only wish is you come enjoy it with me  
Get on them conference calls, go meet the lawyers with me  
The money came yea, tripled and quadrupled it  
But I still miss us when we was on some stupid shit

Maybe that is why I chase strangers away

But I become Neo when they aiming at me  
Me, me, me against them  
Me against enemies, me against friends  
Somehow they both seem to become one  
A sea full of sharks and they all smell blood  
They start coming and I start rising  
Must be surprising, I'm just surmising  
I win, thrive, soar, higher, higher, higher, more fire

Uh yo, yo  
Everybody wanna try to box me in  
Suffocating every time it locks me in  
Paintin' they own pictures than they crop me in  
But I will remain where the top begins  
'Cause I am not a word, I am not a line  
I am not a girl that can ever be defined  
I am not fly, I am levitation  
I represent an entire generation  
I hear the criticism loud and clear  
That is how I know that the time is near  
So we become alive in a time of fear  
And I ain't got no motherfucking time to spare

I admit I fell in love with her frame  
And to make her feel special I let her call me by my government name  
Her panties wet over fame  
Fall in love with my chain  
I wonder if I wasn't an entertainer would she remain  
Surrounding me hounding me trying to be my only  
I'm not your boyfriend I'm your homie.  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[50 Cent]  
(Yeah) What would fuck me up more  
Watching her lick her lips  
Or watching her walk she hypnotize me with her hips (yeah) man  
I sweet talking her if she like  
Cause all she really want is a nigga to treat her right right  
Look I'm legit now used to break laws  
Now you can reap the benefit of world tours  
Big house big Benz girl it yours  
Mink coats Italian shoes stones with no flaws  
You ain't go to look like a model for me to adore you  
All you gotta do is love me and be loyal  
Don't Indulge in my past fuck what happened before you  
Cause their be some homies gonna hate you that never saw you  
Come here let my touch on you I let you touch on me  
Put my tounge on you you put your tounge on me  
Let me ride on you and you can ride on  
We can do it all the night  
We can have a balla tonight  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
I wanna get to know you  
I wanna get to know you, baby  
One dose of my lovin'  
I'm simply gonna drive you, crazy  
  
I wanna be your lover  
I wanna get to know you, lady  
One dose of my lovin'  
I'm really gonna drive you, crazy

I wanna be your lover  
I really understand you, baby  
I want to be your lover  
I really understand you, baby, baby, baby, baby.

Do you ever think of me, when you lie?  
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies  
And I knew better, than to look in your eyes  
They only pretend, you will be mine  
And you know how you made me, believe  
You had me caught in every web, that you weaved  
But do you ever think of me, when you lie?  
Lie down in your bed your bed of lies

You could never make eye contact  
Everything you got was based off of my contacts  
You a fraud, but I'mma remain icon-stat  
Balenciaga's on my boots with the python strap  
You was caught up in the rush, and you was caught up in the thrill of it  
You was with me way before, I hit a quarter mil' in it  
Put you in the crib and you ain't never pay a bill in it  
I was killin' it, man you got me poppin' pills in it  
I told Baby hit you, I said this nigga buggin'  
Cause I was doing it for us, I told em fuck the public  
Couldn't believe that I was home alone, contemplating  
Overdosin', no more coastin', no more toastin' over oceans  
They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone  
They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn  
But there was something that I should've asked all along  
I'mma ask on the song

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]  
I just figured if you saw me, if you looked in my eyes  
You'd remember our connection and be freed from the lies  
I just figured I was something that you couldn't replace  
But there was just a blank stare and I couldn't relate  
I just couldn't understand and I couldn't defend  
What we had, what we shared, and I couldn't pretend  
When the tears roll down it's like you ain't even notice em  
If you had a heart, I was hoping you would've showed it some  
What the fuck you really telling me, what you telling me  
I could tell you lying, get the fuck out, don't yell at me  
I ain't mean to cut you, I ain't wanna catch a felony  
This ain't How To Be A Player, you ain't Bill Bellamy  
They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone  
They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn  
But there was something that I should've asked all along  
I'mma ask on the song  
  
[Bridge: Skylar]  
So does she know I've been in that bed before  
A thousand count, and not a single threaded truth  
If I was just another girl  
Then I'm ashamed to say that I'm not over you  
There's one thing I need to know  
So call me, when you're not so busy just thinking of yourself  
  
[Outro: Skylar]  
Do you ever think of me, when you lie?  
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies  
And I knew better, than to look in your eyes  
They only pretend, you will be mine  
And you know how you made me, believe  
You had me caught in every web, that you weaved

I'm a grab your waist then,  
I'm a grab your face and  
Then I'm a taste it,  
Then I'm a blaze it  
Hello all my bad girls,  
This just in

And she let him back in  
And he just did it again,  
He crazy, he blazin', he off the deep end  
I'm blazin' I'm flagrant, I'm crazy I'm saying  
Too much for the world so they a-bbreviate him  
His tatts is her fav', his stats is amaze  
Her dress is just per' uh  
Prada colored babes

And I'm rolling with my bricks  
So real you so trill baby everything legit  
How you feel, they say we crazed  
Cause our styles so diff'  
They be jail when we in the mag looking magnif'  
As if I ain't used Magnums on your favorite bad bitch

And she don't want nothing but my Johnson - Howard  
Sour Dies in the Swisher Sweet - sweet and sour  
You're scared? Go to church, say your prayers, read a Bible  
Ah! I don't know what y'all on - please

This is for the little girls that say Nicki you pretty  
When you come to the city you don't act high for Diddy?  
You be up on the block, posted up in the drop  
And everybody get up in whether you like it or not  
But how them girls blow up but don't come to the hood  
How they turn they nose up like they don't come from the hood  
Most of them be in sight til it's time to pitch  
That's when everything they write be a contradiction  
I tell em I do it for the love  
I do it for the hugs  
I do it for the buzz  
I do it for the thugs  
I do it for the rich  
I do it for the poor  
I do it for the kids that can't do no more

They'll bring back a lye if you bring them an O

One time for my niggas that be huggin' the block  
2 Times for my niggas that be ducking the cops  
3 Times for my girls that pushing they own rides  
Stooshing they own rides from bitches they don't like

And still I, never sweat these bitches  
Who be hanged like plaques on the wall and ya pictures  
Scalin fishes, my love is concrete  
Stashin ya heat in the passenger seat  
of the Nautica Jeep, we've been down for so long  
Still a bitch like me tryin to hold on  
Teary eyed, damn a bitch steamin  
Girls steady screamin, 'Kim you need to leave him!'  
When I testified in court, couldn't think straight  
thinkin bout the bitches I fought  
over you, nigga half the shit you bought  
And fuck you, movin is my last resort  
You see nine outta ten niggaz, ain't shit

Ya mad at me, too bad she ain't as bad as me  
Choulda kept the freak bitch off my canape  
Now you see, ain't no pussy warm as mine

Pull the truck up, front, and roll up the next blunt

A t-bone steak, cheese eggs and Welch's grape  
Conversate for a few, 'cause in a few, we gon' do

Bitches be scheming, I kid you not  
That's why I keep my windows locked and my Glock cocked

Why you swear all bitches are so scandalous?""  
Thug nigga until the end, tell a friend bitch  
Cause when I like you, then you go and fuck my friend bitch

I be cruising up the block, I be passing her  
Pimping hard with the female passenger  
And the only time I call her to hang  
Is when me and Dee blunted up, pissy, scheming on a gang-bang  
She should have used her intuition  
Then she wouldn't be classified in that position, listen  
She's saying I dissed her cause I'm fucking her sister  
A message to the fellas, that really gets them pissed, uh  
But she started that fucking family  
She fucked my man Dee, so why she mad at me? (True)

Blocker, Roc-a-, Fella, Bad Boy collabo  
Two MC's with mad dough, ju' know!  
  
I love the dough, more than you know  
Gotta let it show, I love the dough, hey

Gotta let it show, I love the dough, hey  
  
Miracu-lous, pockets stay full  
Niggaz skip the bull cause we matadors  
Snatch the P-89's that we pack in the drawers  
And we, clappin doors in your Acuras  
Snap like, cameras on amateurs  
Make you all dance, hold a hammer to yours  
Jig and Big rock ice, no cracks or flaws  
Erybody got a part to play, back to yours  
Run up in your crib now, crack your doors  
Watch the real players live, it's a habit to floss  
Play the charts like the Beatles, y'all adapt you lost  
And toast Cristal on behalf of y'all  
Too bad for y'all, ain't too many as bad as yours  
truly, do we, we laugh at y'all  
Little bastards y'all  
  
Uhh, uhh  
We hit makers with acres  
Roll shakers in Vegas, you can't break us  
Lost chips on Lakers, gassed off Shaq  
Country house, tennis courts on horseback  
Ridin decidin cracked crab or lobster  
Who say mobsters don't prosper  
Niggaz is actors, niggaz deserve Oscars  
Me I'm, critically acclaimed, slug past your brain  
Reminesce on dames who, coochie used to stink  
When we rocked house pieces and puffy Gucci links  
Now we buy homes in unfamiliar places  
Tito smile everytime he see our faces  
Cases catch more than outfield-ers  
Half these rappin cats, ain't seen war  
Couldn't score if they had point game, they lame  
Speak my name, I make em dash like Dame  
  
I love the dough, more than you know  
Gotta let it show, I love the dough, hey  
I love the dough, more than you know  
Gotta let it show, I love the dough, hey

"[Notorious B.I.G.]

We miss you nigga  
Goin out to all the niggas that died in the struggle  
Word up, shit is real in the field  
You know, sparkin blunts to all you niggaz  
Word up  
  
Each and every day  
The daydreams of how we used to be  
See your family  
And that baby's lookin just like you  
Why'd you go away  
I've been missin you lately  
Tell me why you're gone and through  
  
[Verse One: Notorious B.I.G.]  
I remember sellin three bricks of straight flour  
Got my man a beat down to the third power  
He didn't care, spent the money in a half hour  
Got some fishscale, ain't no competition that could sour  
Got the coke cooked up, a crackhead heaven  
In eighty-eight, when Kane ruled, with Half Steppin  
A thirty-eight, a lot of mouth, was our only weapon  
We was king till the G's crept in  
And now I'm missin em  
  
[Chorus]  
Ooh, I'm missin you  
Tell me why the road turns, why it turns  
Ooh, I'm missin you  
Nah nah nah nah nah, oh tell me why why why why  
  
[Verse Two: Notorious B.I.G.]  
We work all week, we dancin, play the movies  
We rock flatops, our girls rocked doobies  
Made a killin, even though the D's knew me  
Eventually, you know they try to do me  
Fuck it  
Fed up, my nigga want to take it down south  
Sick of cops comin, sick of throwin jacks in his mouth  
Gave him half my paper, told 'em go that route  
Few months, he got his brain blown out  
Now I'm stressed  
His baby's mother, she trippin, blamin me  
And his older brothers, understand, the game it be  
Kinda topsy turvy  
You win some, you lose some  
Damn, they lost a brother  
They mother lost a son  
Fuck, why my nigga couldn't stay in NY?  
I'm a thug, but I swear for three days I cried  
I look in the sky and ask God why  
Can't look his baby girls in the eye  
Damn I miss you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Verse Three: Notorious B.I.G.]  
There was this girl around the way that make cats drool  
Her name's Drew, played fools out they money in pool  
People swore we was fuckin but we was just cool  
She used to hang while I slang my drugs after school  
She'd watch my bomb, help my moms with the groceries  
My little sister, the girl was kinda close to me  
A little closer than the average girl's supposed to be  
Far from a lover, my girl was jealous of her  
Then she started messin with some major players  
Handled keys, niggas called them the Bricklayers  
A dread kid, had a baby fore that bitch Taya  
Found out her baby's father cheatin, now Drew she gotta slay her  
One night, across from the corner store  
Taya ran around the block with a chrome four-four  
Squeezed all six shots in the passenger door  
The dude lived, what my baby had to die for  
We missin her

Tell me who rock? Who sell out in the stores?  
You tell me who flopped? Who copped the blue drop?

The same old pimp, Mase, you know, ain't nothing change but my limp  
Can't stop till I see my name on a blimp  
Guarantee a million sales pulling all the love  
You don't believe in Harlem World, nigga, double up  
We don't play around, it's a bet, lay it down  
Nigga didn't know me '91, bet they know me now  
I'm the young harlem nigga with the goldie sound  
Can't no Ph.D. niggas hold me down, Cooter  
Schooled me to the game, now I know my duty

"As a child Christopher was outspoken when it suited him at times he was quiet

Father had no influence on his decision towards the musical outlet are career
he  
Chose my son had a mind of his own even if his father was around he would have  
Turned to rap he loved music he loved rap at a point in my sons life he

Chosen that life style that career my son would be alive today if I could sum

"1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9  
  
It's the ten crack commandments, what?  
Nigga can't tell me nothing about this coke  
Can't tell me nothing about this crack, this weed, my hustlin' niggas  
Niggas on the corner I ain't forget you niggas, my triple beam niggas  
  
I've been in this game for years, it made me an animal  
It's rules to this shit, I wrote me a manual  
A step-by-step booklet for you to get  
Your game on track, not your wig pushed back  
Rule Number Uno, never let no one know  
How much dough you hold cause you know  
The cheddar breed jealousy 'specially  
If that man fucked up, get yo' ass stuck up  
Number 2, never let 'em know your next move  
Don't you know Bad Boys move in silence and violence?  
Take it from your highness  
I done squeezed mad clips at these cats for their bricks and chips  
Number 3, never trust no-bo-dy  
Your moms'll set that ass up, properly gassed up  
Hoodied and masked up, shit, for that fast buck  
She be laying in the bushes to light that ass up  
Number 4, I know you heard this before  
Never get high on your own supply  
Number 5, never sell no crack where you rest at  
I don't care if they want a ounce, tell 'em bounce!  
Number 6, that goddamn credit? Dead it  
You think a crackhead paying you back, shit forget it!  
7, this rule is so underrated  
Keep your family and business completely separated  
Money and blood don't mix like 2 dicks and no bitch  
Find yourself in serious shit  
Number 8, never keep no weight on you!  
Them cats that squeeze your guns can hold jums too  
Number 9 shoulda been Number 1 to me,  
If you ain't gettin' bagged stay the fuck from police  
If niggas think you snitchin' they ain't trying to listen  
They be sittin' in your kitchen, waiting to start hittin'  
Number 10, a strong word called consignment  
Strictly for live men, not for freshmen  
If you ain't got the clientele, say ""hell no!""  
'Cause they gon' want they money rain sleet hail snow  
Follow these rules you'll have mad bread to break up  
If not, 24 years on the wake up  
Slug hit your temple, watch your frame shake up  
Caretaker did your makeup, when you passed  
Your girl fucked my man Jake up, heard in three weeks  
She sniffed a whole half of cake up  
Heard she suck a good dick, and can hook a steak up  
Gotta go gotta go, more pies to bake up, word up

1970 Somethin' nigga i don't sweat the date my moms was late,  
So i had to plan my escape, out the skins,  
In this world the fly girls, tangeray and hennesey,  
Untill i call earl, 10 months in this gut, wut the fuck,  
I wish moms would hurry up, so i can get buck wild,  
Juvenile with the mics n shit, New York New York, ready for the likes of this,  
Then came the worst date, May 21st 2:19 was when my moma water burst,  
No spouse in the house, so she rolled herself,  
To the hospital, to see if she could get a little help,  
Umbilicle cords wrapped around my neck,  
Im seein' my death, and i ain't even took my first step,  
I made it out im bringin' mad joy,  
The docter looked and said he's gonna be BAD BOY!

I mean, i wanna blow up, stack my doe up,  
So school i didn't show up, and fucked my flow up,  
Mom said that i should grow up, and check myself,  
Before i wreck myself, disrespect myself,  
Put the drugs on the shelf, naww! i couldn't see it,  
Scarface king of New York, i wanna be it,  
Rap was secondary, money was neccessary,  
Untill i got encarcerated, kinda scary,

(Verse One)  
  
Relax and take note  
While I take totes of the marijuana smoke  
Throw you in choke  
Gun smoke gun smoke  
Biggie Smalls for mayor  
The rap slayer the hooker layer  
Muthafucka say your prayers  
(Hail Mary full of grace)  
Smack the bitch in her face  
Take her Gucci bag and the North Face off her back  
Jab her if she act  
Funny wit the money  
Oh you got me mistakin honey  
I don't wanna rap ya  
I just want the paper  
The Visa capisha  
I'm out like the vapors  
Who's the one the call mister macho  
The head honcho  
Swift fist like camacho  
I got so  
Much style I should be down wit the stylistics  
Make up to break up  
Niggas need to wake up  
Smell the indonesia beat you to a ceasure  
Then fuck your mom hit them skins to amnesia  
She don't remember shit just the two hits  
Her hittin the floor and me hittin the clit  
Suckin on her tit  
Had the hooker beggin for the dick  
And your moms ain't ugly love my dick got rock quick  
I guess I was a combination of House of Pain and Bobby Brown  
I was humpin around and jumpin around  
Jacked her then I asked her who's the man  
She said B-I-G then I bust in her E-Y-E  
  
Yo Big your dead wrong  
(I don't care what nobody say)  
Your dead wrong

Jump in my Acura Vigor after I stick ya  
Rip ya like razor straight up henny wit no chasa  
Watch me erase ya misplace ya  
Put ya in the back wit the derelects

Chump i'm makin hits  
No time for that crack rockin shit  
Took you to another level  
Now i'm gettin crazy pates  
Gettin paid from the devil  
Another amatuer tryna damage the pedigree  
Of the B-I-G-G-I-E you know it's me  
Hoes I thought you knew i'm smooth as a baby's ass  
Smooth as Teddy Pentergras  
Smoke the grass get in ya ass

Gettin props provin nobody drops  
Words as potent as the blunt smokin Bed Stuy bandit  
And niggas just can't understand it  
I bust a cap for my brothers in Nappmack,Comstock,and Clinton  
You know my shit is hittin  
Yeah ya'll the fly nigga Biggie Smalls  
Kickin flavor make a nigga dig up in they draws  
For the burn that catch your body  
I got styles like karate  
Jujitsu when I hit you  
Then I split you like a cantaloupe  
Hope you gotta rope to hang yourself  
I rhyme for self  
From Brooklyn where else  
Back like a Lexus coop i'll rip your troup  
Not even Lois Lane could get the scoop  
What you think i'm stupid muthafucka

Fucked around and made some shit you can't fuck with  
They thought luck did it, but it didn't cause I'm back again  
Back with the Big and my new-found friend

Yeah, you on my shit list, Biggie burns spliffs  
When I'm pissed, release the Rolex from your wrist

In they draws, because Biggie Smalls  
Is far from weak -- Brat-tat-tat, please speak...

The raw combination, the destination,  
Number one tote a gun with no hestiation

Now baby Biggie, I done heard that Juicy  
Didn't find nuthin but truth, in the hook B  
You're pledging to wreck with a notorious nigga ready to die  
Jump in the Benz, took me a little ride  
Round the mountain, broke a left, hit Sosodef  
And told the nigga jd I was the one, fuck the rest

Smokin weed and Bambu, sippin on Private Stock

You never thought that hip hop would take it this far

Spread love, it's the Brooklyn way  
The Moet and Alize keep me pissy  
Girls used to diss me  
Now they write letters cause they miss me

Sold out seats to hear Biggie Smalls speak  
Livin life without fear  
Puttin 5 karats in my baby girl's ears  
Lunches, brunches, interviews by the pool

Just for niggaz actin shifty  
Sticks and stones break bones, but the gat'll kill you quicker

Sixteen shots for my niggaz in the pen  
Until we motherfuckin meet again  
Huh, I'm doin rhymes now, fuck the crimes now  
Come on the ave, I'm real hard to find now  
Cause I'm knee deep in the beats  
In the Land Cruiser Jeep with the Mac-10 by the seats  
For the jackers, the jealous ass crackers in the (car sirens)

How I smoked funk, smacked bitches on the backside  
Bed-Stuy, the place where my head rests  
Fifty shot clip if a nigga wan' test  
The rocket launcher, Biggie stomped ya  
High as a motherfuckin helicopter  
That's why I pack a nina, fuck a misdeameanor  
Beatin motherfuckers like Ike beat Tina

When I'm rippin all through your whole crew  
Strapped like bamboo, but I don't sling guns  
I got bags of funk, and it's sellin by the tons

I wish moms'd hurry up so I could get buck  
wild juvenile rippin' mics and shit  
New York New York ready for the likes of this uh  
Then came the worst date May 21st  
2:19, that's when my momma water burst  
No spouse in the house so she rode for self  
to the hospital, to see if she could get a little help  
Umbilical cord's wrapped around my neck  
I'm seein' my death and I ain't even took my first step  
I made it out, I'm bringin' mad joy  
The doctor looked and said, ""He's gonna be a Bad Boy""  
  
Now I'm thirteen, smokin' blunts, makin' cream  
On the drug scene, fuck a football team  
Riskin' ruptured spleens by the age of sixteen  
Hearin' the coach scream at my lifetime dream, I mean  
I want to blow up, stack my dough up  
So school I didn't show up, it fucked my flow up  
Mom said that I should grow up and check myself  
before I wreck myself, disrespect myself  
Put the drugs on the shelf? Nah, couldn't see it  
Scarface, King of New York, I want to be it  
Rap was secondary, money was necessary  
Until I got incarcerated--kinda scary  
C74-Mark 8 set me straight  
Not able to move behind the great steel gate  
Time to contemplate, damn, where did I fail?  
All the money I stacked was all the money for bail  
  
Ninety-four, now I explore new horizons  
Mama smile when she see me, that's surprisin'  
Honey's is tantalizin', they freak all night  
Peep duckin' cops on the creep all night  
As I open my eyes and realizin' I changed  
Not the same deranged child stuck up in the game  
And to my niggas livin' street life  
Learn to treat life to the best, put stress to rest  
Still tote your vest man, niggas be trippin'  
In the streets without a gat? Nah, nigga you're slippin'

Why am I trying to see, when there ain't nothing in sight  
Why I am I trying to give, when no one gives me a try  
Why am I dying to live, if I'm just living to die  
  
Check it, I grew up a fuckin' screw up  
Got introduced to the game, got a ounce and fuckin' blew up  
Choppin' rocks overnight

We had to grow dreads to change our description  
Two cops on the milk box missin'  
Show they toes you know they got stepped on  
A fist full of bullets a chest full of Teflon  
Run from the police picture that, nigga I'm too fat  
I fuck around and catch a asthma attack  
That's why I bust back, it don't phase me  
When he drop, take his glock, and I'm Swayze  
Celebrate, my escape, sold the glock, bought some weight  
Laid back, I got some money to make, motherfucker

And still I'm havin' memories of high speeds, when the cops crashed  
As I laugh pushin' the gas when my glocks blast  
We was young, and we was dumb but we had heart  
In the dark when we survived through the bad parts  
Many dreams is what I had, and plenty wishes  
No hesitation in extermination of these snitches  
And these bitches they still continue to pursue me  
A couple of movies now the whole world tryin' to screw me  
Even the cops tried to sue me so what can I do  
But stay true, sippin' 22's a brewin'now the medias tryin'  
To test me got the press askin' questions, tryin' to stress me  
Misery is all I see, that's my mind's state  
My history with the police is shakin' the crime rate  
Ma main man had two strikes, slipped, got arrested and flipped  
He screamed, ""Thug Life"" and emptied a clip  
Gots tired of runnin' from the police

Baby accept it, utmost respect it  
[Assume the position] Stop look and listen  
I spit on your grave then I grab my Charles Dickens  
  
Welcome to my center  
Honies feel it deep in they placenta  
Cold as the pole in the winter  
Far from the inventor, but I got this rap shit sewed  
And when my Mac unloads  
I'm guaranteed another video  
Ready to die, why I act that way?  
Pop Duke left Mom Duke  
The faggot took the back way  
So instead of makin hoes suck my dick up  
I used to do stick-up  
Cause hoes is irritatin like the hic-CUPS  
Excuse me, flows just grow through me  
Like trees to branches  
Cliffs to avalanches  
It's the praying mantis  
Deep like the mind of Farrakhan  
A motherfuckin rap phenomenon, plus

I make it hot [Nigga won't even stand next to you]  
Nigga touch me you better bust me

Jack Dempsey would start shakin'  
All it's takin, is some marijuana and I'm makin'

"Remember back in the days, when niggaz had waves  
Gazelle shades, and corn braids  
Pitchin pennies, honies had the high top jellies  
Shootin skelly, motherfuckers was all friendly  
Loungin at the barbeques, drinkin brews  
With the neighborhood crews, hangin on the avenues  
Turn your pagers, to nineteen ninety three  
Niggaz is gettin smoked g, believe me  
Talk slick, you get your neck slit quick  
Cause real street niggaz ain't havin that shit  
Totin techs for rep, smokin blunts in the project  
Hallways, shootin dice all day  
Wait for niggaz to step up on some fightin shit  
We get hype and shit and start lifin shit  
So step away with your fist fight ways  
Motherfucker this ain't back in the days, but you don't hear me though  
  
No more cocoa leave-io, one two three  
One two three, all of this to me, is a mystery  
I hear you motherfuckers talk about it  
But I stay seein bodies with the motherfuckin chalk around it  
And I'm down with the shit too  
For the stupid motherfuckers wanna try to use kung-fu  
Instead of a mac-10 he tried scrappin  
Slugs in his back and, that's what the fucks happenin  
When you sleep on the street  
Little motherfuckers with heat, want ta leave a nigga six feet deep  
And we comin to the wake  
To make sure the cryin and commotion ain't a motherfuckin fake  
Back in the days, our parents used to take care of us  
Look at em now, they even fuckin scared of us  
Callin the city for help because they can't maintain  
Damn, shit done changed  
  
If I wasn't in the rap game  
I'd probably have a key knee deep in the crack game  
Because the streets is a short stop  
Either you're slingin crack rock or you got a wicked jumpshot  
Shit, it's hard being young from the slums  
Eatin five cent gums not knowin where your meals comin from  
And now the shit's gettin crazier and major  
Kids younger than me, they got the sky grand pagers  
Goin outta town, blowin up  
Six months later all the dead bodies showin up  
It make me wanna grab the nine and the shottie  
But I gotta go identify the body  
Damn, what happened to the summertime cookouts?  
Everytime I turn around a nigga gettin took out  
Shit, my momma got cancer in her breast  
Don't ask me why I'm motherfuckin stressed, things done changed

Now, Biggie Smalls is not the type to fall in love  
When I just hit em' and forget em' and go handle my business  
I like the kind who wine and dine, who grinding all the time  
Your X girl was a 5, but you not let up on a dime  
What is this with you? All you wannah do is lay around  
And stay around and get mad when I play around  
I like to lay, never work, put your money in my purse  
To the mall, I'll go search matching shoes for my skirt  
Tuesday, I saw you in a Z, but you still wannah get with me

Baby, I'm Big Poppa, ain't no need to be tripping  
I ain't tripping or flipping, I'm just niggah sipping  
At the bar tipping, with your money, can you pay the difference?  
It seems like it's a waste of time, that's why I wrote the rhyme  
I hear you jumping in every car except for mine  
Niggah, I don't jump in cars, I'm a superstar  
Face way too flaw, You should hang me on your wall  
All I do all day is drink Tanguray  
Thinking of a way to put a smile on your face  
Make me smile, see them teeth, Milo, cut down to them feets  
Chubby waste, my physique, me don't want a freak a leek  
Should I wine and dine and put rings on your fingers?  
While sex from the next man in the bedroom lingers?  
Sex will never linger, hold up, put on your blinkers  
I flow just like sprinklers, give your ass the middle finger  
You'd better slow your role, baby  
You ain't got enough dough to pay me  
You know the pen number, just page me  
When you're real, baby  
Damn Ma, I love you like a lot  
Gonja, sensamelia, can I feel ya?

I chill, my homeboy said this was the D.A.I.S.Y. age  
I take it as meaning you have to get crazy paid  
You hope I'm from your borough, because I'm thorough  
You want me to be down with you, to be seen walking around with you  
Go to the store and buy a brew and rock a rhyme or two  
So you can bite it, you taste it, you like it  
You think I'm sleeping on you? Please, don't even try it  
The name is Latifah, the scene, it is mine  
The 45 King keeps the beat and the time while I  
Rock to the rhythm and keep it blowing out  
So don't try to turn me inside out  
Latifah is the name you love

Cause I am Latifah, the Queen of course  
Don't try to get yours off, because the cause is lost

Won't you chill? I don't need another victim  
To add to the list of aggrivation  
Subtracting suckers like a math computation  
We are not teaching pupils and subjects with no scruples  
This is a King and Queen creation  
So hello hello hello and how ya doing?  
Forget the smalltalk now, it's time for me to ruin  
Those who don't believe in what I'm saying  
When I put up the wall of words ain't no way into my Queendom  
Controlled by me, the heir to the throne is the Ruler Lord Ramsey  
The Ruler Lord, to him there is no equal  
He grabs it and starts bombing people

Because you can't turn my mind inside out  
Latifah is the name you love  
Flying through rhymes like a dove  
Slapping suckers with a glove  
Challenge me and you will burn  
Yes in the fire you will burn  
Rhyming's not a question of one superiority  
But rather how you delegate the use of your authority  
I know who you are, and I know who you are to me  
But I came here just to party  
If it's a show you want, the show it live  
And if it's trouble you seek, I have arrived  
When Mark requests my approval, I nod  
And after each and every single rhyme I thank God  
although a taste of my body would soothe you  
I give you just my voice and watch the rhythm move you  
The method of my lyrics makes the funky people feel it  
And Lord have mercy on those that try to steal it  
Latifah is a name meaning ""delicate and sensitive""  
But I have no problem formulating sentences  
To break you down to the ground  
I won't use violence, the color of this is brown  
And I am down, but never ever down and out  
So don't try to turn me inside out  
Latifah is the name you love  
Flying through rhymes like a dove  
Slapping suckers with a glove  
Challenge me and you will burn  
Yes in the fire you will burn

Ha ha, I was thinking the same thing  
Well I was approached by a whole damn group of them  
Rhyme thieves, biters, and bums  
Took me kind of light, said they wanted to fight  
I kinda got uptight (You didn't do what I think you did?) Yeah, right!  
  
Bash! went the first, Smash! went the next one (What about the third?)  
He started, he started to run  
But to his surprise, his feet must have slipped  
Cause I snapped that neck before the second step  
  
You see you may speculate, but everybody knows  
Not one amateur can deal with the pros  
  
These are the pros, coming now from Queen Latifah and Daddy-O  
And if you want to hear more then just follow  
If you like the smooth chanted lyrics then just say ""Bo bo bo!""  
  
There was a time that a man could go  
Anyplace, anywhere without a Rambo  
But now me have to keep me pistol loaded with rhyme  
Have to deal with bad breath biters that step out of line  
  
So when they make a move them surely get a taste of it  
I'm Daddy-O and I don't quit  
So feel the flow, y'all because you're under attack  
From my rhymes, 'cause I'm writing swift rhymes in stacks  
  
And four words to the wack, just, ""Stay the hell back""  
Cause it's a fact, if you're wack you ain't saying jack  
So we can go rhyme for rhyme if you wish  
But eating you suckers is my favorite dish  
And I warned you suckers if you messed with me  
You'll be the next ingredient in my recipe  
  
Start and don't finish, I'll hunt you down  
And you can't run forever, so you'll be found  
And with nowhere to run, and nowhere to hide  
How you want to be eaten, boy, baked or fried?  
  
[Chorus: x 2]  
  
It's Latifah the Queen, pioneer of the mainstream  
I flow just like a pro cause it's the same thing  
Suckers have to realize how foolish they sound  
So button your lips and stop trying to be down  
  
I caught you out there (How many times?)  
A lot of times  
Cause when it comes to mine, you know I gotta rhyme  
Stepping to the right, to the left  
To the best place, well I have to face  
  
A sucker like a pooh-butt, weak and soft  
Riding my bra strap trying to get off  
Understand and know, if you want to go  
You'd better be ready to flow 'cause I'm a pro  
  
[Chorus: x 2]  
  
We wax floors with bums, make mocks out of some  
Sting 'em hard, and watch them complain how it stung  
Kidnap the babysitter, lock 'em inside a box  
Daddy-O and the true blue Queen of Rock  
  
[Chorus: x 4]

We ain't gettin' down like that  
You took a hug to the next level, try to spit that  
  
Counterfeit, nice shit put on the act trick  
Try to get a quick kiss and you got snapped quick  
I tried to be nice and play it all smooth  
Well I guess done has somethin' to prove

Didn't wanna do the kid 'cause I knew the kid  
Didn't really wanna do no harm  
I don't know what I did but I didn't mean to turn you on

When you show a lil' kindness, cats wanna flow  
Want some mo' neck shit, some mo' sex shit  
Well, you tell 'em from the door, it's strictly friendship  
  
Didn't mean to turn you on  
Why apologize? I ain't do nothin' wrong  
You knew what the deal was, what the real was  
You was confused with the levels of love  
  
I seen you in the club with your eyes on me  
All night lookin' asinine, up under the strobe light  
More thin ice, there's still ?  
When it break through I don't think we could be friends  
  
If you sayin' you a playa, baby, live like one  
You play yourself like a bomb, never gettin' none  
And say beggin' for some and never get it  
If I turned you on, I guess you gotta live with it  
  
I took you out, I was only tryin' to be nice  
Let you touch it once or twice

I didn't mean to turn you on  
I didn't mean to turn you on  
I didn't mean to turn you on  
  
So what you mad now, got a attitude now  
'cause I had to pull your foul?  
Frontin' big Willie style when you're a major joke  
Pagin' me so much till my pager smoked  
  
Got your Eskimo kiss and shit  
Your nose's too brown, how you get chicks to trip  
Well I ain't the one, I could buy you and your whip  
Hold your head 'cause I've got so many hits, what?  
  
I took you out, I was only tryin' to be nice  
Let you touch it once or twice  
Oh, I didn't mean to turn you on

"Let's start the show off sisters ago look alive  
The Queen Latifah the King of 45  
Bringing a mixture of pure flavor  
I make beats she rock rhymes so I gave a  
A sample sound the she added a compound  
Word this is for those who haven't heard  
A King and Queen combine minds and trample  
Those who oppose us here's an example  
  
It's time to run, the King and Queen is on the set  
The competition is petty and ready to step  
To the first one, go ahead, rehearse one  
I hope you don't know you sound like the worst one  
Rhymes are smoking, concentration can't be broken  
Queen Latifah's outspoken  
Use your imagination, picture this  
Any male or female rapper trying to diss  
Here for excitement and enticement  
With my competitors killed I go build with my enlightenment  
Teach the youth, feed the needy  
Confident descendant of Queen Nefertiti  
The mother of civilization will rise  
Like the cream and still build the strong foundation  
Secondary but necessary to reproduce  
Acknowledge the fact that I'm black and I don't lack  
Queen Latifah is giving you a piece of my mind  
A rhyme spoken by a feminine teacher  
Rhymes I do employ, no time for slimy toys  
I'm steady and stable and the label is Tommy Boy  
Backed by The Unit, produced by The King  
Perfection pressed with the style that we bring  
For the hip-hop patients, this is a King and Queen creation  
  
Technician, musical musician  
I'm stating the facts, strictly non-fiction  
In hip-hop, you wonder who's in trouble most  
Creativity, you get a double dose  
How can you stop me? No, I put you to a test  
The rhymes are Romeo (The beat's a Juliet)  
With topic blend, this makes me a hard one  
Persevere, I'm here, gets taught one  
Strength producer, I send you an ultimatum  
Hardcore worldwide is how I take 'em  
I rock, never hyperventilate  
Others get tired, could use a commercial break  
45 King, DJ Mark's my alias  
It takes a ton of M-C's to prevail against me  
Just listen, I'm unstoppable  
You want a mission? This one's impossible  
Beats rock all night with no curfew  
My talent's advanced, you haven't a clue  
How I do it, the smoothest loopest spare it  
If the style fits, I wear it  
Many attempts were made, none was recognized  
45 King said sample soundified  
I'm going to Wonderland to check, find out who's next  
You pretty good, but not quite a legend yet  
Studio mixer, I got the formula  
And said the man from self, I'm warning you  
It's my domain, just ask my chauffeur  
My ride's equipped everything from a pool to a sofa  
On top, it's a usual act  
Can't wait to get down to 45 Studios  
I'm into rap, but no urge to sing  
I'm DJ Mark, 45, 45 King of Swing

"This day and age we're living in  
Gives cause for apprehension  
With speed and new invention

Yet we get a trifle weary

So we must get down to earth at times  
Relax relieve the tension  
And no matter what the progress  
Or what may yet be proved  
The simple facts of life are such  
They cannot be removed  
  
You must remember this  
A kiss is still a kiss,  
A sigh is just a sigh  
The fundamental things apply  
As time goes by  
  
And when two lovers woo  
They still say, ""I love you""  
On that you can rely  
No matter what the future brings  
As time goes by  
  
Moonlight and love songs  
Never out of date  
Hearts full of passion  
Jealousy and hate  
Woman needs man  
And man must have his mate  
That no one can deny  
  
Well, it's still the same old story  
A fight for love and glory  
A case of do or die  
The world will always welcome lovers

"Hey old friend let's look back  
On the crazy clothes we wore  
Ain't it fun to look back  
And to see it's all been done before  
  
All those nights together  
Are a special memory  
And I can't wait for tomorrow  
Just as long as you're dancing next to me  
  
'Cause it's so clear every year we get stronger  
What's gone is gone, the past is the past  
Turn the radio up and then hit the gas 'cause  
  
I know we've come so far  
But we've got so far to go  
I know the road seems long  
But it won't be long 'till it's time to go  
  
So most days we'll take it fast  
And some nights we'll take it slow  
I know we've come so far  
But baby, baby we've got so far to go  
  
Hey old friend together  
Side by side and year by year  
The road was filled with twists and turns  
Oh, but that's the road that got us here  
  
Let's move past the bad times  
But before those memories fade  
Let's forgive but not forget  
And learn from the mistakes we made  
  
'Cause it's so clear every year we get stronger  
So don't give up and don't say when  
And just get back on the road again 'cause  
  
I know we've come so far  
But we've got so far to go  
I know the road seems long  
But it won't be long 'till it's time to go

And some nights we'll take it slow  
I know we've come so far  
But baby, baby we've got so far to go  
  
Hey old friend come along for this ride  
There's plenty of room so jump inside  
The highway's rocky every now and then  
But it's so much better then where I've been  
  
Just keep movin' at your own speed  
Your heart is all the compass you'll ever need  
Let's keep cruisin' the road we're on  
'Cause the rear view mirror only shows what's gone, gone, gone  
We got so far to go  
  
Oh, it's so clear every year we get stronger  
So shine that light, take my hand  
Let's dance into the promise land 'cause  
  
I know we've come so far  
But we've got so far to go  
I know the road seems long  
But it won't be long 'till it's time to go

"It's a fact I'll attest to, mess around and I'll arrest you  
I ain't playing, you know what I'm saying?  
This ain't the best you've ever hear coming from a female MC  
But you know what I mean? (Hail to the Queen!)  
This MC stands for ""Microphone Commando""  
When I command that you take a hand  
And throw it up in the air, yeah, just like that now  
Chill, and watch me rap cause I'm flowing (Flowing)  
Just like water I slaughter (Slaughter)  
A battle, put me in it, I win it  
The mission is music and rhythm  
Rhythm backed by words, all in my system  
System by techniques, techniques I got my heart in  
Heart into the music, music I take part in  
One try, one God, and one destiny  
Just dance for me  
""Dance to the music"" (Repeat 2x)  
Now understand that you must (dance) because this is a beat to clap to  
My brother Lance said ""Latifah you got to make them get up off their feet""  
So I put my rhyme to a DJ Mark beat  
Ample samples, this for example  
Are made by the 45 King, so cancel  
Your plans of moving to the front lines  
He's a DJ, producer, and mind you a friend of mine  
I hop, dip, and spend with the children  
So get down with the sound and you will lend  
To let me bring while I bring  
Queen Latifah to the 45 King, creating  
A new style in the name of the Flavor Unit  
That's the way we like it, so I'm doing it  
So if you want to know what the plan is to be  
I order you to dance for me  
""Dance to the music"" (Repeat 2x)  
My voice is your choice at a stage show  
I do it for the Flavor Unit to make you say ""ho""  
With powerful lyrics I'm armed  
To let a sucker step up and get bombed  
By a beat created by my producer  
To break you out of the stuff that you're used to  
This here is a moment of truth  
So take the record to the DJ booth  
And let's start this, let the beat get dumb  
Cause I'm a shake it all night and then some  
People dancing, I can spot 'em  
When I take control, you know I got 'em  
Stop the music? That's not a question  
The Flavor Unit takes no suggestions  
If you're not on the dance tip, here's your chance to be  
I order you to dance for me  
""Dance to the music"" (Repeat 6x)

"You asked I came so behold the Queen  
Let's add a little sense to the scene  
I'm living positive not out here knocked up  
But the lines are so dangerous I ought to be locked up  
  
This rhyme doesn't require prime time  
I'm just sharing thoughts of mine  
Back again cause I knew you wanted it  
From the Latifah with the Queen in front of it  
  
Dropping bombs you're up in arms, you're puzzled  
The lines will flow like fluid while you guzzle  
The sip I drop you on a BDP-produced track  
From KRS to be exact  
  
It's a Flavor Unit quest that today has me speaking  
Cause it's knowledge I'm seeking  
Enough about myself, I think it's time that I tell you  
About the evil that men do  
  
Situations, reality, what a concept!  
Nothing ever seems to stay in step  
So today, here is a message to my sisters and brothers  
Here are some things I want to cover  
  
A woman strives for a better life, but who the hell cares?  
Because she's living on welfare  
The government can't come up with a decent housing plan  
So she's in no man's land  
It's a sucker who tells you you're equal  
  
KRS-One: You don't need him, Johannasburg's crying for freedom!  
  
Queen Latifah: We the people hold these truths to be self-evident  
  
[KRS-One]  
But there's no response from the president  
  
Queen Latifah:  
Someone's living the good life, tax-free  
Except for a girl, can't find a way to be crack free  
And that's just part of the message  
I thought I had to send you about the evil that men do  
  
Tell me, don't you think it's a shame?  
When someone can put a quarter in a video game  
But when a homeless person approaches you on the street  
You can't treat him the same  
  
It's time to teach the def, the dumb, the blind  
That black-on-black crime only shackles and binds  
You to a doom, a fate worse than death  
But there's still time left  
  
Stop putting your conscience on cease  
And bring about some type of peace  
Not only in your heart, but also in your mind  
It will benefit all mankind  
Then there will be one thing that will never stop  
And it's the evil that men do

And there's no forecast of rainfall

Some of the bad ones took a turn for the better  
And some of the good ones ended up sad ones  
You see? loving, it ain't hard to get  
I want a friend not just a lover  
Someone who is dedicated only to me  
Not to me and two or three others  
One who will not lie to me or think  
He can get my love by buying me  
I know I'll find him some day

And I'm cooling, first day of the week  
So there's nothing to do  
And I'm in the mood for a real soft kiss

So I called her and we talked for a while  
Hang up the phone feeling better  
With a smile  
  
It's cool, 'cause 91 is my year

Singin' in the shower, laughin' by the hour  
Life is such a breezy game  
Love all kinds of weather, as long we're together  
I love to hear you say my name  
  
I like good wine and fine cuisine  
And candle light, I like the scene  
But baby, if you know what I mean  
'Cause I love being here with you  
I love being here with you  
  
I like a dance by Fred Astaire  
And Brando's eyes, Yul Brynner's hair  
But I think to tell you's only fair  
That I love being here with you  
  
And Cary Grant, oh do-dah-day  
His utter charm takes me away  
But don't get me wrong, how do you say  
I love being here with you  
  
Oh, Basie's band's a-swingin', I like Ella singin'  
'Cause there's something else, you know  
They know how to say it, they know how to play it  
They wind it up and let it go  
  
I love the thrill of New York shows  
I'd love to Durante's nose  
But I'd like to say before I close, yeah, yeah  
I just love, baby I love, well, I love being here with you

So I land cruise, play I want to be's  
A kid in the increase gettin jack right in front of me  
So I pull the tech close, my finger's on the trigger  
Don't want to get wet, so they step

But better yet, I'ma threat, so ya better walk  
Or get sketched out in chalk, cause I don't want to talk

Watchin a cop cuff a kid for sellin a clip to a D.T.  
But it's home, so I flex, get pressure's off my chest  
Slip in a tape, now which hood should I hit next  
Stomach ache, had a steak, and take for a bean pie  
Get a final call for the brother in a bow-tie  
I'm from little kid's, dream, and fiend for fun  
Lots of laughter moms, no pops playin wit her son  
I pass by a girl wake, they say she died at seven  
Hit by a stray, but I pray their's a hood in heaven  
Fake brother's claim their's no shame in they're game  
You know my name, show me a real nigga wit a brain

"The ladies will kick it the rhyme that is wicked  
Those that don't know how to be pros get evicted  
A woman can bear you break you take you  
Now it's time to rhyme can you relate to  
A sister dope enough to make you holler and scream  
  
Ayo let me take it from here Queen  
Excuse me but I think I'm about do  
To get into precisely what I am about to do  
I'm conversating to the folks that have no whatsoever clue  
So listen very carefully as I break it down for you  
Merrily merrily merrily merrily hyper happy overjoyed  
Pleased with all the beats and rhymes my sisters have employed  
Slick and smooth throwing down the sound totally a yes  
Let me state the position: Ladies first, yes? (Yes)  
  
(Yeah, there's going to be some changes in here)  
  
Believe me when I say being a woman is great, you see  
I know all the fellas out there will agree with me  
Not for being one but for being with one  
Because when it's time for loving it's the woman that gets some  
Strong, stepping, strutting, moving on  
Rhyming, cutting, and not forgetting  
We are the ones that give birth  
To the new generation of prophets because it's Ladies First  
  
I break into a lyrical freestyle  
Grab the mic, look into the crowd and see smiles  
Cause they see a woman standing up on her own two  
Sloppy slouching is something I won't do  
Some think that we can't flow (can't flow)  
Stereotypes, they got to go (got to go)  
I'm a mess around and flip the scene into reverse  
(With what?) With a little touch of ""Ladies First""  
  
Who said the ladies couldn't make it, you must be blind  
If you don't believe, well here, listen to this rhyme  
Ladies first, there's no time to rehearse  
I'm divine and my mind expands throughout the universe  
A female rapper with the message to send the  
Queen Latifah is a perfect specimen  
  
My sister, can I get some?  
  
Sure, Monie Love, grab the mic and get dumb  
  
Yo, praise me not for simply being what I am  
Born in L-O-N-D-O-N and sound American  
You dig exactly where I'm coming from  
You want righteous rhyming, Imma give you some  
To enable you to aid yourself and get paid  
And the material that has no meaning I wish to slay  
Pay me every bit of your attention  
Like mother, like daughter, I would also like to mention  
I wish for you to bring me to, bring me to the rhythm  
Of which is now systematically given  
Desperately stressing I'm the daughter of a sister  
Who's the mother of a brother who's the brother of another  
Plus one more, all four  
Have a job to do, we doing it  
Respect due, to the mother who's the root of it  
And next up is me, the M-O-N-I-E L-O-V-E  
And I'm first cause I'm a L-A-D-I-E  
  
Contact and in fact, the style, it gets harder  
Cooling on the scene with my European partner  
Laying down track after track, waiting for the climax  
When I get there, that's when I tax  
The next man, or the next woman  
It doesn't make a difference, keep the competition coming  
And I'll recite the chapter in verse  
The title of this recital is ""Ladies First""

"Alright listen, I'm back again cause that's what you required of  
Me steady rhyming, and I'm so sick and tired of  
Being forced to put suckers in their place  
You make me mad enough to punch you in the face  
But I'm not trying, so never sound like I don't bone to pick with you  
Show and prove that you can stand on your own two  
I speak the poetry, dissing those who keep on quoting me  
Try to play me, cease it, you don't know me  
So smile in my face, behind my back take a line or two  
I'm not an idiot, so who you think you lying to?  
Queen Latifah's here to lay the law down  
So speed it up or shake it around because it's a showdown  
The 45 King is arising, surprising, hypnotising star, he's up to par  
So I hope you've prepared yourself for what you're in for  
This is Latifah's Law  
BMW's and gold rope chains don't impress me  
Or get you closer to the point you can undress me  
Get skeezed, you nose will bleed, that's how they live life  
Prepare to feel the wrath of the giver of all life  
Fire and desire make you go a little higher  
When I grab the wire of the mic  
And get hype, I'm sorry you sound dot  
Cause I roll like the homicide squad  
You must be broke and, hoping that I'm soft but I'm dope and  
Left you in the litter to consider coping with  
Life, it's trife yeah, but these things happen  
You need to make it better, stop trying to be the mack again  
Get a grip on the African way  
Cause there's a sucker born every day  
Crime's the way for you to see what the Queen saw  
And this is Latifah's law  
Now DJ Mark made up a beat that he can bring you  
And I of course supply the rhyme that you can swing to  
The Flavor Unit keeps all, and keeps a way to band  
And slides keep the hardcore fall, cause I'm heavy-handed  
Whip out a .45 caliber pen and begin  
A funky message from beginning to end  
Peace be to Africa, can't forget my other land  
Won't fulfill my heart unless I speak about the motherland  
You say you're living right, but we know it's nonsense  
In case you forgot, just check your conscience  
At showtime, I blow lines, you don't get yours, I get mine  
Your showtimes, you behind, the Queen Latifah divine  
Rule number one: don't step across the line that I drew  
Number two: don't take credit for something that you didn't do  
Number three: check your heart, every man has a call  
It's time for me to go, but I'll be back, y'all

"I used to visit all the very gay places  
Those come what may places  
Where one relaxes on the axis of the wheel of life  
To get the feel of life  
From jazz and cocktails.  
  
The girls I knew had sad and sullen gray faces  
With distant gay traces  
That used to be there you could see where they'd been washed away  
By too many through the day  
Twelve o'clock tales.  
  
Then you came along with your siren of song  
To tempt me to madness!  
I thought for a while that your poignant smile was tinged with the sadness  
Of a great love for me.  
  
Ah yes! I was wrong  
Again,  
I was wrong.  
  
Life is lonely again,  
And only last year everything seemed so sure.  
Now life is awful again,  
A trough full of hearts could only be a bore.  
A week in Paris will ease the bite of it,  
All I care is to smile in spite of it.  
  
I'll forget you, I will  
While yet you are still burning inside my brain.  
Romance is mush,  
Stifling those who strive.  
I'll live a lush life in some small dive  
And there I'll be, while I rot  
With the rest of those whose lives are lonely, too..

There I go talking out of my head again, oh baby  
Won't you come and put our two hearts together?

For me', they tried to turn me 'inside out'

So play that beat, play it, kick it, watch me  
Flip it, with dope lyrics, you want to hear it?  
Observe my ways and actions, I grab the mic  
And draw attractions  
To the table, I'm a hit you at all angles  
Those who think I caught a fit, I strangled them  
The result with a pen and a pad  
Gets mean, see I'm the Queen of Royal Badness  
I can't wait until the party is jam-packed  
When I start to drop it, the people say ""Damn, black""  
The queen is hyped up, awesome and deadly  
If you don't dance, grab a chair and plex, be  
Composure's kept, blows are thrown in death, hard as hell  
Guard as well as you can or step  
Off the premisis, in one minute it's  
Going to explode in a style that's limitless  
Make your first move, don't let it be your worst move  
Cause if you do, you'll be a hurt fool  
Keep your mouth shut to those that shout and cuss  
It's no doubt that I got clout and I'll bust  
Literature that flows like liquid  
Some can't comprehend the way I kicked it  
So don't say nothing  
Just listen up, follow instructions  
Rhyme, shake, slide, and dance like Lat said  
When I'm on stage I sold rage and drop heads  
Ambidextrous, skilled with both hands  
Teaching a lesson, ready to throw jams  
Latifah loves to rip up the scenery  
It's nothing special, just a Queen to me  
So do the knowledge, see if you can catch this  
You know what I mean, it's the Queen of Royal Badness

We will live eternally in this mood of reverie

Yes he was  
Word up, the type you have on a plate  
Cause I only met him last night  
So I don't really know him, but I hope it goes right  
So he pulls up at my door in a twenty-four foot limo  
What is on his (something), are we expecting more?  
He showered me with gifts and then he kissed me on my hand  
Now what was in your plan?  
I really didn't understand

Either you're trying to impress me or watch you're trying to get the poony

We can sit alone in a room and deal  
We can take a ride listening to music and chill  
And I can do the crazy things I never thought I'd do  
And maybe I can do all of those crazy things with you  
Cause you ain't gotta be no superstar honey  
All I wanna find out is exactly who you are  
Money ain't gone make me love ya  
And even with your car  
So cease with that attitude  
With that attitude you won't be getting far

"My mellow Latee was kicking flavor  
The R.E. posse said ""Yo Latifah we can do this""  
So I paused in the thought and in my brillance I caught  
And I agreed because I already knew this  
Now you should want to flex, cause I'm in full effect  
Queen Latifah is five-oh on this set  
You've been begging and dying for somebody's rhyming to set you free  
For God so loved the world he gave to me  
I'm coolin teaching those needing schoolin  
The mic, this mic in my hand, I'm rulin  
So prepare your mind for my lifeline  
And meet the new Queen of Royal Badness  
Latifah has the spirit so head for the water  
And dive into the wrath of my madness  
(Latifah: rasta chorus)  
Cost of living getting higher cause them to rhyme our way  
Queen Latifah getting higher cause her to rhyme our way  
Some MC's have gold and African vein  
And using each other to compete with  
Their subjects I pity because their rhymes are not witty like mine  
To write a rhyme so delicious you can eat it  
There are those who like my taste, but don't consider biting  
There's penalties for those who don't do writing, just be reciting  
Everyone else's word that took a lot of thinking  
It's not my fault your thoughts are shrinking  
while mine are growing, yes you know like all the woman inside of me  
Despite what you do or say, and even in spite of me  
Brothers, catch my eye with little hijinks like eye winks  
Dying to have a lover of my likeness  
So release all your shyness, call me ""Your highness""  
And dare to feel the wrath of my madness

Cost of living getting higher cause them to rhyme our way  
Queen Latifah getting higher cause her to rhyme our way  
Word of mouth is always everlasting  
And everlasting are the words that I bring  
The ruler of the ring is Lord Ramsey  
And music is made by Mark the 45 King  
You tremble for my treble, you're begging for the bass  
The voice is too vicious, the same as the pace  
The crowds, they love me, they give only hugs  
The shrinked-to-fit buttonflies fit quite snug  
As a bug, you know why? Because I'm bugging  
Of the beats that DJ Mark is loving  
So plex on the sounds that I'm pumping  
I'm jumping with the energy to turn your mind to gladness  
Come on, just get into it, don't lie and say you've been through it  
Feel the wrath of my madness  
(More rasta singing)  
I scene is mine cause I took it  
I took it for the money and I took it for the fun  
Don't step up in my face, you don't want to feel the taste  
Don't try and play me out, cause I am not the one  
Brothers on my brastrap, sisters clocking my sound, why?  
Because they want to be down with the  
Queen L-A-T-I-F-A-H in command  
I supply the concept for you to understand  
For those who want to bite, don't make me have to fuss  
The only thing you get is the gluteous maximus  
Suckers on the tip, you're loving me, you're leaving me  
You wish that one day you could have this  
Come on, you know the time, just be thankful for the rhyme  
And get up on the wrath of my madness

Then I suggest you rearrange  
  
'Cause change gone come  
And it ain't waitin' on no one  
They got me plottin' from the bottom  
With the ??? ain't no stopin'  
  
And all I want for Christmas is forty city hoppin'  
Is the to much to ask fo', oh no  
And I heard through the East side you spend to get some dough  
So when you get your funk, go take to the store  
  
Take it to daddy rap cause he's a professional  
Guaranteed to get your shit up off the floor  
Beach city rider you know, for sure  
You see that what flossin' is all about  
  
The tightest rider gone turn it out  
Bouncin', swirving and looking cute  
Dogg Pound out the moon, Johnny longing for soup  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Everybody in my family is nervous and waitin'  
How can I be patience?  
Look at what I'm facin'  
They ain't the ones that gonna be riding to the station  
  
So it what it all boils down to just some inspiration  
Interpretation, the conversation you had with the judge  
Of all judges budge this  
And put it in perspective all praises due, true  
  
We are living in a world  
Where anything can go at anytime  
And if you ain't up on the game  
Then I suggest you rearrange  
  
'Cause change gone come  
And it ain't waitin' on no one  
For all the drama I done went through  
To get this to ya  
  
How do I think I was gone do ya  
Have you been mislead, since I asked you all to creep with me  
You coulndn't be cause ever since its been DP  
LB-B.S chronic in my chest  
  
Deathrow doggystyle holding down the west  
With a shot of what gangstas drink  
And a took off for a choke off, the most kept my G's off a toast  
And keep LBC singing y'all, DP ginging y'all  
  
We and y'all face it all  
Times living it up  
Snoop Dogg again and you know I'm just giving it up  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
When Doggy Dogg comes  
You better answer (you better answer) [Repeat: x15]

"It's a cold game  
I ain't been one to  
Jump in and out of the range  
Maybe an old school cynical  
Spinning the vision from which I paint  
You got to do it you can  
Gotta keep rhyming  
East side high enjoying life  
Hair blowing in the wind  
Distinctive of me is gangster bliss  
  
This is what you're calling a cyst  
Pass the morph quick  
Memories missed  
I made a lot of friends  
A whole lot of money  
Been down a couple times  
But it never stopped my rhyming  
In fact I got better  
Clutching on Berettas, blowing their sticky  
Turn it to weather  
Award shows, endo, free load bodes  
This is how a player roll  
  
And I will never be questioned  
By some new young chump popping their tongue  
Snoopy D made the way for you to walk  
O in to The Almighty  
Without you it couldn't be done  
You praise with the rise of the sun, you did  
Hold close in my hands from my throne  
And I never be crucified  
Within my own zone  
Here for a very good reason to show love  
But you gotta separate grown man from grown thug  
From almost going down for murder in '93  
To kids all over the city bowling the Snoop's league  
  
I changed, a lot smarter, I got a daughter  
Two sons, beautiful wife, for starters  
I did it all Jack  
Popping these P's even in the national cuisine overseas yeah  
Don't judge me you only knew Snoopy  
You never tried to know Calvin you tried to group me, yo  
Like some loco I earned my respect  
Yeah so much for the coast I should get a check  
But all in all I did it B  
Cool as a blind with a C  
Loving my life as I push away the groupies  
Snooping in a coup and you can call uncle Snoopy  
  
Don't worry about your circumstances  
Take your chances  
Still from the L B C  
For you are the C  
Holler at your uncle Snoopy  
Holler at your uncle Snoopy  
I paid my dues and now it's time to make a change  
Gotta make that move  
There is a time and place for everything  
I paid my dues and now it's time to make a change  
  
Gotta make that move  
There is a time and place for everything  
I paid my dues and now it's time to make a change

Those Hollywood nights  
They drive me crazy  
  
[Snoop Dogg]  
Huh, it's like that that there  
They love it when I let down my hair  
From Jessica Alba to Jessica Simpson  
Even Jessica Biel wanna know how I feel  
So I let 'em all come to my back table  
Roll up and lick the paper if they able  
Bottles of everything, models and everything  
Everything goes and yes I mean everything  
Cocaine castles, I ain't sniffin'  
But baby that plate in that one movie is trippin'  
So, I invite her over to my party  
Blonde hair, long legs, a real live Barbie  
No autographs, I ain't signin' now  
Act like you been around a boss, bitch settle down  
My life is like one big highlight  
Welcome to the motherfuckin' Hollywood night life  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
[Snoop Dogg]  
Every night I'm in the limo, Excursion  
With some whites, some asians and persians  
They flirtin', and I'm certain they suckin'  
One night with the Dogg and it's curtains  
She say she wanna be an actress  
So I pointed to these nuts and then I yelled action!  
Take one, take two, now cut  
Now turn around, and let the homie Damani fuck  
Huh, yeah, here we go again  
I gotta go behind the club just to get in  
They say I'm just too much commotion  
All the yellin' and screamin' and pushin', oh yes I got 'em open  
I'm in the back of the club gettin' a backrub  
Smokin' with one of the Marley's, ""One Love""  
I'm higher than gas, refusin' to pass  
Hollywood Night School my nigga join my class, c'mon  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
[Snoop Dogg]  
Meet me at the Roosevelt, bass cabana room  
I'm on Sunset (where you at?) at The House of Blues  
I just stepped in for a quick cameo  
Me and Leonardo DiCaprio  
He keep a bad hoe, I keep a bad hoe  
He slide me new hoes everywhere we go  
Oh the life, night after night, flight after flight  
Yes, these Hollywood nights  
Will have a nigga burnt out, some hoes turned out  
You know it's pimpin' when you see the Dogg permed out  
Cameras flashin', police passin'  
Every little model wanna give me some action  
So I let 'em kick it, then I let 'em lick it  
Get some menage, durin' every visit  
I wouldn't leave it, even if they paid me  
The L.B. raised me and Hollywood is crazy

"We'd like to welcome y'all to the fabulous Carolina West  
I own this motherfucker and my name is Taa-Dow

Put your hands together for Snoop Doggy Dogg  
The Dogg Pound, and the fabulous Dramatics

It's like everywhere I look, and everywhere I go  
I'm hearing motherfuckers trying to steal my flow  
But it ain't no thing cause see my nigga Coolio  
Put me up on the game when I step through the do'  
Ya know, some of these niggas is so deceptive  
Using my styles like a contraceptive  
I hope ya get burnt, it seems ya haven't learnt  
It's the nick nack patty wack, I still got the bigger sack  
So put your gun away, run away, 'cause I'm back (why?)  
Hit em up, get em up, spit em up, now  
Tell me what's going on  
It make me want to holler, 'cause my dollars come in ozones  
Lone for the break-up, so take off your clothes  
And quit trying to spit at my motherfucking hoes  
Seaking of hoes, I'll get to the point  
You think you got the bomb 'cause I rolled you a joint  
You'se a flea and I'm the big Dogg  
I'll scratch you off my balls with my motherfucking paws  
Y'alls, niggas, better recognize  
And see where I'm coming from it's still East Side till I die  
Why ask why? As the world keeps spinning to the D-O-Double-G-why

Well if you give me ten bitches then I'll fuck all ten  
See my homey Snoop Doggy sipping juice and gin  
Don't slip, I'm fo' to set trip, to get papers  
Styles vary, packing flavor like Life Savors  
Ain't that something, talk shit and I'm dumping  
I had your whole fucking block bumping  
Don't sweat, but check the technique, I'm unique like China  
Ya never find the bomb-a-rama then this Nigga behind ya  
So peek-a-boo, clear the way, I'm coming through  
One-two, three, you can't see me  
I'm a G like that strapped with hit hard tactics  
A fucking menace, using hoes like tennis rackets  
It's on again, it's on and popping  
All I see is green, so there ain't no stopping  
I want to see some panties dropping  
I'm coming from L.A., she used to chill with Dre up in Compton  
(All I ever did was just use that hoe  
Show her my dickies, get with these, and kick flows)  
I'm dishing out blues, I'm upsetting like bad news  
Cut off khakis, french braids, and house shoes  
Kurupt, the name's often marked for catching slugs  
And I smoke weed for the fuck of it  
Ruff and rugged shit, it's unexplanitory how I gets wicked  
But it's mandatory that I kick it  
Check it, I'm runnin hoes in 94, now must I prove it  
Hoes call me Sugar Ray for the way I be sticking and moving  
Prepare for a war, it's on, I'm head hunting  
Hit the button, and light shit up like Red Dawn  
Peep, the massacre from a verbal assassin  
Murdering with rhymes packing Tec-9's for some action  
You really don't know, do you, you fucking with a hog  
You can't do me, I'm going out looney like O-Dog

Tha Dogg Pound rocks the party (all night long)  
Tell when (till the early morn)  
It don't stop (and uh) it don't quit (for the)  
The Dogg Pound clique (to drop the cavvy Dogg shit)  
  
Diggity Daz out of the motherfucking cut once mo'  
So grab a seat and grab your gin and juice and check out the flow  
I flip flop and serve hoes with a fat dick  
Till I die I'm still screaming that (bitches ain't shit)  
Now I'm the mack daddy, had he, not known about  
The city where I'm from, dumb diddy dumb  
As you groove to the gangster shit  
The D-O-Double-G the P-O-you-N-D, the gangsta clique  
Now as the Pound break it down with the gangsta funk  
I can see and I can tell that's what the fuck you want  
So I blaze up the chronic, so I can get high  
I promise I'll smoke chronic till the day that I die

Fuck all my enemies, and chasing cheese with cheese

Biggie was too large and Tupac was too real  
Niggas had homies with heat on the street and he got killed  
How the fuck did that happen I thought y'all niggas was rapping

Besides drive bys and kidnapping  
Shit when u head up out the door foget the four four  
Never leave home with out it

Let me guess, you prefer to wear cotton  
I can tell, cause you like squatting  
Your last dude, he was so rotten  
And now your love is to be gotten  
Yeah baby girl I can read your mind  
But what I'm really trying to do is ready between your pantylines  
I know it seems oh so personal  
But I'm just trying to make you feel real comfortable  
I know, so, what will it be?  
And the type of underwear you wear I mean it's troubling me

Hiding it, should be dividing it  
It's real tight now but I got a way to widen it  
And slide in it, real smooth like  
with a little bit of Miles Davis to get you in the mood like  
zoom boom hit the poom-poom right  
Just to get your groove right  
I can make it happen, but it can't happen if you ain't good at it  
When you goin' let a nigga have a look at it?  
Calling all cars, yeah baby girl you a star

Foaming at the mouth and wagging his tail  
Searching through the yards with a keen sense of smell  
Looking for the business in heat

We travel in packs and we do it from the back  
How else can you get to the booty?  
We do it Doggystyle, all the while we do it Doggystyle  
Yo motherfucking hoes  
He fucked the fleas off a bitch  
He shacked the ticks off his dick  
And in the booty, he buries his motherfucking bone  
And if there's any left over  
He'll roll over and take a doggy bag home

Keep the party cracking, while I'm steady rapping  
This game we run, y'all know what's happening  
We back in effect, we got the heat on deck  
I'm sliding down South with a blunt in my mouth  
I catch a plane out East and try to make some peace  
I'm hanging with my niggas in the projects  
The homie's throwing a party, I gotta get back West  
Oh yeah, that's right, we are the best  
No Limit DPG Southwest connects, ya feel me?

Pack my flag, wear khakis with that extra sag  
Mad dog in every last motherfucker I pass  
Never ask would I mash with the tray on my neck  
And my status been a classic I stay on the set  
Let it rain, let it drip, turn the change to chips  
Never nervous, stay in service from this gangsta shit  
Cool time on the grind never mind the danger

So fluid wit' your technique, y'all niggas gon' respect me,  
Man, I been doin' dis' shit before I even learned how to crawl though,  
Gettin' interviewed by motherfuckers like geraldo,  
And niggas wanna know if I smoke newports or marlboros?  
Man, I'm fuckin' wit' dat real shit, nigga can you feel dis'?  
I make that shit for the realest of millions,  
While I'm wheelin' and dealin' and feelin the feelin',  
And oh what a relief it is,  
That snoop is back in dis motherfucker handlin' his biz,  
Takin' care of his kids and makin' hits, oh shit,  
There it is again, you never know if your career might flop, fizz  
So, stay on your toes and keep a pair wit'cha foes,  
And keep a set of new hoes and floatin' and tie da bow,  
Fuck these niggaz and peep out whitey ro,

Bitch I ain't lookin' for none, you might got kids for cause, or down wit' bud  
Pushin' them dubs, look here cause,  
Lemme tell you how it's goin' be  
If I was broke loc, these bitches wouldn't want me  
I'm tellin' you the good-god truth, you want proof?  
Ask them hoes over there, ""y'all wanna fuck snoop?"" (yeah!)  
We'll take the money and the game away,  
I bet they won't say the same that day,  
But it's okay, cause I don't trip,  
Cause ""bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks"",

From the solar, cause this, is it,  
Can ya dig it? (i can dig it!)  
Jelly roll pulled a rabbit out his hat,  
I pull a strap out my motherfucking back, cause I know it's like dat,  
I'm in a meetin' wit' these white folks talkin' bread,  
They want a contract on a nigga till' I'm dead,  
If I don't sign they gon' turn me over to the feds,  
They struck me out, now I'm pinch-hittin' for the reds,  
But I'm a dodger blue, so I gotta keep it true,  
I gotta home-run, nigga we long gone,  
I'm realizin', justizin', visualizin',  
Rip-ridin', put mines in,  
Takin' this game to the next level,  
Trustin' no one, especially them red devils,  
Keep ya head level, hand on my get-up,  
Stay on the red-up, pimpin' ain't easy, but there's a whole lot of fed-up,  
And like I told you from the get-go, don't trust no one (no one, no one),  
And like I told you from the gettin', don't trust no one

Time and time again, I'ma spit this rhyme again  
She the queen in my life, and I'ma make sure she gon' shine again  
She taught me everything, but she didn't charge a fee  
She taught me everything, except how to see a G  
For the nine months you carried, I hope you bury me  
instead of the other way around, and I put that on Dogg Pound  
I made you cry, you made me smile  
I just want to say I love you for life

Pinkie rings and things that come with my wonderful job  
Dog pound niggas, and we came to fight  
I was several million up before it came to light  
Now they callin' me the truest one to ever do it  
Status symbol for the pimps, now enjoy the music  
Smoked out like a player and you know the name  
Break a bitch quick, really, biggest in the game

Yeah, this shit right here sound like a love song

A gangsta love song, you feel me? Check it out  
(she was in love, with a THUG, in love!)  
(she was in love, with a THUG, in love!)  
  
Yeah, gangsta, uh-huh!  
Have you ever had a pretty, young saditty  
Black female with chips, from the city?  
Her momma got ends, and her daddy got ends  
And she liked to give me ends when I'm out with my friends  
Good girl, why do good girls like bad boys? (I don't know)  
When I was a kid, growing up, I never had toys  
And I think that she can figure that shit out (why?)  
Cause every time she came to pick a nigga up  
Shit, she'd take a nigga out  
Roll around town, ask the pound, they know, look  
Baby was my thing, nah, she was my low-low  
Bought my first Rolo, and then we took a photo together  
Man I hope this thing last forever  
We been together six months, and we ain't argued yet  
She loving a nigga, steady buying me shit  
And don't say shit when I dip with my click  
And understand, when I'm down and out  
May need some help with some chips  
Her mother approved of me, but her father he don't  
He probably won't, shit Pops ain't no punk  
Daddy's little girl be in a gangsta's world  
Buying me house shoes and khaki blues, California curls  
No matter what her father say, baby gon' see me  
It's like a jungle sometimes, that makes me Wonder like Stevie  
Believe me, when I say that baby was in love with a thug  
In love with a thug  
  
[Chorus: x2]

But I'ma write you every night and call you on the phone too  
What you gon' do? ""You know I'm goin' stay true  
But I'ma go ahead to college like my father want me to""  
Well um, off to my cell with ya body on my mind  
And I'ma call you back tomorrow round the same time  
I'm on the mainline, 9500 for short  
On another phone line, holla'n at my other hoe  
This bitch ain't saying shit, cause the bitch ain't shit  
Old fat gold-digging-ass county check receiving bitch  
I bail up in the Day Room and get in a scrap  
Niggas watching Soul Train and I wouldn't turn it back (man fuck y'all)  
Never caught slipping, always on strap  
And now I'm back in the hole with no motherfucking getback  
Sit back and contemplate, and think about baby  
And hope she don't get caught up in the world that's so crazy  
But while I'm up in Wayside, and she off in college  
She getting a little mo' than a schoolgirl knowledge  
Cause gangsta-ass niggas go to school nowadays  
I tried to make you wait, but I can't change yo' ways  
She fell in love with the local G  
And now they both in the penitentiary, she didn't mention me

Before a nigga even knock  
The game is here to stay?

Dead in his tracks, from a full six pack.

Just a young nigga on the front of a swing  
Playing football up in Powly High

Homicides didn't happen much, niggas wasn't rapping much  
It's 99 nigga, shit, I know you strapping up

I guess it's true, you can't take the hood out a homeboy  
Plus, my hood just lost another homeboy  
Another one got life, and we don't know, if he coming home boy  
They in the street tell me ""just leave it alone boy,  
Let them do them take care of your own boy""  
But I said back brake a bound, before I was grown boy  
You had dreams of being a dope boy  
Yeah, I was runnin' from the po po  
Banging for the turf, late night huntin'  
Puttin' me in work, good day comin', airbrush, shirt,  
Pay day, get the spot, got my hair cut first  
Made mom sick when I wouldn't go to church  
Yeah I live in the burbs, but I think 21st  
I know since I left that it's gotten much worse  
But I'd still be there, if I couldn't write a verse

To the the blocks that raise me, the enemies and the homies that made me,  
Tough enough to hang on the corners that would mold me  
Critics wonder if I'm tryna be the old me,  
But if the thing the old me ever left, then they don't really know me,  
And don't know, we don't change, we just become OG, you always addicted  
To the life, you just don't OD, I don't owe shit to the streets before they
owe me  
Took me in when my moma didn't want me, to wild to be a child, and pops  
Not around now, all I got now is the homies, to teach me, how to be a man  
In what not, how to brake ounces in the grams and what not  
The reason I'm so nice with my hands and what not shit, you think I forgot,
man  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Verse 3]  
Thank good every day that the boy could spit  
And all around the world they enjoyin' my shit  
I know I got plenty more wars to get  
I got a, beautiful wife and some gorgeous kids  
But it wouldn't be right if I ignore the shit  
They made me how I am, the music in the man  
Told me that I can for the world gave a damn  
If it wasn't for my shit, they sayin' stick to the plan  
Probably be a gun instead of a pen in my hand  
Probably be doin' a dub and the pen with my man  
The say leaders streets but they don't really understand  
All I had was the block, when I didn't have fans  
Wrapped on the corners when I couldn't get spins  
All I had was the homies when I didn't have kids  
If it all come down and my career was to end, I'm sure my name  
Would live... In the streets

10-20-71, the day I come out  
Two days later, I'm running my mouth  
Mom's put a bottle to my grill  
I look her in the face and I say chill  
So she puts her back up on a pillow, uh huh  
Two minutes later I'm bailin' out the hos-pital  
On my way to the liquor store  
First thing I grab is some skins and a 4-0  
Dropped the O-E cause it's just too cold  
Get myself some gin instead and then I stroll  
But before I get out the door  
The man behind the counter says hey, yo, yo  
He picks me up and sit me on the seat  
And then he get the phone and get to dialin' the police  
I'm on the run but I can't walk yet  
Can't grapple nothin' said, cause I can't talk yet  
First trip in the police car  
Cameras all around me as if I was a star  
Mom's grabbed me, hugged me, and kissed me  
This fool tried to twist me, mom's say she missed me (I missed you)  
Re-group it, swoopin' in the coupe and  
That's what I'ma name you cause boy you be snoopin'  
Soon to be hoopin' hoes I be scoopin'  
First piece of ass before I got my first whoopin'  
Cookin', bookin', hookin' up with G's  
Twenty days later I'm from are-T-see  
Doin' it up, rollin', givin' it up  
Sellin' candy for a white boy outta light blue truck  
And I'm comin' up, that's right, niggas runnin' up  
Havin' fun and stuff  
You niggas don't want none of us  
  
[Snoop Dogg]  
What's up homie (What's up 'cause, where you from)  
My name Snoop Dogg (Where you from though)  
Eastside, rollin' twenty crip (What)  
(Oh) yeah (OK, it's all good cuz) That's what I'm talkin' bout  
(Yeah) Ah, you gonna feel me nigga, sooner or later  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Snoop Dogg]  
Roll with me, S-N-double O-P  
Mel-man where ya been O.G.  
Tell me, the game'll never fail me  
Ask J or my lil' homie Shelby  
Uh, I cut em' up like Marcus Welby  
This is the dopest G, that you will ever see  
There'll never be, another me  
By the grace of God, ya lovin' me  
Pause, do it to em' dogg  
Now drop a rock em' dogg  
Now put a lock em' dogg  
Rollin' down the river spinnin' on a log  
Jog to the liquor store, grab me a thicker ho  
Get me a Michelob, now I want to Snicker though  
Remind me of the old days  
When my mama used to bang the O'Jays  
Family reunion, ha ha, hey 8-track style  
Mel-Man you a fool for this 'cause  
Cause I'm the motherfucking dogg, named Snoop

How you feelin'? I'm up to dealin', ridin' like a villan

We got's ta get paid (Makin' money all ya'll)  
I mean I steps to tha stage in my G-boy stance  
And say a few rhymes to make your girl want to dance  
  
I'm so fly like a dove  
I come from up above  
You trippin' on your girl cause she showed me love  
Nigga don't beat em, cause if you beat em, you don't need em  
  
You lay your hands on me, watch how fast I take your freedom  
I delete em, but don't mistreat em  
I stay up on em, and that's one ta grow on,  
Let me flow on  
  
You can rock to tha rythme you see  
or you can rock to tha rythme of me  
Just remember when you do your thang,  
Make sure you do your thang on a hang  
  
And everythang, is everythang  
There ain't no mo' than this paper chase  
Like them white-boy DA's was on tha case  
You know I ain't tryin' ta floss, but uh,  
(Murder, murder, murder) was the case that they lost  
I'm Tha DoggFather  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now, do anybody in tha house remember  
When there wasn't no Snoop Dogg? (Hell yeah!)  
There wasn't no rappers hollin' 'bout LBC  
Am I trippin' ya'll? (Hell no!)  
  
Now, when I grow up, I want to be like Snoop  
Have prestigious women  
That's the truth from the beginning  
In and out of the flyest hotels  
  
You say your family don't know me  
Hold on hommie, that's foremost and promos  
Sales, tails, scales and jails  
Success before death  
  
No one in my clique fails  
As females with the almighty Father lead  
Succeedin' ta give my peep's just what they need  
And it ain't no party like this kind,  
  
'Cause you can leave your worries behizzind  
But I'ma git back to tha grizzind

Come and go with me to Doggyland!  
To a place that be, call it LBC  
  
Now if you tired of the hard work  
Tears and sweat  
And you breakin' your neck  
And you still up in debt.  
Walkin' round town all strapped in,  
Niggas be havin' more bad times than Captain Rat did.  
Two strikes none left, out of breath  
Livin' in the city it's a jungle yo.  
All this deception on top of stress,  
You havin' more problems than a algebra test.  
You can't seem to come up, wit yo' money for rent,  
And now yo' baby momma trippin' she want fifty percent.  
It's a thin line, between yours and mine  
The difference is you gotta scratch to a get nickel and dime.  
Now I know a place where  
Ya' might wanna be and I can take you there  
Pop goes the nine, We'll go right behind  
You can slide off your shoes sit back and recline.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh your homies think you're funny?  
Doin' stick ups for moneys  
Just to impress the honeys (This is for the honeys)  
Got yo' rocks, so you keep'em in the sack,  
You got two strikes, but you right back up to bat.  
You all about yo' money and got something to sell  
But if you bail for a robber you'll be back in the jail cell.  
You chillin' with yo' feet up  
Someone hated but baby without the homies and  
That's when you got beat up.  
Because you can't be out there doin' low  
And then right gather up yo' crew and roll.  
Ain't no rules when you out there doin' dirt,  
Somebody's always layin' in the cut to get ya' hurt.  
But see, I know a place where  
You might wanna be  
And I can take you there  
Pop goes the nine, We'll go right behind  
You can slide off your shoes sit back and recline.

Here ye, Here ye, come one, come all.  
To a place that be, call it LBC.

Lemme holla to a little home boy real quick,  
Know what I'm sayin'?  
Cause he travelin' in the fast lane.  
  
Stop the life it seem that we are on,  
Time to slow your roll,  
Let Doggyland be your new home,  
Stop the life it seem that we are on,  
Time to slow your roll,  
Let Doggyland be your new home.  
  
Doggyland is the town where it's goin' diz-owne  
(It's goin' down)  
Everything is free,  
And ain't no HIV. (What?)  
And niggas don't kill one another  
(Oh really why is that?)  
Because a brother is a brother.  
(And what about the mothers?)  
They queens,  
Righteous,  
Man,  
Heaven must be like this,  
Green aroma like the grass in the summertime.  
Ain't no penitentiaries and ain't nobody doin' time.  
And oh yeah, I'm the big O-K'er,  
I'm smarter than the senator,  
Bigger than the mayor.  
Heaven on Earth  
It's like a prayer.  
And you can't get in without yo' gold card you got  
To be a player.  
Now you know a place where  
You gots to be and I took you there,  
Pop goes the nine, we'll go right behind  
You can slide off your shoes sit back and recline.

"Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, Quik check this out dog  
You know motherfuckers be doing way way too motherfucking much  
You know? That's real

Now if that nigga next to you got a rented car  
And he acting like it's his but you know it's not  
Say he doing too much, yeah nigga you doing too much  
And if that stuck-up bitch got the bar posted-up  
She acting like that hair's hers but you know what's up  
Say she doing too much, yeah baby you doing too much  
  
I gave my kinfolk the keys to my Suburb  
I told em ""Hit the side and slide and get the herb""  
But guess who's calling, Pipedream Patty  
Made that nigga park my who ride beside the alley  
Forget about that nigga though (fuck that nigga)  
Fuck that nigga yo  
But I can't forget about him cause he taught me everything I know  
Oh no Joe, walking down the wrong lane  
Tooting on that cocaine, fucking wit that wrong thing  
Niggas like that (what), get things like they want it (damn)  
Then fake the funk, doggonnit  
Now loc, look at this predicament  
You smoked out and can't be trusted, I can't kick it wit  
Niggas like you, used to be in my crew  
Goddamn, they don't make niggas like they used to  
I remember Marley Marl and the Juice Crew  
That's probably why I keep a tight grip on my deuce-deuce  
  
Now if you're doing for your family and you can't stand it  
Cause you know these motherfuckers trying take advantage  
Say they doing too much, yeah nigga you doing too much  
And if your kinfolk broke and he smoke dope  
And he need to catch a motherfucking different stroke  
Say he doing too much, yeah Joey you doing too much  
  
We parlay, parlay everyday DPG style  
We might throw a pool party every once in a while  
Now in fact we gon' do one this weekend  
Let's see how many hoes me and my nigga Rose can weed in  
I believe in, sharing the cock  
Also, I believe in comparing the cock  
Look, don't knock a nigga like me (why?)  
Cause she love the way I just beat up the pussy  
Not just knee deep, she was totally deep  
When she went down on me  
She blew a nigga socks off, got a nigga rocks off  
Oh wee, baby you's a freak  
Put my homey up on game like a gangsta  
But my homey fell in love and he banked her  
Ain't that a trip? Now we in a twist  
Back in the county wit the red ribbon on his wrist  
  
Now when a nigga hit his girl and she don't hit back  
And he get his third strike wit no get back  
Say he doing too much, yeah homey you doing too much  
And when the homey in the pen, doing a sin  
And his girlfriend fucking wit his best friend  
Say she doing too much, hell yeah she doing too much  
  
I'm living up in the hills, wine sipping wit mills  
I'm having major type of paper, I ain't tripping off bills (still)  
Show me some respect and accept my coolness  
And don't mistake my kindness to mean I'm foolish  
Use this as a warning, cause I'm starting  
To figure it's some niggas think I'm soft as Charmin  
Pardon me, cause I ain't mad when you get bent  
But I hate when fools mistake me for U.S. spray  
Friends and family, getting after me like repo  
Eat, smoke, choke then want me to throw em a c-note  
You doing too much when you clutching on my touch-tone  
Calling strays over nigga leading months gone  
Conversate for fo' hours, wasting mo' power  
And only get to hit a cold shower  
You faking like you're making more moves than Simpson  
But fronting, pushing buttons, doing nothing but sin  
  
And when a nigga on yo' phone, running up yo' bill  
Trying to tell some hoodrat bitch how he feel  
You know he doing too much, yeah nigga you doing too much  
And when your baby momma crying bout she need some milk  
And you heard some other nigga did been at her tilt  
You know she doing too much, yeah baby you doing too much

Hah! sicka than your average  
Money too long can't stash it  
In the closet or the mattress  
Paper, stretch like elastic  
Checks from advances, the bank can't cash it  
So the price for that, never ask it  
Just sign my name or pop plastic  
Hating ass cops wanna harrass em  
Searching for a glock in the pocket of his fashion  
Bitches wit SP stitches on they asses  
And they left breast (yes!)  
Let's get dressed and toast to the occasion  
Cops couldn't page em, flow so amazing, hot like cajun  
You fucking wit the champ

Three piece suits, linen fabrics  
Three quarter croc, sharper than a pastor  
B Sig bring the light to the masses  
Of these rap bastards, who gives street passes  
One shooting can lead to three caskets  
Jump suits, state boots, at least three stabbings  
You softer than a Reebok Classic  
Folding under pressure when confronted by them badges  
I was taught stay low and keep blasting  
Po only know questions that was answered  
Keep a number on the high price lawyer  
It's five ways now days, everybody saw ya

"These are the tales the freaky tales  
These are the tales that I tell so well  
These are the tales the freaky tales  
These are the tales that I tell so well  
  
I met this girl her name was Joan  
She loved the way I rocked on the microphone  
When I met Joan I took her home  
She was just like a doggie all on my bone  
  
I met another girl her name was Ann  
All she wanted was to freak with a man  
When I met Ann, I shook her hand  
We ended up freakin' by a garbage can  
  
The next young freak, I met was Red  
I took her to my house and she gave me head  
She like blowin' dicks, is all she said  
We jumped in the sheets and we broke my bed  
  
There's another girl, her name is Sherry  
You talk about sex and the girl acts scary  
I heard she was freakin' from my big brother Jerry  
Took her to my crib and I popped that cherry  
  
Young and tender, sweet Denise  
Get her in the bed and the girl's a beast  
I tell you homeboy if you get a piece  
She'll only start talkin' bout signin' a lease  
  
I met a young tender, her name is Lori  
An X-Rated movie wouldn't tell her story  
She had a twin sister, her name was Lisa  
And just like Lori she's a real dick pleaser  
  
My girlfriend's name, was Michelle  
Her booty was bigger than the tail on a whale  
When I freaked Michelle, I freaked her well  
Her pussy got hotter than the flames of Hell  
  
I G'd this girl, her name was Tammi  
I didn't want to do it cause the bitch was 'flantly'  
She had a best friend, her name was Janet  
I pulled her to the side and I spit that game  
  
I had a lot of freaks, in my lifespan  
I freaked one night, with this girl named Pam  
The very next day, I saw her with her man  
One week passed, and I was in her again  
  
I had an old tender, her name's Jeanine  
She was thirty-eight and I was only seventeen  
She likes to freak, she's just a fiend  
It really didn't matter when I saw her in jeans  
  
I want a big freak, fat and sloppy  
I kick on back, and watch the hoe just mop me  
Two tons of fun, Big Mad Magenta  
A country broad from Alabama  
  
I met this freak, her name was Beth  
Her pussy got wet and it smelled like death  
I was tired as Hell, I was drippin' sweat  
But I was all up in her tryin' to hold my breath  
  
Bake, and, shake, ups  
I met this freak in Vegas  
She she said her name was Don-na  
She was a ?belt? lil' freak from Chi-na  
  
I said, ""I don't pimp, or gigolo  
I'm havin' so much paper I don't need a hoe  
You can break yourself, but you can't break me  
You never met a player like Snoop baby""  
  
I knew a dick sucker named Betty Joe  
I took her to my house and we did it on the flo'  
The girl got freaky let me tell you mo'  
She was down on her knees, beggin' to blow  
  
She's like another freak, named Renee  
You get her all alone and she'll make your day  
Like Burger King, she knows the play  
and with a freak like Renee you can Have It Your Way  
  
These are the tales, the freaky tales  
These are the tales that I tell so well  
These are the tales, the freaky tales  
These are the tales that I tell so well!

Than you'll think

Keep my head up and stand tall  
If I stumble, then I'll fall  
Will you pick me up at all?  
Will you pick me up at all?  
I'm a keep it gangsta till my end

That we can call friends  
Ohhhhhhh  
  
Now all I gotta do is keep my head up  
And walk a straight line when fake friends won't mind  
But I'm kind-hearted  
And don't like being stepped on  
If I wasn't real, I wouldn't be in this position  
Like that, dogg, I got a whole lot to say  
I'm by myself with my rhymes when we kick it all day  
Lil' Jay used to say I'd never be nobody  
But you know what I never do?  
Smoke it off like Gotti  
Five million dollar hits puttin in saxophones  
Tray Deee and Snoop, we sound good on this microphone  
I never threaten nobody to make it happen  
Let me show you how we eat a full meal off this rappin'  
But if I had a chance to give it back  
I'd give it to the ones who helped me do that  
Do that, straight from the heart  
Eastside till I die  
We ain't no contract friends, we doggs for life  
  
It's a trip how we Crip  
Suppose the enemies still  
With both sides ride causing plenty of tears  
Insane's and twenties both from the same city  
A bunch of down niggas and it ain't that many  
Me, see, and the G can think back to the start  
Homies chillin', getting high, shooting craps in the park  
And having a heart  
To get 'em up if it was beef  
Head up like G's, take it out in the street  
Hold ya own was the code that I growed to view  
So I fucked with and stuck with a chosen few  
But Snoop Dogg, you can call me, whatever the case  
And homie that ain't nothing that the set could erase  
You put me with the homie, Goldie, though we never had spoke  
A Insane with a twenty, now we hell of a close  
And why'all kids, my kids, so we family now  
Cause I could never see you doing bad without  
And that's real  
  
Life is much mo' precious  
Than you'll think  
Like a game'll make yo chips sink  
It's so hard  
Hard to trust a smile and face  
When niggas got intentions already taking yo place  
Keep my head up and stand tall

And I'm still gonna fade em all  
With the gangsta shit that keeps ya hanging  
How many hoes in ninety-four will I be banging?  
Every single one, to get the job done

So drop it on the one motherfucker put together that set  
A nigga with a grip of that gangsta shit  
With the Eastside hoes on my motherfucking dick  
And the Compton niggas all about to set trip  
Swing it back, bring it back, just like this  
And if you with my shit, then blaze up another spliff  
And keep the motherfucking blunt in your pocket loc  
'cause Doggy Dogg is all about the zig zag smoke  
See it's a West coast thing, where I'm from  
And if you want some, get some, bad enough, take some  
But watch the gun by my side  
Because it represents me and the motherfucking East Side

And move and lose it trying to bite  
His fingers are ? as I ride the skills

Moe Luv is on the mix tonight, Moe Luv  
  
Ok, now Moe is on the mixer  
So get ready, cuz here's another twister  
About the way he gets the crowd to move  
And groove and dance to the things he do  
And prove the way he sway and lift and shape  
And rock hard, all night he's on and on  
Swiftly slicing, cuts are nice and smooth like rice and  
Beans, another cut rises  
Moe surprises more than one  
2, 3, 4, 5, the jam packed crowd  
Of biters and writers  
Accumulating reciters observing  
Cuts from the master as I move faster  
Pass the wack DJs

I drop styles on ears the public bite em  
Not many went to school, so the dummies wouldn't write em  
They say yo Keith, yo cool, you usin big words  
I went to college, I'm even more stupid herb  
Back on the scene to put a lesson out

[Kool Keith]  
Yeah!  
It's time to come out and give the people something they can understand  
Something not too complicated (cated)  
You know what we goin' do?  
We goin' bring it down to earth (earth)  
  
[Chorus: x4]  
Bring it down to earth, I don't understand!  
  
[Kool Keith]  
Mega bomb ignite, super reflection  
Power ignites the fourth horseman, turbo  
I kick styles like data, computer reading  
Miles away to beam star trek  
Moving my style up, optimus level 4  
I get it warp speed, youse on my space tour  
Get with the elements, eloquent spacecraft  
Change my gamma flow, one-three-eight-seven  
Twenty-oh-nine-six, cereal silver seven  
I got the skills to rap, so what you want spock?  
Style like captain kirk, gamma ray one block  
Particle leading out, rock the way intercourse  
Damaging animals, a lady with menopause  
Rising at one speed, altitude x be  
We need some gas or fuel, yo come in major!  
I'm just a level or pinch, I'm hitting new york  
Flying with ced, I see the other world  
I need some gas, yo Jim, I gotta come down  
Perimeter's reading we might crash!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Kool Keith]  
I know you out there and y'all understand  
But I'ma let Ced get on and tell y'all what it's really like  
It's not so complicated  
But connect with me and y'all follow me right on through!

Well I'm the equalizer, known to be graphic  
I clear static, breakin up traffic  
Move, while I enter the groove

to wack MC's who claim to be better than  
No way I'm frankly more clever than  
all of you, each and every one, my son  
Pay close attention  
I take your brain to another dimension  
Hold it, mold it, shape it  
You got a knife, yes I wanna scrape it  
up and down, sideways, any way I can  
be rude to you  
But I'll rap and be crude to you  
And eat up, toy ducks I beat up  
I am the oven your brains I wanna heat up  
Mega, supersonic degrees  
I come around, roastin MC's  
with fire, to burn the toy liar  
Raw meat, turn the flame higher  
Cook it, like a fish I'll hook it  
For any beat, it's time that I took it  
right, correctly to the top  
with the rhythm and as your head bop  
I'm hype, for the critical beatdown!  
  
[Ced Gee]  
I'm attacking them, my job is stacking them  
For every rapper, must I be smacking them  
once, or twice in the face  
With rough beats, producin the bass  
that blow out, cause power to go out  
Inner spark, I'm ready to blow out  
like this, altitude level  
Reachin forth, stompin every devil  
in sight, you might just wanna bite  
My illusions, mental confusions  
You're a mark, skulls I've been abusin  
Losin, any rapper who follow me  
Your girl loves me, now she wanna swallow me  
Back up, move on to the rear  
When I'm on the stage should be clear  
Speakin, goin ear to ear  
Places far, ducks would appear  
for the countdown, so you wait to rhyme  
and twist, stuttering, uttering  
Parkay, margerine, everything butter  
and another thing, you shoulda been a Muppet  
A toy boy, a fake scream puppet  
I'm takin titles, and punks better up it  
to me, Ced Gee on the mic, and I'm hype  
for the critical beatdown!  
  
[Kool Keith]  
Here's the K, combined the double-O  
Swing in the L, I'm ready to go  
as Keith, Rap General Chief Executive  
plus exquisitive  
Mandatory, capital statements  
I am the teacher, preaching what makes sense  
Class, you wasn't able to pass  
For any germ or lice who come last  
I'm boric, high computing acid  
Get off the mic and won't you please pass it  
to me, for a one-two check  
Give me a pound and lots of respect  
No hands, you dissapointing my fans  
You on reverb, and talking to cans  
Hello - how are you doing?  
I come to wreck, and parties I'll ruin  
with rhymes, pumpin up smoke  
Diesel advances makin them choke  
and cough up, the hard-headed I'll soften  
spongee, then after that drink a ?  
Roll the sess, the buddha with the ganji  
Puff up, while I make tough stuff up

"It ain't nuthin Gee, it's just a small thing (4X)  
  
Hey, I got a flow that is wicked, so sit back while I kick it  
The incredible edible, change my pitch while I rip it  
We can make it just happen, while I'm keepin' you snappin'  
Now the style is correct, so I'ma keep gangsta rappin'  
'Cause I'm back and I'm flowin', I'ma keep people knowin'  
that I'm just like the Energizer (Still going!)  
So get that and make that, somethin' you think is real fat  
It's a small thing I'm back, on the Delta Force track  
As the figure get bigger, as the soul brother nigga  
I don't plan to waste time black, I just pull the trigger  
Now my mic is just smokin', like the 'are' I'm not jokin  
Fuck around, step to me troop, your big toes is broken  
Now I be the headbanger, releasin' more anger  
'Cause my fury is deep, so don't challengers scatter  
When I'm ? the head, I make beats that just flip  
So I write up a rhyme next, then flex  
Back at the ranch with the 4-H Horsemen  
The flavor is steady, move your head to the bass  
So check the rhymes and check my stats  
And now you know, that Ced Gee is back  
I'm still the Delta

Biting and writing and fighting for this  
Beats and wax, rhymes are facts  
Biting acts

On the microphone holding my own ground  
Dominating forces  
Change the sources, punks takes losses  
Enough cause it's me on the mic  
Feeding on words, small like a nerd  
Haven't you heard this change of rhyme  
Continuing the land of time  
For my incredible, highly elevated  
Smooth in the mind, more sophisicated  
Motivated, as I relate it verbal  
Dissing a mouse and smacking any gerbel  
I bought a Saab, a 1990 Turbo  
Shining, fog lights in the front  
I'm by myself, no seats for a stunt  
'Cause I want it like that, I got it like that  
I have it like, I need it like that  
It's better like that, I made it like that  
I bought it like that, I'm living like that  
For you wack MC's  
Who go on the mic and blow on the mic  
And perpetrate frauds and making mistakes  
Like an amateur but I'm a 20 year veteran  
And better than, including the rest of them  
I chew 'em all and spit out the best of them  
One by one, I'm teaching my son  
To ease back  
Ease back

What's up, it's me again  
I'm Seth G wit a funky blend  
Of beats and rhymes on time wit my DJ  
He's not weak wit anything he plays  
Rocking, slicing, rep is treacherous  
Like a professor, he had perfected this  
Simple potion, through devotion  
Wit his blends, his motions and fastly approaching  
Coasting, reaching higher levels  
So when you see 'em, you best say hello  
I'm a take out a knife,pen and paper and write  
A rhyme so dope you can't think, can't cope  
Ducks, who are you really kidding  
You say you're dope, well you're admitting  
That you can't compete because you're rhymes are weak  
Full of more nonsense, past tense, incomplete  
Weap and learn a new rap style  
From Seth G, the wizard of know how  
An innovation, elevation, psyching the nation  
When I ease back  
Ease back

For soft ducks, I played it once  
A biter jumped on it  
Girls got stupid, freaks humped on it

mostly, with skill, top finesse  
East to West, but I guess, I'm right  
while others are wrong  
Tryin to teach, and usin my song  
along, with your wiggedy-wack  
Stay back, get back, sit back down  
and think about it, whenever you're dissin me  
You are the roach, the six legs wishin me  
and pushin me, steadily on  
Metaphor, better for, psychin more  
On my tour, brains are sore  
I'll be sure, I'm fresher  
So tell me how I..

In town, never wearin no boots

For gold glory, reachin my hand

waitin for me, to tell them, my secret style  
And show them, how really it's done

I took time, and rearranged this  
style like how versatile you ask me now wow  
I'm like ??  
The movie, you seen on TV  
I'll be numerous, but believe me  
I'll chop you up, bash your brain, rotate your liver  
Then I'm gonna give ya, a fresh rhyme, maybe  
Sealed and delivered, by me  
The manufacturer  
Straight out of Attica, I come after ya  
And if ya run, I have to damage ya  
mentally, by using my mind  
Choosing adjectives hard to define  
in rhymes, a dictionary wordpiece  
From the Brainiac, I blew your domepiece  
open, hopin you'll say to me  
""That was dope,"" like an anatomy  
operation on the turntables  
Slicing nerds with verbs, fully enabled  
Equipped, with a white handkerchief  
to wipe away the germs who wanna hang with this  
Ultra smoker, dope man, no joker  
With the line I wrote, and I quote them  
Cause I'm feelin' it!

Into this, while I rap on through this  
For many germs, who never knew this  
  
Switches, upside down  
Turn around, look in the mirror  
You rap catchers are makin' a error  
Every inning, I'm back to the dugout

Male or female, ducks who dream  
Of takin' me, on the mic and makin' me  
Rack up, MC's I stack up

Grass rapper, cut him with a lawnmower  
Twice, into golden wheat  
Ground the rest into moldin meat

They not ready, they don't smell done  
like fish, it ain't my favorite dish  
I grab a steak and to battle I wish  
  
A Coke MC or Pepsi I'll sip up  
Drop your face and bring the other lip up  
Watch, while I stun and amaze you  
Kick out lyrics that truly daze you  
  
I'm your boss, the one that pays you  
Nine to five, all ducks are hired  
And when I come MC's are fired  
No pay, no way today  
  
You're an employer with nothin' to say  
But I can say, one thing for sure  
I'm Housing Things  
  
I think it's pitiful, that you had taunted me  
Your girl sulkin', she wanted me first  
Before you was thought about  
Back in the days, when I taught about  
  
Science, the real construction  
No other solo team or production  
Did that, or got with that  
I play brain ball using a bat  
  
To your skull, smack it out the park  
I rhyme bright and you're in the dark  
With shadows, hallucinating battles  
To compel, the capital K, as in Kool  
  
Combined in Keith  
Rap metal is terminal chief  
And joy, squashin' the beef  
On time. and my mic will stay on  
  
For any roach or germ who wanna pray on  
a weakness, but my uniqueness  
has a way to show that I'm slicker  
Creating rhymes, you have to be, quicker  
And versatile on the microphone  
I'm Kool Keith, cold Housing Things

Sporting a rag top, an El Dorado

The rhymes is gain type, I'm ready to pull it's card  
Jack or Ace, King or Queen, call me the deuce

Getting a trim, I never rhyme like them  
On and on, on and on, on and on until the break of dawn  
I go overtime, rock the mic in nighttime  
Daytime, switching off to Prime time  
Specifically, strolling back in the west time  
Rock the funk wit the mic in the east rhyme  
Hype and dope, hype the frame, the mic is smoking  
Yo, I ain't joking  
Rhyme to kill, rhyme to murder, rhyme to stomp  
Rhyme to ill, rhyme to romp  
Rhyme to smack, rhyme to shock, rhyme to roll  
Rhyme to destroy anything toy boy

Run wit the money, I pull the trigger and damage ya  
Boom, taking life more serious  
I may sound lyrical and very mysterious  
Rhymes are grip tight, no grams to kill more  
A son of Sam, how could I begin more  
Grabbing the mic, you see the dark and shadows  
You're in living hell, the funk, pound to pound  
The funk ignited, hands are writing, brains dividing  
I'm coming out in sighting  
Like I'm Blackula, a better man that Dracula  
Spectacular and not irregular in fact you are speaking impopular  
Rhymes are moved and you can't be stop wit the  
Beat as it goes to the rhyme that flows  
Like a coke in a straw burning up in your nose  
That's a bad habit, stepping out on stage one  
Drop the mic, come and turn to page one  
Look at the master, my range is higher  
My lyrical burns, your brain's on fire

No my name's not mantronix, but I'm 4-h-m  
Kickin flavor so steadily, so wickedy wicked  
Can I switchedy switch it, I saw my troops last night  
They said, ""ced could you kick it?""  
I got mega in concert  
Then I wrote a deposit, I hit my mega-mini  
Zoom back to outer space, ten nine eight seven six  
Five four three - the chain reaction  
Triggered the mad flows, then the rhymin got hyper  
Plus I knew what they like-a, so I ripped it and rock it  
Frequencies in the pocket, one blast two blast  
Yes approximate, green in the chambers  
The lights came on, infrared and exciting  
Most don't know what I'm saying, galactic come beams  
Beams beams beams beams beams beams  
Beams beams beams...  
Now it's classic the atom, no I don't mean the phantom  
Molecules in the mix, with lots of protons to hand them  
Plus I'm billin the workers, secret charts led to persia  
When they're reachin their pick-up, I'ma crossover bezerker  
We turn to the galaxy, the universe bothers me  
From the wild wild west, I have a spaceship mentality  
When I chill at the planet, magnesium flip  
So I shake up the myolex, so what's left?  
  
We are the horsemen -- enter your spaceship! (5x)  
Yee-hah, ride em silver, we out!  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, check it out, yeah..

With these hands built this life

A minimal brain  
Damn I'm like an idiot when I go insane  
Too impulsive too impatient  
Anxiety's got me screamin' this hatred  
Still I strive to stay alive  
Gotta get mine cause I just can't be myself  
  
Cause I just can't fuckin' be myself

"[Verse 1]  
Now everybody wants to have fame  
But you'll pay the price if you're not playin' it by the game  
'cause this game is made up of a bunch of crazy rules  
And fools get took if they're not playing by the rules  
Now, the Ice is kickin' it, kickin' it kickin' it like a champ  
But don't try to play me like some wet food stamp  
They say that it was a fluke  
'cause I used a fat loop  
But here's the sccop, troop  
The Ice is back to make it hoop  
An' since it's 94, and now I'm back on the scene  
Escapin from the hell of takin' it to the extreme  
It's kind of strange, 'cause people say you've changed..  
But I never changed  
Even though I got Fame  
Yo, I'm still the same... Ugh!  
[Verse 2]  
Fame, I'm still the same person  
I never ever switch, an' even if I'm rich  
But now it's like an itch  
'cause I love the music  
They say I do it for the money  
And it's funny, clockin' all the honeys:  
The ones that used to dis  
Now they want to kiss  
Lookin' at what my troops got  
Now they're getting their boots knocked  
Damn it's a shame - do I love 'em  
No I don't ""G""  
A couple of years ago, they didn't want me  
Now I got these so called friends  
It's down with the Ice, 'cause they know I'm makin' ends  
But my real friends have been friends through the fame  
An' since I have fame ain't a damn thing changed  
Yo I'm still the same... Ugh!  
[Verse 3]  
And let me tell you about the pros and the cons  
Fame only lasts if you keep droppin' them bombs  
Now in the public eye - you know I'm havin' to admit it  
You become a target for a whole lot of critics  
Reporters stickin' to ya like white on rice  
Now everywhere I go they want to interview the Ice  
Before every show it's like I'm steadily surrounded  
By all of my fans and the media's houndin'  
This is not a dis 'cause I love all my fans  
But the media doesn't really understand  
They take what ya say, twist it around into lies  
And the next thing ya know  
A bunch of rumors start to fly  
Then they try to make you out to be a straight liar  
And next you'll be the front page of the National Enquirer  
Oh what a price to pay to play this crazy game  
You betta' be prepared if you ever reach fame  
Yo, I'm still the same... Ugh!

Yeah, here's a story bout my homeboy randy  
He was hooked on a girl named candy  
Started off as sex for fun  
Now the girl's got him on the run  
Made love to her just one time  
Now she runs his body and mind  
He calls everyday on the phone  
But baby's playin' games  
Leave a message at the tone  
Soft and gentle is not her style  
This girl is so damn wild  
All my partners want to get next to her  
But she ain't down with that, She moves right through 'em  
Yeah, like paper plates, Tears 'em up and she throws 'em away  
If you had any guts today, You'd get your butt up and you'd walk away  
But you're hooked  
Hooked  
Know what I'm sayin', you're hooked, hooked  
[Verse 2]  
Yo, Get tough was your new campaign  
Cryin' over a girl, boy, you're insane  
She treats you like a dirty diaper  
Use you one time and then she wipes you out  
You understand what I'm sayin'?  
If you're a man, you'll stop delaying and betraying  
Try to act like you were mack  
You can't go an hour without that sex attack  
What's wrong, boy, is it that good?  
There's a lot of girls that would and could  
Take you, But you're so damn weak  
I think you need to seek  
Professional help, For your problems  
Lay on the couch and let the doctor solve 'em  
Talkin' to you and now he took your money  
You're took on that honey, You're hooked  
Hooked, hooked  
Fellas, you know what I'm sayin', he's hooked  
Ain't got an ounce of mack in him, he's hooked

Yeah, baby, run you, she takes your money  
While you'll kick back cryin' over honey  
Now, I must admit she's fly  
But i'll be damned if oh me oh my  
If I ever let a girl run my thing  
I'm poppin' it the most, you know what I'm sayin'?  
So understand, you gotta be real hard  
Don't treat her like a dog, but let her know  
You'll pull her card if she ever gets outta hand  
What is you a boy or a man?  
Stand up and tell baby you ain't gonna be shook  
Yo punk, you're hooked on that sssy  
I don't know why  
I don't stand by  
And just let a girl run over me  
Fool, I'm a man. can't you see  
Boy, you're hooked  
Yeah -- you're hooked, might as well give her to me man  
Let me do the wild thing, you're hooked  
Shoot, I'm poppin' it man, you're hooked

Let me talk to you for second.  
So, what's up, vanilla?  
Yo, man. come here man. what?  
You know, man, you ain't doin' it right. you're off man.  
See, you know what the problem is?  
That ring I bought her. the diamonds weren't big enough.  
I'm tellin' ya' -- the diamonds weren't...i'm goin'...you know  
What she wants...i'm goin' tell ya'...no man, when I first  
Met her she said she wanted a 'vette. I'm gonna' get her a vette

'vette. no man, hey, wait up

Now it's saturday, the day you hate most  
Why, because from coast to coast  
You see girls everday in the club, cold kickin' it  
Reminds you of baby when you used to be with it  
But now she took you one time for sex and you're so sprung

Lickin' your lips, I'm ridin' your hips  
V.i.p. posse and we're pimps  
Be on the lookout in your vicinity  
I'm robbin' virgins of their virginity  
Like robin hood gave to the poor  
I rock kashla and now she wants more  
She calls everday, it's gettin' kinda' silly  
But she rides my saddle like bronco billy  
In a rodeo somewhere out west  
She screams out ""vanilla ice, you're the best!""  
Echoing out, can you hear?  
She screams out everywhere  
Just a pimp and you know  
Snatchin' women, so, yo!  
You can beg, plead and tell me you love me  
But there's no way i'd put a girl above me  
Unless it's sex and you want to' ride  
Jump on my saddle, baby, and get live

Move your body all around  
This is the dope jam, so get down  
Now that you like what I'm sayin' admit it  
This is the jam and vanilla just did it  
I made you work 'til your butt got sore  
In other words, I'm about to get raw  
On stage, it's a v.i.p., doin' dances from a to zpumpin' it, pushin' it, stick
it hard  
I freaked your girl in the back of your car  
I wore a jimmy that I slapped on  
Popped a rubber duckie, so bought me a trojan  
Get ready, hyped into the groove  
As I practiced to make your body move  
You're fienin' for a meanin', oh yes, I'm comin'  
Vanilla ice is here so you suckers start runnin'  
This is the jam I know you're gonna like  
Deshay he cuts like a knife  
He won't smirk and he won't smile  
Deshay get funky for a while

"Yo! here comes the intro  
It's time to let it go  
I live the life of my rhyme, I think I'll let it show  
So, keep it goin' so the mic can stay warm  
Then I know I've been doin' my job 'cause there'll be sweat pourin'  
  
So pick and choose your weapon but don't slip  
I'm here to kill you boys with the flex of my mic grip  
So pump your fist like this, but don't miss  
The hook and the break when you decide to dance to this  
Lyrical concept that's meant for the dance floor  
I know you adore 'cause that's what you came for  
The ice rhymer is back and livin' large  
And when I'm at a show you better wear camouflage  
'cause there was plenty who thought I couldn't swing this  
But now all I get from the crowd is just a pumped fist  
So sing along with the chorus 'cause it's a hit  
Or stay at home alone 'cause ice will be workin' it  
  
[Chorus]  
Work it, work it, work it, work it, work it, work it, work  
It, work it. work it, ice, yea! c'mon and work it baby  
Work it, work it, work it, work it, work it, work it, work  
It, work it. work it, ice, yea! c'mon and work it baby  
  
Go white boy, go white boy, go!  
Check out the hook. vanilla ice, yep, yep  
  
I'm makin' a killin' and chillin' because I'm cool as an ice  
Pack  
You're lovin' everything when I think of a new track  
I keep my rhyme flowin', notice it's right on time  
And separate the wax and keep my mic in line  
So put your body in motion and let me know that you're there  
And those playin' the wall don't be scared  
'cause it's a foundation of breaks put to a beat  
Strong as concrete 'cause I'm rockin' the beat  
I'm in rock mode now' cause I'm steppin' like a soldier  
Move to the groove and try to hold your composure  
Never the less I'm back to attack  
I came to manifest, and express to this dope track  
Blow off the lid for the kid I get nice  
That's why the ladies scraem...oh! vanilla ice!  
Forthcomin' I'm risin' to the top  
The real definition of funk is put to hip hop  
That's what I though, you're cause by the friction  
Pens to the pad when I'm shakin' the mixin'  
What I like to hear is a drummer get wicked  
The tone of a vocal thrown and then kick it  
Don't be surprised if your eyeballs swell  
I know it's hard to regard 'cause I'm loved by the females  
Masses of many, which is plenty, comes to a halt  
No one's in the runnin', so I guess that is my fault  
So pump up the crowd and give 'em somethin' to step to  
My dj's at his max to enhance what I bring you  
The concepts hittin' so follow along like a cookbook  
Acknowledge the pros from all the titles I took, yea  
The crowd's at ease when I breat through the mic end  
As I whip up a dance better move all the mic stands  
I go to work on the floor like a wet mop  
If you've ever been moved, check it out when I rock  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Throw your hands in the air and let's get hyper  
Flip this thing and sting like a viper  
Rollin' with the rhythm, I did it for my opponent  
If there was a crown to be taken, yea, I would own it  
Believe that my rhyme is spoken like it has to be  
With slang to stain it's a sheer catastrophe  
Sheer to the point, to the point it's like lethal  
The dope that I'm sellin' is not even illegal  
But, still knowck you out with clout to make you shout  
To rock the party people sho 'em what it's all about  
Money, yea, is the key to all problems  
If you believe that, then you should surely solve 'em  
'cause I got the key, the key to attack  
The knowledge from my dome, from the top of my track  
To my foes, I can show I can flow 'cause I'm legit  
Thinkin' of a new dance, ice will be workin' it

"Oh yea...In my dreams I envision myself at the ocean  
Beautiful girls rubbin' me down with some lotion

Floatin' on water while splashin' waves on your body  
Flowni' and goin', now pump it, pump it, Hottie  
See, I want to get loose with you, is that all right?  
Girl, I want to' do it outside, under the moonlight  
And get on down so we can make that love  
You be the hand and Iceman'll be the glove  
This is your fantasy, your highest dream  
Fulfillin' all your pleasures the utmost extreme  
Yea...Life is just a fantasy...Yea..  
Now, let me take you out so we can wine and dine  
As I pull you close you pull your lips next to mine  
Oh yeah, you like it like that  
You like it like I do and that's where it's at  
So later on that night as we got in my car  
It started up again we didn't get very far  
You made it very clear that you were not in fear  
Leaned over to me and started kissin' my ear  
Oh girl, you feel so good  
You couldn't wait to get home and I understood  
As we got busy, then I pulled up in the driveway  
You said follow me 'cause we're gonna do it my way  
Walked in the front door you startin' strippin' clothes  
Turned off the lights and assumed the pose  
Closer and closer, hot anticipation  
You walked into the closet, came out in some lace and  
I almost lost my mind, but I kept it in tact  
The lace you was wearin' ohhh, I got an attack  
'Cause this is your fantasy, your highest dream  
Fulfillin' all your pleasures to the utmost extreme  
Yea...Life is just a fantasy  
Yea...Life is just a fantasy  
Come on baby and let me be your toy  
I'll let you do as you wish just to give you joy  
And get down, I know you want to' get loose  
Let's do it like a train and I'll be the caboose  
Or better yet, I'll take you higher, I think that it's time  
To make love to you baby on cloud number nine  
As we start pumpin', sweat pour down my chest  
And that's when you know Vanilla Ice is the best  
You say ooh, ah, ooh, ooh, ah  
I don't know what it means but I like it a lot

"YO! It's the green machine  
Gonna rock the town without being seen  
Have you ever seen a turtle Get Down?  
Slammin and Jammin to the new swing sound  
Yeah, everybody let's move  
Vanilla is here with the New Jack Groove  
Gonna rock, And roll this place  
With the power of the ninja turtle bass  
Iceman, ya know I'm not playin  
Devastate the show while the turtles are sayin

Lyrics, fill in the gap  
Drop that bass and get the NINJA RAP  
Feel it, if you know what I mean  
Give it up, for those heroes in green  
Just flowin, smooth with the power  
Kickin' it up, Hour after hour  
Cause in this life there's only one winner  
You better aim straight so you can hit the center  
In it to win it, With a team of four  
Ninja Turtles that you gotta adore it's the  
  
Chorus  
  
Villains you better run and hide  
Because one day you might not slide  
So choose, your weapon don't slip  
Vanilla's in control with the flex of the mic grip  
Rockin' the crowd the way it should be rocked  
With the Miami drop that you like a lot  
You know it's hittin, Like a ninja turtle  
When the bass kicks in, You better check your level  
The power of the ninja is strong  
Fightin the crooks 'til they're all gone

"[Verse 1]  
Reality sucks, too much pain  
I can't explain why I want to bash brains  
Still I can see it on the other side  
Got a new baby, want to stay alive  
Give what I give, give what I got  
Make it worth while, cause I got another shot  
Broken families that always got pain  
I break the chain, refuse to be the same  
Mother did as good as you could  
After all the abuse I still understood  
Three times divorced, and three times a kid  
Gave us more love than our father ever did  
Now we've all grown and moved along  
Tried to forget, but my brother did me wrong  
But it's real hard to put it all behind me  
It's like a tattoo frozen in a memory  
I can't seem to erase the stain  
In my brain, things will never be the same  
I remember all the lies, fucked up, now I realize  
Never had a chance as a kid, I was a man  
Fight after fight wasn't really what I planned  
Father!  
Whoever you are  
Beat my mother down, all I see is scars  
And memories - what about me?  
Throw me through a window for watching tv  
Where did I get this anger?  
Where did I get this hate?  
And where did I get my temper?  
Now I'm gonna show my faith  
(huh) never will I be like you, be like you  
Fucked up, that shit, I'm staying true  
My family, true to my family  
I'm true to my family  
True to my family  
Stay true  
True to my family  
Stay true, stay true  
True to my family  
Stay true  
True to my family  
Stay true, stay true  
True to my family  
True  
True to my family  
Stay true, stay true  
True to my family  
Stay true  
True to my family  
Stay true, stay true  
Never will I be like you, never will I be like you (Repeat to end)

Now that ya feelin it I see you're getting weak  
You're gettin real close  
You're reachin that peak  
Uh  
You're like high altitude in a lear jet  
Work them hips like a pistons in a corvette  
Slow down or I'll have to pull ya over  
Search ya, handcuff ya, and do a move on ya  
You get a gwb stands for girl with a body pump it like a hottie  
Seems like you got switches and you're hittin em  
Two wheel motion keep bumpin em  
Now throw it east to west and put a hump in it  
Back stroke, and boogie with a bump in it  
Tell me how ya do it like that, how ya got stacked  
How you scrambled like a quarter back  
I want you weak in the knees and shaking in your pants  
And all I want to do is make you dance  
Come on!

Here I come, here I come here I come, here I come here I come, here I come

[Verse 2]  
See the sweat that you're lettin off  
Now, keep it comin girl  
Ya know I love it when you take it off  
You got me sittin in the hot seat  
Drippin from the body heat  
From my head to my feet  
We can do it by candle light all night  
Keep it goin till the sunlight, that's right  
Whatcha tryin to do, make the ice melt?  
Don't you know my cream is good for your health?  
You know you want to shake what your mamma gave ya  
You're getting real hot, now I'm gonna spray ya  
Rub it in like lotion  
Juices flowin everywhere  
Like water in the ocean  
You got that hourglass figure  
Uh, All the right moves  
And ya know I want to dig ya  
Got 31 flavors, know what I mean?  
And I want to take a dip in your ice cream

Here I come, here I come here I come, here I come here I come, here I come  
Here I come, here I come here I come, here I come here I come, here I come  
Here I come, here I come here I come, here I come  
[Verse 3]  
Know I'll be the one to kick this shit off  
And crank it up like a 250  
Engine in a motorcross  
And make ya feel it girl  
Till ya get sick with it  
And all that junk in your trunk  
Don't be stingy with it  
And I'm gonna make it all good like the weekend  
You got enough for yourself and for all my friends  
And it's enough of me to go round like the globe  
Set it up like a tent, watch it unfold  
I see your eyes glistening for the benji's  
But you ain't gotta fake it  
I just want you to shake it  
Break me off a piece of that action like jackson  
I ain't trying to hit it  
And I ain't trying to wax it  
Picture you and me on the beach and you be  
Climbing up this tall coconut tree  
All I want to do is hump with it and make you scream  
And eat you up  
As I floss with your g-string  
[Chorus]  
Here I come, here I come here I come, here I come here I come, here I come  
Here I come, here I come here I come, here I come here I come, here I come  
Here I come, here I come here I come, here I come

Ice is back I got a brand new invention  
Something grabs a hold of me tightly  
Flow like a harpoon daily and nightly  
Will it ever stop? Yo-I don't know  
Now turn off the lights (huh) and I'll glow  
And to the extreme I rock a mic like a vandal  
Light up a stage and wax a chump like a candle

Too cold, too cold  
Too cold, too cold  
Too cold

I'm killing your brain like a poisonous mushroom  
Deadly, now as I play a dope melody  
Anything less than the best is a felony  
Love it or leave it, you better gain way  
You better hit the bull's eye, the kid don't play  
And if there was a problem, yo, I'll solve it  
Check out the hook while my D-J revolves it  
  
Ice ice baby, ice ice baby  
Ice ice baby, ice ice baby  
  
Take heed, 'cause I'm a lyrical poet  
Miami's on the scene just in case you didn't know it  
My town, that created all the bass sound  
Enough to shake and kick holes in the ground  
'cause my style is like a chemical spill  
Feasible rhymes you can vision and feel  
Conducted and formed, this is a hell of a concept  
We make it hype and know you want to step with this  
Swamp plays on the fade, slice like a ninja  
Cut like a razor blade so fast, other dj's say ""damn""  
If rhyme was a drug, you know I'd sell it by the gram  
Keep my composure when it's time to get loose  
Magnetized by the mic and when I kick my juice  
And if there was a problem, you know that I would solve it  
Check out the hook while my dj revolves it.  
  
Ice ice baby (throw your hands in the air, let me know you're out there)  
Ice ice baby, ice ice baby

I had a zig zag story just the other day  
I rolled a fat blunt and yo, it ripped this way  
I took a puff (uh-huh) and what did I see?  
Those motherfuckers still want to I-see-E  
To blaze up a sac of that green bombay  
And when I reach my peak, I explode like dante  
Tha ganjay has got my mind wide open, I'm soakin'  
In the music, I use it, And don't abuse it  
And true, It gets me high like the sky  
I will buy till the day that I die  
You ain't gotta ask me why  
I take tokes from the smoke, I can't deny  
Got a lifetime supply

Get you high all night

Get you high all night  
And I want to get you high

Zig zag stories  
Bang another joint  
Zig zag stories

This is a zig zag story that I had last night  
A six-pack, a joint, And I was feeling all right  
Lit up tha chronic, And what did I see?  
This bad-ass bitch creeping up on me  
She had the look that could get the ice cooked up in a second  
I pictured her undressing and gettin' butt-naked  
She walked up to me and said her name was mary jane  
Ain't no shame in my game, Down to do anything  
Took me by the hand, Ask me if i'd like to fly  
You know I like to fly

Now here's a zig zag story that I'm havin' right now  
Gotta get myself together, Cause some shit is goin' down  
Hit you people off with my new cd  
Hard to swallow, Like saying ""fuck the industry!""  
I'm stompin' through the bayou with my black boots laced  
And takin' out you motherfuckers acting two-faced  
For the people out there gonna blaze 'till I die  
Blaze up the thai

"Coolin' in the shade  
Sippin' on lemonade.  
I hear a knowck on the door who is it?  
Kim, comin' to pay me another visit.  
She tells me that I'm on her mind,  
And a player like me is very hard to find.  
I like the way she licks her lips starin' in my eyes,  
I must admit she's got some juicy thighs.  
I like the way she wears her hair and the tight skirts fit,  
That's why I got her in my mix.  
All she wants to do is hit the sheets and keep it goin',  
That's why I'm mind blowin'.  
  
Mind blowin', blowin' my mind  
  
Ten minutes past, I got my eyes on her ugh  
She's shaped like an hour glass.  
I like the red lipstick, she took a Popsicle out,  
And put it in her mouth quick.  
She whispered in my ear, saying those things that only  
A mac would like to hear.  
You see, I like a girl that really turns me on  
Twist with her walk, and sexy on the telephone.  
She tells me she dreams of me, she wants to be with me  
And not another memory,  
But for now we can hit the sheets baby,  
And keep it goin' now I'm mind blowin'.  
  
Now the heat is on my fingers still in her hair,  
Now she's reaching for my underwear.  
I'm thinking I should make her wait  
For another day, oh I forget, sherri's on the way.  
Off came the top, she's looking in my eyes  
Here we go with the big surprise.  
I guess I can't resist it, hands all over my body  
As she puckered up and kissed.  
Uh, off came the pumps, I'm checkin' out the rump  
She's got a lotta junk in her trunk.  
And finally we hit the sheets, and kept it goin'  
Now I'm mind blowin'.

But before that dude I was fuckin totally in tune

Lettin' loose it's the detonator setting off a time bomb, ring the alarm

Lettin' loose it's the detonator setting off a time bomb, ring the alarm  
I'm coming through with the wickedness  
Inject the fluid of the sickest and watch as I kick this

Lyrical disaster pass the ganja  
Choppin' shit like a bladerunner  
Huntin down my opponents like the predator  
Ready to start my search like the hunt for red October 31st  
Day of my birth had much pain as an adolescent  
Natural stigmata, much drama when Mom's was stressin  
They're on my trail like the bone collector  
Select the sense from my sixth  
Inject the fluid of the wickedness  
Fuck the world! is my motto  
I just can't understand why they point the finger  
When they see me doing my thing  
Bitches swing when they see me pass by  
In the GS4 with the Cane plates bought from my last tour  
It's amityville horror on haters block  
For those that copycat my tactics trying to make it to the top  
Like in the shining when Jack Nicholson got possessed with the wickedness

You really don't want to get into some shit that you'll regret  
Cause like Samuel I hold the whole place for negotiation  
Incarcerating anyone with the temptation trying to test my faith  
(is it safe to come out and play now) is he gone?  
Man I don't understand what kind of high this dude is trippin on  
Pure ICE with a twist of vanilla thriller  
Captivating souls like the body snatchers  
Its return of the living Caucasians  
Of psychopathic mind grabbing Asiatic demonic fanatics  
Causing havoc bringing the pain  
Flaming up like in Backdraft  
Feel the wrath of the lyrical combustion  
Many aren't true to what they're busting  
(from the depths)  
I'm coming through like the Hell Raiser  
It's the end of days there's no escape from the detonator  
Chorus  
Lettin' loose it's the detonator setting off a time bomb, ring the alarm  
I'm coming through with the wickedness  
Inject the fluid of the sickest and watch as I kick this  
Lettin' loose it's the detonator setting off a time bomb, ring the alarm

[Verse 3]  
Yeah, this is the last verse  
Should I say the last round  
And its time I knock out another class clown  
Sit down and take notes  
As Vanilla kicks ballistics with dope lyrics  
Oh what a pity, though  
Cause ya had to spend three million dollars on your video  
It was video and I can admit that  
All that money's wasted cause your song's wack  
I make stuff to make the people gather  
An' let 'em see us in a pit  
I want to slam dance with ya, Hammer  
Now can I kick it, of course I can  
yo, you will get burned out, then turned out  
I'm gonna keep comin strong, song after song  
Ya thought I'd fade, well ya did wrong  
I'm the imperial threat for this sound fools  
Ha Ha, here comes the lyrical beatdown

"
"[Verse 1]  
I Remember way back when  
Lookin' for the right girl to be my friend  
I searched and searched but still never came up  
On the right one who would be mine and the only one  
Luck never came my way  
And all I ever came up with is a broken heart ya see  
I couldn't stand to be alone why my boys  
Straight kick it with the betties while I sat by the telephone  
Everytime I hear it rang it wasn't who I want it to be  
It was just the same ol' thing, Another day another heartache  
No pain, no gain, just Lookin' for a good thing  
Momma use to say don't look for love  
Just let it come around and surely one day it'll be found  
Ya see I'm kinda like 2 Pac, When I get around  
But the ICE goes down  
I go down, I go down, I go down baby, I go down  
I go down, I go down baby doll, I go down  
[Verse 2]  
Step up if ya think ya out there  
I know it's gotta be a tender  
Who'll remember Ice somewhere  
That's only if you're ready for a real one  
I need a tender and yeah I gotta feel one  
I want to tease and please  
And do it all with ease  
But ya gotta be right and all that  
There when I need ya perfect like Kodak  
Picture perfect body like an hour glass figure  
Cool in tha head and I gotta dig her  
The type that never says no  
Cause she's down to the fullest, Cool like the wind blows  
And I ain't trying' to search and find  
I guess it's true when they say that love is blind  
You see I'm kinda like 2 Pac, When I get around  
But the ICE goes down  
[Verse 3]  
Now I'm on tour and got the past behind me  
But I need something to remind me  
Of the days when I played the kissing game  
But now things changed and no I ain't the same  
I made a come up, and now they run up  
They all scream I'm the one, That wants to give the love up  
But ICE ain't got no time for games  
I need a real love, Like Mary J. Blige know what I'm sayin  
But the odds are still against me, I'm making paper  
And still need that one, That wants to be with me  
And not for the money, Nor the fame, But for me  
One who can give me that security  
So if you're out there this one's for you  
You'll be down with me, then maybe I'll be true  
You see I'm kinda like 2 Pac, When I get around  
But the ICE goes down

"
"[Verse 1]  
Girl, I keep thinkin' of how I feel  
When I'm in your arms gives me a chill  
Just knowin' that you want me by your side  
Mellows my mind and enhances my pride  
Girl, I need you more and more each day  
Believe me when I tell you I'm here to stay  
I'm captured by your love and your pretty smile  
You devastating beauty and your sweet profile  
[Chorus]  
I love you, cause I love you  
I love you, cause I love you  
[Verse 2]  
You're so fine, let's wine and dine  
I'm so happy that you are mine  
Thinking of you I melt with desire  
Take you in my arms, let love take us higher  
To hear you talk, sounds so sweet  
When you're close to me I feel your heat  
Girl, I want you and you want me  
And it'll last until eternity  
You're like the snow fallin' from the sky  
So clean, like the look in your eye  
You're my queen, i'll buy you everything  
Yes, girl, even diamond rings  
Cause you're my lady, and this love is true  
Every sunset makes me think of you  
And i'll never forget what you mean to me  
Comin' straight from the heart of vanilla i-see-e  
Chorus  
[Outro]  
Hello girl, when I first saw you. it was love at first sight  
We've been goin' out now for about two years and I still feel the same  
I know I haven't said it much before...well...it's because  
See, I get all choked up inside. it just doesn't want to  
Come out. I don't know. maybe this'll help all the bad  
Things i've done. so, no matter what goes on, no matter  
What happens, always remember...I love you!

Vanilla 'll knock 'em down on their rear, yea!  
Vanilla 'll make 'em all stand up and cheer, yea!  
He's the vanilla! break, break, break down  
[Verse 1]  
Sparklin' like a towerin' inferno  
You want to' learn my songs, this ain't no journal  
It blemished my rhyme, because I'm drawin' the line  
Don't celebrate too soon, 'cause I'm goin' for mine  
Just a character in a made up cartoon  
Like witchel and hazel, boy, you're pushin' a broom  
So get a new life or come equipped with the best  
Mark another one for ice, let the microphone rest  
Just listen to my groove, the beat is strong  
And i'll rock it now, I need a microphone  
I'm in the mood to dance, I'm in the mood to prance  
You tried me once but now you're takin' a chance  
Because I rock with flavor, hard as lifesaver  
You asked for dope, ha...that's what I gave ya'  
A chance to go but now you move too slow  
My juice is pumped and I'm ready to go  
[Chorus]  
Go...it's a party...come on...let's do this...come on..  
[Verse 2]  
Real good...into a new phase, jumpin' up the airwaves  
And now you're amazed 'cause it's hip hop that you crave  
because I'm hyped like an addict, there's no drug involved  
The only thing I need is my record revolved  
Def comin' strong, hard like a matador  
I saw my style, my soul, up on the dance floor  
I want to' see ya' shake, shake and shiver  
You're a charity case, and ice is the giver  
I'm givin' you what you want but you're dumb and naive  
You can't cope with the dop ice has concieved  
Which is a dope jam, hotter than the third degree  
You tried my style but I burn you see  
I'm ice and I'm cold, I'm buildin' igloos of gold  
You want to' bite my style, you gotta' have soul  
'cause a dope like this is not easy to come by  
You don't buy it on, it comes out your hi-fi  
[Chorus]  
It's a party...come on...'let's do this..  
[Verse 3]  
You think it's funy to lack but I'm a brother to mack  
The 808 kickin' base from a dope drum track  
I'm the coolest of cool, kickin' cools silly fools  
You are posse's takin' a dip and vanilla's the pool  
Get ready for my ritual, it's at its' peak  
Silly punks bow down 1st the lyricist speak  
Intruders get slayed, my pockets get paid  
The girlie is jockin' it and just got laid  
See I'm the press you elect, keep the record erect  
In effect, damn, ain't that what you expect?  
Earthquake is on the funk, my homie's not a punk  
Take you antique rhymes and self 'em as junk  
You see, we won't come front' and sellin' drugs and all that shit  
Fake caddies, mack daddies, ain't even legit  
So, get a beeper, you're a sleeper and you need to wake up  
So make the record transform so carwin vegas  
[Chorus]  
It's a party...come on...let's do this..  
[Outro]  
Do it! we don't need no music  
Cause all we want to' do, is sing and dance and party down  
I'm the best, he's the vanilla

"Here it is, a dope hit, Iceman comin' with a dope hit  
Cause a few suckers need their throats slit  
Jealous cause I went multi platinum  
Now I'm gonna blast you in the head  
Till you're dead with my magnum  
Lyrics might be simplistic, but I'm no simp  
On the strip, cause I know how to pimp it  
Now I got grip and suckers keep sinking  
In my quicksand, Vanilla Ice, vocal hitman  
Got the number three in my crosses, sittin' on the rooftop  
Bop bop bop  
And you fools drop, Was a big fl-fl-flop flop  
Brother's didn't like your record 'cause it wasn't hip hop hop  
But this ain't a dis 'cause you sold gold  
Still, I made a killin' and it ain't even a ten eleven million  
Given my rhyming spice while my DJ's on the slice  
Vanilla Ice is back on the map, with the wrath of the Ice king  
No one will stop me  
No one will stop me  
No one will stop me  
Why is that I disperse?  
Why does God shun?  
Why does my man try to run my actions?  
Why is that I disperse?  
Why does God shun?  
Now why does my man try to run my actions?  
My living condition  
[Incomprehensible] my living condition  
My living condition  
[Incomprehensible] it's my living condition  
Etch on a sketch on a rhyme like an architect  
Now watch your back son, cause you might lose your neck  
Pound for pound, I rock the ground I stand on  
I rock records, every record at random  
Flyin' heads, as the heads get full  
[Incomprehensible] speakers get ripped and torn  
To my tomb  
I'm wicked as a witch on a broom stick  
I smash bricks with one lick  
Why is that I disperse?  
Why does God shun?  
Why does my man try to run my actions?  
Why is that I disperse?  
Why does God shun?  
Now why does my man try to run my actions?  
My living condition  
[Incomprehensible] my living condition

No one will stop me  
No one will stop me  
No one will stop me  
You don't get a second chance  
(No one will stop me)  
Cause and tremors bring the scales in hand  
Call the cops, the paramedics, the man's down  
(No one will stop me)  
You wanna rock my bell so I broke them down  
My tongue snapped and cracked like a bull whip  
(No one will stop me)  
And you ain't nothing but my itty bitty target  
And as I walk through the valley of sin

I walk with all you my friends

Crank it up, yo, and let me hear that system bump

I got the funky rhymes that'll please (that'll please)  
And my jams break overseas (overseas)  
So when I come to town be prepared to be hyped up  
'cause when the mic's turned on I get psyched up (psyched up)  
The V.I.P. gets it started with intro  
Bustin' smooth moves on top of instrumental  
Turn up the beats in the Jeeps louder  
Here we go y'all - with minutes of power  
Minutes of power

Minutes of power  
When I step to the mic - bro  
Vanilla Ice does it right  
And what I'm sayin' is - Yo!  
Ya suckers frontin' what ya wantin' is for me to fade  
Thought I was outta here fools  
I ain't goin' away  
Back with the track that will keep my bank fat  
HA! Vanilla's got the flavor for the funky format  
And if you're not givin' up the credit I seek  
VIP's in the house and they're ready to creep  
Now whatcha gonna do when my boys are on you?  
You know a hard head makes for a soft shoe  
So turn it up for the passengers - LOUDER!  
It's Vanilla Killa with the Minutes of Power

Walk through the smoke on the stage  
And the girls scream  
Ice gets 'em hot, then they melt like ice cream  
Flowin' with the swiftness  
Kickin' it with the quickness  
Fella's gettin jealous cause their girlies want a quick kiss  
When I'm rolllin' around in my 5.0 drop top  
Turning up the sounds  
'cause I want to bump the hip hop  
People gettin' mad 'cause they hear the big bass hit  
I turn it up more just to let cha know I won't quit  
Ice has got it locked down and there's no stoppin' it  
When I hear a track like this  
You know that I'll be rocking it  
Sounds so sweet, it could never be sour  
Here we go y'all with the  
M.......minutes of power  
[Verse 4]  
Now's the time for the Ice to let a rhyme rip  
Loadin' up my lyrics with a 9 double M clip  
Shootin' all enemies, you're not even a friend of me  
I ain't Spike Lee so I do the wrong thing, G  
So down with Luther Campbell OH NO  
I don't think so  
Travel state to state an' and the Ice man rips shows  
Steppin' in my path an' you might get broken  
I got it goin' on an' you know I ain't jokin  
Power every hour an' the Ice keeps risin  
Sellin' out arenas so don't look surprised  
When Vanilla shows up an' the place explodes  
An' if ya missed it - catch the next episode!  
Gather up your troops  
Rush 'em to the record store  
An' pick up the new LP from the Ice Man  
So let the funk flow louder  
And let me hit cha - hit cha - hit cha  
With the, with the

Here I come again with my stuff, so let's test it  
I'm cool like the ice, or vanilla, hear my flavor  
Freezin up the mic, I hit you with somethin you can savor  
No slippin, no stonin, I am gettin to the point  
So hit the mad ism and light another joint  
The easy like stylist with a kick when I'm kicking  
No tripping, I'm hitting, so get a good grip in  
Get with a style I be using, and there's no dissin  
And here's a quick lesson - I carry a smith and wesson  
Listen up close and there'll be no confusion  
Now you're addicted to mentally abusing  
Word to the mother I'm hear to tear it up  
And if you can't get with it, I don't give a fuck  
So run to your crew and tell them I am hear  
This here is for the people  
[Chorus]  
It's the funky rhyme killer  
The dope song thriller  
Get your ass back, before you get caps in ya  
It's the funky rhyme killer  
The dope song thriller  
Get your ass back, before you get caps in ya  
It's the funky rhyme killer  
The dope song thriller  
Get your ass back, before you get caps in ya

Everytime I get a little hit of the ummm

Fire, Fire, The izm is my desire  
And I need to get it quick cause it's callin me  
Come and roll me up please I-see-E  
Light the hooty mac, So we can start the par-ty  
You know I smoke good stuff, So go and get the bong

You feel it, You feel it, You want it, You want it  
Roll it, Roll it, Lick it - Now hit it

You see everytime I wake up, I got to clear my head

Never get silly, So pass me the philly  
Blunt, and no I don't front like Zero  
Who wears a chronic hat but always says no

Don't it feel good enought to jump and touch the ceiling

It's good to the bone, Cause the buzz is real strong  
Even though I can not stand it, But I recommend it  
Especially when ya sick with a cold, so spend it  
You know that twenty dollars that you've saved Throughout the week?  
If you're a non smoker, Then please don't try to speak  
The plan, The plan, Ya know I've got a plan  
Squirrels got the goods, Now tell me who's the man  
But not really the man that you call when you want it  
Ya know I stay legit, and I've got to stay up on it  
On and On Yo, Give me a ho [Ho!]  
And ask me what I want to do, then I'll let you know  
You feel it, you feel it, you want it, you want it  
Roll it, roll it, lick it - now hit it

"[Intro]  
Strictly from the islands, vanilla ice  
The man jam down reggae music  
Mash it up ice, mash it  
[Verse 1]  
I got the rhyme to keep the body pumpin'  
Turn the party out while the people are jumpin'  
Reggae style at the top of my list  
Is hitting real hard like mike tyson's fist  
It is so good that the girlies goin' crazy  
Vanilla's on the mic and you know I'm not lazy  
I'm pumpin' up the lyrics in a smooth way  
I drop 'em like a bum rush much as what we say  
The other mc's try to duplicate  
But with the rosta man they just mediate  
[Chorus]  
Rosta man you be jammin' so smooth  
You rockin' on the mic and you can only improve  
Rosta man you know you sound so sweet  
I like the way you put the lyrics to the funky beat  
Ah rae rue, re rae rah  
Reggae rock has the style to chase the blues away  
Ah rae rue, re rae rah  
Reggae rock has the style to chase the blues away  
[Verse 2]  
Me and i, myself and you  
The rosta man, deshay and the rest of my crew  
Reggae music's been around for a while  
Vanilla ice is doin' it the hip hop style  
Because this is the one that we call the rae rue  
Everybody out there you know just what to do  
Just clap your hands and stomp your feet  
Move around to the sound of the reggae beat  
No push, no fall, no shove, no trip  
The rosta man wants you to get with it  
[Chorus]  
[Verse 3]  
Well the people out there let me hear you scream  
If you want to get down and you want to be seen  
Then jump up my man, do the rosta man  
Move your head up and down to the reggae jam  
Just shake your arms and move your hips  
All you females out there let me shake your  
And just get down like you're makin' love  
All you people who believe in god above  
[Chorus]  
[Verse 4]  
From the ah rae rue, the re rae rah  
The jack tar village in jamaica  
Ocho rios or the way to kingston  
If we go back to the homeland again  
Back on tour from city to city  
Rollin' with the girls with the big, big ahhh..  
Pity the fool who step it to me  
I drop 'em like a fly, I better get the flea

"[Verse 1]  
Saturday night, The club was packed, But I can't get no action  
The girl I want is frontin hard, I can't get no satisfaction  
Thousand people up in the club and the music's thumpin hard  
I must admit that I was slightly anxious to have my card  
Pooled by a girl in a nice tight dress  
The kind that makes ya body wet, Hmm, I must confess  
I tryed and she said no, But fellas yo, I can't get no  
[Chorus]  
I can't get no [Yeah]  
I can't get no [Ya know what I'm sayin?]  
I can't get no [Yep, Yep]  
Satisfaction, Ah hey hey hey  
You know what I say  
That's what I say  
Yeah  
[Verse 2]  
Girlie at the bar, Lookin mighty fly  
She look so fly at the time  
I had to make up, You know, My mind  
So I walked up to her gently, Just so I can speak  
Man, she turned around and scoped me down and started doin the freak  
I tryed all I could, I even said please  
She moved my hands off her booty, Cause she was a skeeze  
Man, I had to escape, So I could get away  
I told her what was up, She said come back another day  
[Chorus]  
[Verse 3]  
The party's almost over, The club's about to close  
I saw this girl who rocked my world, So I suppose  
I'll take another chance, A try at romance  
I couldn't take my eyes off the back of her pants  
I moved very smoothly, A nice conversation  
The perfume she was wearing, Ooh, Sensation!  
She seemed kinda worried, Like something was wrong  
Tyson at my back, I had to move along

"
"1,2,3,4  
It was an average night backstage at a show  
I seen this girlie that I knew, she was a cutie and Yo!  
She had it goin' on from her head to her feet  
Her shape was so petite, and so unique  
Her eyes flamed with passion like she was possessed  
As I shivered and quivered while she rubbed on my chest  
'Slaved and engraved I couldn't scream  
Moaning and groaning like she could take on the A-Team  
I was one of many that she'd choose  
Do me, pursue me, twice as nice but don't refuse  
Leaving her breathless as the sweat poured on  
The spot that I was in was so soft and warm  
This was far from a story you will find in a book  
Hot off the platter, and boy, could she cook  
Roastin' my body it left a stain in my brain  
And all I kept sayin' to myself was  
Stop that train, I want to' get off  
Stop that train, I want to' get off  
Oh my God, what have I got into?  
Sooner or later I thought she'd get the clue  
'Cause my body was tired and full of sweat and perspire  
The situation I was in could've started a campfire  
No more skeezin' and teasin' for the Ice right now  
I found me a corner, play it cool for a while  
Just mackin' and schemin' on a woman I thought was cool  
But now I realize that the Ice was the fool  
'Cause a woman will play you, lay you and obey you  
You better watch your back 'cause a woman will slay you  
Not to mention the one who got me  
Yea, she got me, the I-see-E  
But, back to the story of a one night stand  
I thought I was strong but she was He-man  
Lovin' every second tryin' to make me blush  
And all 'n all it was for the lust  
I though, she was an angel and soft as a cream puff  
Until I seen her come out with the whip and handcuffs  
Breathin' down my neck I was scared to death  
The sweat from my body as it rolls down my neck  
And out of all nights, where was my crew?  
'Cause this was somethin' I didn't know what to do  
D already told me that the girlie was strange  
But I didn't know until she pulled out the chains  
Walkin' and stalkin' towards me with a plan  
And now I regret all the things I was sayin'  
Now the moment is critical, so what should I do?  
Leave while I can, or just take the abuse  
Now I'm drippin' with sweat, Why? 'Cause I'm afraid  
Handcuffs and chains is a game I don't play  
No doubt in my mind that the girlie is the boss  
Stop this train 'cause I want to get off  
Stop that train, I want to' get off  
Stop that train, I want to' get off  
Later on that night as it got worse  
My body's steamin' up and I was ready to burst  
She had me hot as a skillet taken from a flame  
And my admission was free for me to ride on this train  
Yea, I must admit to myself, it was fun  
But, now I'm lookin' for my shoes, I'm ready to run  
So, now I'm hopin' and prayin' for the moment to come  
'Cause I couldn't move and my body was numb  
So, now what have I done to get myself into this?  
It started from a kiss, now I'm ready to resist  
I couldn't take it no more, on the bed, or the floor  
My knees were gettin' weak and my back was gettin' sore  
The room was destroyed, not to mention my body  
Why did I ever tell her to ""Pump it, Hottie?""  
What could I do to just ease the pain?  
I think I'll let the hook just try to explain  
Stop that train, I want to' get off  
Stop that train, I want to' get off

"Now here's a Zig Zag story while I'm writing this song  
Sit back relax I'm igniting this bong  
Picture this sandy beaches dimes wearin thongs  
Serving mixed drinks to me all night long  
With me feet back puffin on my weed sack  
Shit you can't believe that people ask me  
Where you buy your trees at  
Got the Bombay Ganje lime green  
Sticky icky Ganja got me needing Visine  
  
Like a magic carpet ride come fly with me  
And this is for my homies that get high with me  
Just crack the Phillie open cause we keep on smoking  
  
Dimes rubbin on lotion  
Feet soaking in the ocean  
On a tropical Island staying sunny  
We outta Phillies take these skins somebody roll a Mummy  
Now people say money makes the world go round  
  
So come escape with me and let's puff on a pound.

So high fly through the sky  
And ride my life high  
Fly through the sky  
  
  
No matter what you say  
Feeling so alright so Ire today

No responsibility man  
  
No responsible  
Me I go rolling a fat blunt  
Smoking the fat blunt  
This is my goal.  
  
Take it easy Rastaman  
  
I will now go blaze  
From Kingston Jamaica  
  
Bombay to India  
Smoking in the air  
What da da da day  
Some of them are smoking  
Weed to take away frustration  
I and I do it for me aggravation  
Dreadlock to Babylon are selling everyday  
Come me say  
Bringing it back on the boat back to the USA  
With the ganja me floating me floating away  
  
Why not come and puff with me and then we go fly away  
  
Chorus repeat  
  
Well it's the sticky icky bomb Holmes  
Got the fat sacks puffier than Sean Combs  
It's the Ice man back blowin dookie out the nostrils  
In the studio creating shit that's colossal  
Apostle of the green bud see me bleemed up  
In my 430 Lexus off in Texas teamed up  
With the Darkman and we're blazing  
Some headbanging shit yo the Ice'll come equipped  
  
To spit with the best cause I'm all about mine  
I got dimes of smoke that'll make you float on cloud nine  
  
Then I shine just like a beacon in the night  
Pass me the Thai I get high on the mic  
For real a zig zag story for my peeps  
Bangin in the Jeeps while you slang it in the streets  
Like Napalm I'm way gone and now it's time to bounce

Stay on the low with a M-16 flow  
In the Benz with a dime bitch, puffin hydro

Yo, I flow like a UFO, All-Pro  
Rich kid, get my dick sucked in a Tahoe

Cock it back, then smoke a Nigga like a Philly

Step on stage with funky hip-hop apparel  
Got the funky rhymes sometimes they leave you scared bro

You know the Ice'll do it right, what I'm saying is ""Yo""

Thought I was outta here, I ain't going away!  
Back with the track, I keep my bank fat  
You know I got the flavor for the funky format  
You're not giving up, the credit I seek  
Darkman's in the house he's ready to creep  
Now what you gonna do  
When my boys are on you  
You know a hard head makes for a soft shoe  
Now crank it up for your passenger - LOUDER

Get the van from Rock and then  
Call up Ishcabibble's, Jim's and Pat's  
And tell 'em we need cheese steaks for like, 300 cats  
And yo, make sure it's hot or else I'm sending 'em back  
And get my mic right  
If I get hyped, I might rap  
Then take the speakers find a good spot  
Subs on the bottom, tweeters up top  
Yo, you know where little John lives on the corner  
The extension cord'll run perfectly to his crib  
And then tell Officer Mike to barricade the block  
Regardless what car you got, leave it up top  
You want to come, you got to come on your feet  
Ain't nothing like having a party  
When it's out in the street, come on

A dozen divas from North Philly drove in when they heard  
That it's a block party down in West Philly  
Come block party with Jeff and Big Willy  
Stand back, everybody come to see the man rap  
Jeff got it, jam packed  
Everybody, hands in the air

All it mean is that it's time to turn the lights on  
All day long I been plotting on this nice john  
It's ten o'clock now Jeff is trying to hype me  
Will the Fresh Prince come up to the mic please?  
Hear the crowd cheer, brought a little smile out  
Mic check, one, two- I'm 'bout to wild out  
I know he's old, but  
Maybe it's a slight chance  
I could get my brother hype  
Make him break dance- ha, maybe not  
Lemme get the crowd jumping  
Let me him 'em with the brand new funk or something  
I'm like Rob Base- I want to rock right now  
why yall know who run the block right now  
All we need is a mic and a beat  
And a couple of speakers  
And some turn tables out in the street, come on!

It's so hard to keep my sanity  
Now I can do is sit back and reminisce  
Look at the pictures in the frames yo  
Why you playin' games yo  
  
As I think back to the begining we was together  
We both loved sports long walks and autumn weather  
Both wanted kids and a family a strong personality  
I liked the way you handled me  
Candles be lit mood set food set you ready yet  
That's what you said while you was massagin' my head  
Now look here I could never leave you lonely  
'Cause the love you showed me had me feeling like you already had known me  
'Member when you used to blindfold me till I don't see  
Use your mind that's what you told me  
Kissin' me slowly  
Never was the loud type always on the low key  
Pretty style but rugged  
Damn I brother I loved the  
  
The birds of a feather 'sposed to fly together  
Guess that don't apply to birds of your kind  
'Cause you only wanted what you wanted like a poacher  
Came to steal my heart and leave me to die  
(I ain't going out like that though)  
  
All my mind  
All my soul  
From the very start  
I gave you full control and you broke my heart  
I tried to show you a better way of life  
But I see that must be what you like  
I loved you more than anything  
I tried to build the future turn a house into a home  
I wanted us to be one flesh and one bone  
It's so hard to keep my sanity  
Now I can do is sit back and reminisce

Nah nah nah.  
The good guys dress in black, remember that  
Just in case we ever face to face and make contact  
The title held by me, MIB  
  
Means what you think you saw, you did not see  
So don't blink be what was there is now gone  
The black suits with the black Ray Bans on  
Walk in shadow, move in silence  
  
Guard against extra-terrestrial violence  
But yo we ain't on no government list  
We straight don't exist - no names and no fingerprints  
Saw somethin' strange, watch your back  
  
'Cause you never quite know where the MIBs is at  
Uh, eh  
  
Here come the Men In Black, Men In Black  
Galaxy defenders.

Aha, aha  
Now, From the deepest of the darkest night  
On the horizon, bright light enters sight tight  
Cameras zoom, on the impending doom  
  
But then like BOOM black suits fill the room up  
With the quickness, talk with the witnesses  
Hypnotizer, neuralizer  
Vivid memories turn to fantasies  
  
Ain't no MIBs, can I please  
Do what we say, that's they way we kick it  
D'ya know what I mean  
I see my noisy cricket get wicked on ya  
  
We're your first, last and only line of defense  
Against the worst scum of the universe  
So don't fear us, cheer us  
If you ever get near us, don't jeer us, we're fearless  
  
MIB's freezin' up all the flack  
What's that stand for? Men In Black  
  
The Men In Black

And we be places that you need not be  
So go on with your life

"Summer, summer, summertime  
Time to sit back and unwind  
  
Here it is the groove slightly transformed  
Just a bit of a break from the norm  
Just a little somethin' to break the monotony  
Of all that hardcore dance that has gotten to be  
A little bit out of control it's cool to dance  
But what about the groove that soothes that moves romance  
Give me a soft subtle mix  
And if ain't broke then don't try to fix it  
And think of the summers of the past  
Adjust the bass and let the alpine blast  
Pop in my CD and let me run a rhyme  
And put your car on cruise and lay back cause this is summertime  
  
Chorus  
  
School is out and it's a sort of a buzz  
But back then I didn't really know what it was  
But now I see what happened is  
The way that people respond to summer madness  
The weather is hot and girls are dressing less  
And checking out the fellas to tell 'em who's best  
Riding around in your jeep or your Benzos  
Or in your Nissan sitting on lorenzos  
Back in Philly we'd be out in the park  
A place called the plateau is where everybody goes  
Guys out hunting and girls doing likewise  
Honking at the honey in front of you with the light eyes  
She turns around to see what you beeping at  
It's like the summer's a natural aphrodisiac  
And with a pen and pad I compose this rhyme  
To hit you and get you equipped for the summer time  
  
Chorus  
  
It's late in the day and I ain't been on the court yet  
Hustle to the mall to get me a short set  
Yeah I got on sneaks but I need a new pair  
Cause basketball courts in the summer got girls there  
The temperature's about 88  
Hop in the water plug just for old times sake  
Break to ya crib change your clothes once more  
Cause you're invited to a barbeque that's starting at 4  
Sitting with your friends cause y'all remincise  
About the days growing up and the first person you kiss  
And as I think back makes me wonder how  
The smell from a girl could spark up nostalgia  
All the kids playing out front  
Little boys messin round with the girls playing double-dutch  
While the DJ's spinning a tune as the old folks dance at your family  
Reunion  
Then six o'clock rolls around  
You just finished wiping your car down  
It's time to cruise so you go to the summertime hangout  
It looks like a car show  
Everybody come lookin real fine  
Fresh from the barber shop or fly from the beauty salon  
Every moment frontin' and maxin'  
Chillin in the car they spent all day waxin'  
Leanin' to the side but you can't speed through  
Two miles an hour so everybody sees you  
There's an air of love and of happiness  
And this is the Fresh Prince's new definition of summer madness

[Will Smith]  
September 11th I woke up about 7 AM  
West coast time, french toast and my turkey bacon  
Takin' my time awakin, turnin' my TV on  
To my surprise, saw what everybody in the world saw  
Me and my children, images were chillin'  
My son said - daddy were there people in that building?  
A cold sweat, frozen with a lump in my chest  
I heard his question, couldn't bring my lips to say yes to him  
That night at my son's side, he cried  
And prayed for the ones who died in the World Trade  
His palms to God, seeds of qualms with God  
He just, kept on pressin' me, wanna know why  
Then one week later our bombs were dropped  
We seein' them, on CNN, they just won't stop  
The infrared, images of brutal attack  
He said ""Daddy now we killin' 'em back,"" right right  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Souls are captured (souls are captured)  
Dreams are stolen (dreams are stolen)  
Hearts are broken (hearts are broken)  
Evil plaguin' he rewardin'  
Hate surrender (hate surrender)  
Love exalted! (Love exalted!)  
Hope elated! (hope elated!)  
Negativity destroyed and..  
  
[Will Smith]  
Honest to God, why is the bomb always gettin' the last word  
and why, did her uncles have to molest her  
and why, did all them cops have to be shootin' to kill?  
And why, did all them priests have to act so ill?  
Tell me why did James Byrd Jr. have to be touched?  
Tell my why did Malcolm and Martin depart from us  
Tell me why did the sniper make that little boy shoot  
And why, is human life always denied for loot?  
Tell me WHY did MANDELA have to live in a cage  
Why did my brother Sterling have to die at that age  
Tell me why did Reginald Denny deserve his fate  
And why the fuck can't love, seem to defeat hate?  
Tell me why is it so hard for all the children to eat?  
Why did 'Pac and Biggie Smalls have to fall in the street?  
Tell me why did Jam Master Jay have to go that way?  
Please, what am I supposed to say my kids when they say  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Will Smith]  
Can't explain it baby life is just really crazy  
I mean if it's world wars or the life of a little baby  
We got more stores than they got rice under buddha lazy  
You live four scores and still it be drivin' you crazy  
But for me I try to see the button side  
Sometimes it be like the goodness be tryin' to hide  
or tryin' to flee, but it can't, it's deep inside  
Sweetie you be the light for others, make 'em believe in God

Fighting for life, this my life  
That's why I liked on my vices  
Tightening the vices of truth on the roofless  
This is rhyme and the crime and their minds is just useless  
The path of the poison, the genesis of the genisi  
You and your boys trying to decide, what to write  
But your hand is a sword and the blade has been forged  
Young minds getting gorged Stakes have been altered  
By lick or by weed and then hate gets exalted  
As art falls to greed, Choices is Made that's the voices is laid  
On the track, contract, the soldier wage, did you see his new benz,  
But your like a syringe now proud of your binge.  
  
Got a lot of new friends, got a lot of new ends  
Bought a house up in the hills fronting shouts to the pen  
Giving false accounts of your account's amounts  
Amounts the fans treason stands to reason since your inception  
Laced with deception and bred with false affection it must perish  
From the Terrace I see the fire burning the streets but I won't shield my eyes
to the heat  
Born to reign  
  
I was Born to reign  
  
I was Born to Reign

"Early mornin' wake up  
Gently with the Caress on your hand  
And that Kimono that I bought you on my trip to Japan  
Sunshine peekin' through the venitian blinds  
  
Four years, and like wine, you got finer with time  
I got a question, if the prodda dressin' and the Gucci  
All got goes, and the freeze on the Lucci  
I mean real bad girl, I'm talking rougher than rough  
  
Do you think it'd be enough if we just had us?  
Don't answer quick, think about it cause I'm askin' for real  
Golddiggers goin' to hear this song drivin' and crash at the wheel  
Forever is a long time, so far we gettin' along fine  
  
No car I ever drove, no ice I ever saw  
No music I ever made, ain't nothin' I wanted more  
We could deal with whatever together  
Sunshine, all that other weather, when we chasin' forever  
  
[Chorus]  
I want to stay with you forever  
I want to spend all my life with only you  
I want to stay, lets stay together  
Chasing forever, with only you  
  
Chasin' forever, a buckwild, endeavorous scene  
Should we pursue with somethin' real or just chasin' a dream  
Or casin' the scene  
Fore I die I plan  
  
To see your soul and eternity in the palm of my hands  
Now as a man, there's certain things I'm lackin for sure  
But I'm committed to growin and coming at you mature  
In the future, I know it ain't gonna be all good  
  
But when we feelin' the hurt, if we willin' to work  
The eight ball will never turn to see us behind  
Though I ain't no knight, and my armor don't shine  
My mom said the lynch pin of love is trust  
  
An taught me monogomy is uh, monogamous  
Plus, for you dinner by candlelight  
Now don't commit before you sure you understand me right  
It's a race to a strange place, most see never  
It's a chase we gotta make together, forever  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now you would think after all my heartbreaks I'd be cruel  
Hiding behind my ego, evil but no  
Much the contrary, I'm very much certain  
You searchin' for joy, it's on the other side of hurtin'  
  
Finally found a person, worthy of all  
Instead of pushin' me down, you want to cushion my fall  
Your eyes could make the sun rise, all the birds sing  
Seal it with a kiss, bind it with a ring  
  
More carrats than even bugs could eat in a week  
An the ribbon in the sky, close your eyes don't peek  
I'll tell you what I see in the future  
A hacienda so cute with, five little kids callin' you mom and callin' me dad  
  
Havin more good times than JJ had  
Judging by the look in your eyes, you see it  
Let no man sever, welcome to forever  
  
[Chorus: x3]

"Yo  
When I released my first single back in like '86  
People was like oh you know that's popcorn and you know they weak  
You know then I mess around I go world trade on them  
Bangin' out them multi-plastic still got negativity to bring  
My thing is you can't say nothing nice don't say nothing  
  
Take your place allow me to flex a taste  
As my accomplishments bring up my comp like mase  
Face me the star of stage and TV  
My face be seen in almost every country  
  
Grammy winner soon to be oscar nominee  
Who he that's dressed jiggy straight from west Philly  
Thought I was whack 'cause I wanted to act  
Now every brother and his mother that rap be trying to do that  
  
The ill kid  
Hundred million dollar bill kid  
The one you love to chill with come on keep it real kid  
Don't try to act like this summer at the greek  
  
You won't be bumpin' the big Willie in your jeep  
I know y'all still feel me  
Really don't act silly  
Thought I feel off just becuase I left Philly  
  
Took a break from the rap thing went on hiatus  
I picked up the art of acting and multiplied papers  
I chilled on silk sofas chatting with Operah  
She asked me if it's true that me and Jeff broke up  
  
While y'all kids busy playing drug pimp and playa  
I was at my crib in Barbados chillin' with Jada  
Vertex is me the magnanamous  
God you sayin' damn I've always been a fan of his  
  
Y'all know how it is oh wait hold up y'all don't  
Look here y'all don't say nothing than I won't  
  
Just don't say nothing  
  
Man I love being me ready to rock the block  
With some more hot top notch ---- for you to cop  
No more mr. nice guy  
My whole life I've been smiling when I felt like whiling  
  
Jealousy swinging on me made his attack  
(he soft he whack man that ain't real rap)  
You believe that  
It hurt me at first but it's cool  
  
Took the insults feed it to my ego for fuel  
Now everywhere I turn a dead end  
Hundred women coming at me waving pads and pens  
And they be screaming out  
  
(oh my lord)  
Did you see it's that brother from  
(ID4)  
Now can I please get  
  
(a picture and your signature)  
Sure you can miss  
(oh my god my girlfriends they ain't gonna beleive this)  
Worldwide wait nah hold up galactic  
  
Hear my name don't nothing change but the accent  
Bangok to Madagascar they wanna see me  
Prince epe in Spain Japan I'm cota eshe  
I like my steaks thick and my jets private  
  
And my son to ride in the cockpit  
I know he's only four taking lessons from the pilot  
While I'm on my cell with my broker getting stock tips  
Find a magazine and I read the hottest gossip  
  
Man who'd a thought my life would be such an interesting topic  
Well y'all know how it is wait hold up y'all don't  
Well look here y'all don't say nothing than I won't  
  
Just don't say nothing  
Just don't say nothing

Go ahead adjust the balance and the bass in your speakers  
Make sure my voice sounding crisp in your tweeters  
I'm about to show you how a man like me works  
Shorty get ice five carrots and nothing cheaper  
  
Four five chromed out former two seater  
Fifty inch sony to watch Siskel and Ebert  
'Cause I'm about to get two thumbs ten toes one knee and probobly a couple  
Of elbows  
  
'Cause yo I'm the man and the whole world knows  
Rock film fests to vos and rap shows  
All the critics jealous people and back-stabbers  
My so-called friends who been nothing but actors  
  
You're way of charachter but now who's the bomb  
It's Will from west Phil just slightly transformed  
Y'all know what it is  
Ah damn that's right y'all don't  
But look here y'all don't say nothing then trust me I won't

"Now, this is a story all about how  
My life got flipped-turned upside down  
And I'd like to take a minute  
Just sit right there  
I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel Air  
  
In west Philadelphia born and raised  
On the playground was where I spent most of my days  
Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool  
And all shootin some b-ball outside of the school  
When a couple of guys who were up to no good  
Started making trouble in my neighborhood  
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared  
She said 'You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel Air'  
  
I begged and pleaded with her day after day  
But she packed my suit case and sent me on my way  
She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket.  
I put my Walkman on and said, 'I might as well kick it'.  
  
First class, yo this is bad  
Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass.  
Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like?  
Hmmmmm this might be alright.  
  
But wait I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, all that  
Is this the type of place that they just send this cool cat?  
I don't think so  
I'll see when I get there  
I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air  
  
Well, the plane landed and when I came out  
There was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with my name out  
I ain't trying to get arrested yet  
I just got here  
I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared  
  
I whistled for a cab and when it came near  
The license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror  
If anything I could say that this cab was rare  
But I thought 'Nah, forget it' - 'Yo, holmes to Bel Air'  
  
I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8  
And I yelled to the cabbie 'Yo holmes smell ya later'  
I looked at my kingdom  
I was finally there  
To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel Air

"
"On your mark ready set let's go  
Dance floor pro I know you know  
I go psycho when my new joint hit  
Just can't sit  
Got to get jiggy wit it, thats it

Watch your step you might fall  
Trying to do what I did  
Mama-unh mama-unh mama come closa'  
In the middle of the club with the rub-a-dub  
No love for the haters  
Mad cause I got floor seats at the Lakers  
See me on the fifty yard line with the Raiders  
Met Ali he told me I'm the greatest  
I got the fever for the flavor of a crowd pleaser  
DJ play another  
From the prince of this  
Your highness  
Only bad chicks ride in my whips  
South to the west to the east to the north  
Bought my hits and watch 'em go off a go off  
Ah yes yes y'all ya don't stop

Who's the kid in the drop  
Who else Will Smith  
Livin' that life some consider a myth  
Rock from south street to one two fifth  
Women used to tease me  
Give it to me now nice and easy  
Since I moved up like George and Wheezey  
Cream to the maximum I be askin' 'em  
Would you like to bounce with the brother that's platinum  
Never see Will attackin' 'em  
I rather play ball with Shaq and 'em  
Flatten 'em

"[Verse 1 (Will Smith)]  
Uh, check, check  
Yo, yo, yo  
Across the room shared a little gaze with me  
Crazy mama how your scent played with me  
Eyes never hiding your heart angelic looking  
Faking disinterest but I can tell you're looking  
Face to face her eye to eye stance with me  
Didn't even say nothing I felt you want to dance with me  
You push me back a little when I kissed your hand  
Said you was attracted to me truly but you had a man  
I put my finger up don't say nothing  
He ain't here is he? We can play or something  
He at the crib oh, I see you live with him  
What you gone get married to him and have some kids with him  
Us could be just a weekend thing  
Just a weekday thing, just a thing ma  
Look we can have everything else  
But for tonight let me have you for myself  
Girl holla at me  
  
[Chorus (Tra-Knox)]  
You can have the rest of your life  
Give me tonight  
You can have the rest of your life

So let me jump in the zone  
Can't you feel the Jones

[Verse 3 (Will Smith)]  
Thinking of living your life as a hundred yards long  
Give me a quarter-inch that's all I'm asking  
Do the math I'm the sun you the earth  
Its you-N-I-verse and its the worst  
Cause I thirst to tape connect her  
I know you got a life momma  
Trust me I don't want to bring your life drama  
I can barely hear my think slide with me  
Dip out the side door take a ride with me  
Let me hear about (Uh)  
What you think about (Uh)  
What you need to do (Uh)  
The things you dream about  
Your Body with me but I know where your heart's at  
Let it ring ma call him back  
Wishing I could stop the clock to make it last with you  
Am I goin' be at home alone with a glass slipper  
Is it a sin to pretend with another fella  
Midnight the story ends like Cinderella

Mirror, mirror, need I call?  
You know, uno, bad breath an all  
Times I been fed up, still didn't let up  
'Stead a doin dirt, did work and kept my head up  
Set up  
For the future, much love to my girl  
North Pole got my butt cold (sittin on top of the world)  
An I'm feelin (so high)  
Touch the ceiling (the sky)  
You say I smile cause I'm on top of the pie  
But yo, the cream can only finance the smile for a little while  
My grin got longevity, got family backin me  
That's why I'm livin happily  
Ever after, love and laughter  
Hussle cause I wants to, not cause I have to  
Ask yourself, who made the polar caps melt?  
FP, the phenomenon, true Don Juan, Jon Blaze  
The Fonz ain't seen my Happy Days  
The track plays, I'm in the shades, singin a phrase

Take my hand  
Watch me freak this  
Ah-mommy's tryin ta creep this  
Tryin to entice me to let it off  
But nah, (why not?) c'mon baby, you saw Set It Off  
Proposition by trio, in Rio  
Menage Trois, down at the Marde Gras  
But nah, my clothes by Versace  
My attitude cocky, the sym- it's Imanyaki  
Like a felon, no tellin what I do next  
I don't front cause I'm paid, but I do flex  
Southwestern, crib like a villa  
Vacation on a mountain in Manilla  
Rhyme spilla, real thrilla  
An it's real clear  
Y'all talkin East and West, I'm talkin hemispheres  
My papa raised no fool  
So many zeros on my check it's like, oooooooooooohh

"Now dad this is a very sensitive subject)  
From the first time the doctor placed you in my arms  
I knew I'd meet death before I'd let you meet harm  
Although questions arose in my mind, would I be man enough?  
  
Against wrong, choose right and be standin' up  
From the hospital that first night  
Took a hour just ta get the carseat in right  
People drivin' all fast, got me kinda upset  
  
Got you home safe, placed you in your basonette  
That night I don't think one wink I slept  
As I slipped out my bed, to your crib I crept  
Touched your head gently, felt my heart melt  
  
'Cause I know I loved you more than life itself  
Then to my knees, and I begged the Lord please  
Let me be a good daddy, all he needs  
Love, knowledge, discipline too  
I pledge my life to you  
  
[Chorus]  
Just the two of us, we can make it if we try  
Just the two of us, (Just the two of us)  
Just the two of us, building castles in the sky  
Just the two of us, you and I  
  
Five years old, bringin comedy  
Everytime I look at you I think man, a little me  
Just like me  
Wait an see gonna be tall  
  
Makes me laugh cause you got your dads ears an all  
Sometimes I wonder, what you gonna be  
A General, a Doctor, maybe a MC  
Haha, I want to kiss you all the time  
  
But I will test that butt when you cut outta line, trudat  
Uh-uh-uh why you do dat?  
I try to be a tough dad, but you be makin me laugh  
Crazy joy, when I see the eyes of my baby boy  
  
I pledge to you, I will always do  
Everything I can  
Show you how to be a man  
Dignity, integrity, honor an  
  
An I don't mind if you lose, long as you came with it  
An you can cry, ain't no shame it it  
It didn't work out with me an your mom

You was conceived in love  
So if the world attacks, and you slide off track  
Remember one fact, I got your back

It's a full-time job to be a good dad  
You got so much more stuff than I had  
I gotta study just to keep with the changin times

See me-I'm  
Tryin to pretend I know  
On my PC where that CD go  
But yo, ain't nuthin promised, one day I'll be gone  
  
Feel the strife, but trust life does go wrong  
But just in case  
It's my place  
To impart  
  
One day some girl's gonna break your heart  
And ooh ain't no pain like from the opposite sex  
Gonna hurt bad, but don't take it out on the next, son  
Throughout life people will make you mad  
  
Disrespect you and treat you bad  
Let God deal with the things they do  
'Cause hate in your heart will consume you too  
Always tell the truth, say your prayers  
  
Hold doors, pull out chairs, easy on the swears  
You're living proof that dreams do come true

"At 17 years old I started runnin' the streets  
Man, I had some fun in the streets  
11, 12, sometimes 1 in the streets  
By 18, I started seeing the sun in the streets  
My mom started trippin' on me  
Like Will, you gotta choose your friends carefully  
Like, I trust you but please call me  
And when you have kids of your own you'll see  
I'ma be here when all your friends won't  
But I was busy hollerin' parents just don't understand  
Now here I am with a family runnin' the lines she ran on me  
We ain't always see eye to eye but Mom, on your principles  
Now I rely, you got me tastin' my toes  
I didn't know  
Momma told me don't go down that road  
But I gotta go where I gotta go  
So take your fool telling me I told you so  
I used to roll hard with this dude named Chuck  
Rollin' in my car with this dude named Chuck  
My Mommy really liked this dude named Chuck  
She thought he was really and polite, Chuck  
And me used to roll out faithfully, inevitably  
You see Chuck, you gon' see me  
Like we on TV, the bosom is the buddy  
Share food, clothes, and money, and hunnies  
Flock like we was players from the NBA  
Still hurts to recall the day I heard him say  
To this girl named Mya  
I was diggin', he told her I was a liar  
Told her I be cheatin' on women  
Breakin' hearts and grinnin'  
He told her her life would be better with him in it  
That's the friend I chose  
I didn't know  
Momma told me don't go down that road  
But I gotta go where I gotta go  
So take your fool telling me I told you so  
Momma used to say, ""Take your time young man  
I ain't always gonna be there , holding your hand  
But, you'll always know exactly where I am  
And when I'm not there in my place the Lord will stand  
Will study the world, only the wise succeed  
And when you're eyes tell lies your heart should lead  
You're gonna do dirt we all gon' sin  
But when you realize it, apologize and never do it again  
Mom told me don't rush to get old  
If you got youth, truth clutched in your hold  
It's like possibilities too much to behold  
An emotional shield from life's blustery cold  
Mom, all this stuff was hard you said was hard  
Childish disregard 'cause my head was hard  
Now, no question opposed, ugh  
I didn't know  
Momma told me don't go down that road  
But I gotta go where I gotta go  
So take your fool telling me I told you so

Will  
Oh you want to hear a story? What kind of story you want to hear baby?  
Willow  
A scary story  
[VERSE 1]  
Oh, ok  
Once upon a time there was a kid who wanted nothin' more than to rhyme  
Almost like he was born in the rhyme  
He thought of his rhymes almost all of the time  
And he fought with his mom  
His school getting caught with his rhyme book  
And he knew he shouldn't of took it there in the first place  
At least he shouldn't of been sittin lookin there in her face with it  
Teacher told him get it out of her class  
Wicked witch, trick told him that's probably why you won't pass  
Now if you shy you won't last but you're new  
So underneath his breath before he left he said I'm a be richer then you  
What you say? She said.  
What you mean? He said.  
Boy don't you play, she said.  
What you mean? He said. Damnit.  
Ten minutes later standin up in the principles office  
Getting handed the phone clammed up cause his father was talking  
And he was pissed he wasn't listening to his son.  
You testing me? You messin up again  
You done boy.  
[CHORUS]  
This is just a story about a young man comin up in the rap game  
A real scary story  
Went from rags to riches it has goblins in it haters and witches. Uh.  
  
[REPEAT CHORUS]  
  
[VERSE 2]  
First thing he did was find somebody to give him some money.  
He wasn't stupid but wasn't using his senses honey.  
The guy's he meant was a little shady, a little funny.  
But they gave him the money so they played the record company.  
It sounds silly but when he grew up in Philly rhymin wasn't what it is today  
Deals wasn't a dime a dozen  
Today every sister, uncle, or mom or cousin gotta record deal  
But for real it wasn't like that then.  
As you could imagine when he started risin to fame and fortune he was  
havin Started antagonizing the guy's he was with  
At the same time he started realizing  
The deal he got from them guys in his eyes didn't fly with size of his hits  
He called a meeting to find a solution.  
He said I'm gettin beat out of my loot  
And I'm not recording no more until we find a solution  
The dude's said we found a solution its this .44  
He ran for the door a little shaken  
But the next day he found a lawyer, told him the situation  
He said I'm breakin this contract for ya  
He said how much the lawyer said I'm a charge you a quarter cause I like you  
Just do me a favor

When the clock struck twelve in the year two g  
Medianoche finally near  
This will be that anthem amongst the cheers  
Just the man to usher it in  
Big Will bringing the heat  
K-Ci bringing the plan  
Ringing it in, waiting for the ball to drop  
That 2000 vault we breaking the lock  
Let hip-hop keep blazing the charts  
May the past keep a warm spot in your heart  
May the future hold more joy then pain  
Hands in the air waiting for confetti to rain  
  
Its here and I like it  
Gonna pack the dance floor  
Rock the dance floor  
  
Here it comes another year  
Come on everyone, new millennium  
Here it comes another year  
Everyone, new millennium  
  
There's a party tonight  
Everybody was drinking  
The house was screaming  
And the bass was shaking  
And it won't be long  
Till everybody knowing at twelve o'clock  
At 12 o'clock  
Say what? Say what? Say what? What?  
  
Here it comes another year  
Come on everyone, new millennium

Too rich (too rich)  
That's what they say  
  
[Verse 1]  
Humble beginnings, rich ass endings  
Pockets on swole, big ass benjies  
Started off losin', man it wasn't choosin'  
Stuck with my nigga's, now we all winnin'  
Rollin' up paper, ball like a Laker  
Top on the building, I'm high as a 'scraper  
What can I say now, cops know my name now  
No time to play 'round, I'm rich and I'm paid now  
Stay on that piece for shit for nigga's that spray rounds  
Hear all the talk, they gon' come see you any day now  
Try not to fade now, try to find a way out  
Nobodies innocent nigga, get down or lay down  
Made so much money but look how I'd paid out  
Don't trust the bank no more so I went and got a safe in my house  
Guess all these diamonds on my wrist, what you blinkin' about  
It's all my money on my mind when I'm thinkin' about

You know I tried the nigga's that said I can't  
They got the right decisions, handle business like a man  
You know I try when people say I should change  
Sometimes I'm done with trying, I'm just trying to be the same

Nigga's still hating, critics still waiting  
Said that I'd change my ways and start catching these cases  
But never said I'd stop counting these faces  
Flyin' new places, buying them cases  
Nigga's want problems, I don't entertain it  
Cause if it's real problems, It's not entertainment  
I'm rollin' a joint up, precise like a painter  
The grind is what made us, the grind is what made us  
Now the nigga's that I grew up with lookin' richer  
Too much turnin' up, the club owners tryin' to censor  
Tatted everywhere my full body full of scriptures  
Pull up in the phantom, paparazzi takin' pictures  
Sellin' so much swag, we should be your swag vender  
Big winner in the club, big cash spender  
Throwin' signs to my man like he a damn pitcher  
Some shit you can't witness, my nigga we been business

In the studio writin' rhymes til the paper crunch  
I'm not the type that you would call em a thug  
But I'm a hustler its all in my blood  
So if its all for the cheese then I'm in it  
My screws kinda loose so I ease to the finish  
I hop up in the coupe feel the breeze while I'm in it  
Blowin' smoke up out the roof from the trees that I'm spliffin'  
Youngin' got the game on lock

You a lame put your brain on pot  
Leave you wet like the rain y'all drop

You're homegirl's texting you, ignoring them  
Hit the weed, giggle a little, then you get horny  
I hit the weed, get on my mission, and then I'm goin' in  
Knowin' damn well they got boyfriends  
Till they get the front door, asked her which floor I'm on  
I'm at the top, polo socks and pajamas on  
She smoke chronic, know the lyrics to all my songs  
It's like I died and went to heaven, me and all my dogs  
That's why we sip champagne till the bottles gone  
Roll weed on ya take the bitches, I don't follow y'all

I can never make up this if I wanted to  
It's real talk what I'm saying to you  
I don't wanna wake up, knowing just one thought of you  
Got me fallen I can't get up (get up)  
So will you co-star with me?  
Cause my life is like a movie  
  
Champagne parties in my hotel  
Her friends don't even smoke, but they diggin' the smell  
Ex-boyfriend ringin' ya cell  
But every effort to save you's to no avail  
Nothin' but starter's on my team nigga coach fail  
And all we do is get high and watch the dough swim  
Relatively fly like a meteor or spaceship  
Party every night, and early morning get wasted  
All the way 100 you others niggas are make-shift  
Roll that rapper weed, you smoke and don't wanna taste it, lets face it  
She wanna fly where the planes is  
Got her testin' out all of my trees, mint-flavors  
She ? the paper  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
We stay smokin' that la-la-la  
Easy rider, joint roller, my 9-5  
You can prolly smell it in the car when we ridin' by  
More like all the way up, we ain't kinda high  
We more than fly, introduce you to the gang members  
That's Taylor, like blood, no gang members  
No names enter, and now you on champagne land  
I'm on an island of hard liquor  
It be fans, joint lit, and guitar pickers  
Goin' nowhere for awhile, I got good snickers  
Now you wanna mingle, heard young single  
Big face chips baby, stack my Pringles  
You call it tight, I say well-fit  
And we ain't takin' no prisoners, now you jealous  
In ya state please make sure the weed great

You can tell by how I roll  
Cause my clique hard and my cup cold  
My tongue slurred cause I'm so throwed  
And I'm wiping sweat from my last show  
And he's TG and I'm XO  
I'm only here for one night

Sing it in my ears, so I can hear what you're saying to me

Smoke anything that's passed to me  
Don't worry 'bout my boys  
I won't need it for what I'm about to do to you  
Bad bitch, girl I think I might get used to you

Look, everything I got on I was made for  
Everything that I got I done came for  
All the shit that you see I done slaved for  
All the cars and the crib, yeah that's paid for  
Need I say more  
Spend so much money on clothes  
Said fuck a store, making my own  
I hope that you're rolling one up while you're singing along  
And know I was rolling one while I was making this song  
Pour out some shots  
You're taking too long

Drop the top in that 69  
Not Motor 1, not old Chevelle  
Can't say things like supposed to feel  
Stacking all of this paper, dawg

Popping champagne cause we made it  
Pack in the Phantom, we faded

Keep it G, you like the sound of it  
Came to spend money, who's countin' it?  
I'm the realest in the drop, just left the dealer  
In this outfit I'm a killer, tell the coppers I ain't innocent  
If it's poppin', then I'm in it

Hear 'em talk but they ain't living my life  
In the dark tryna get in my light  
But chances I don't give 'em guys twice  
Spendin' grands for hoes, this is the high life  
And for the camera's posing this the high life  
Bottles raising for my niggas not here  
I pour out a couple sips  
Blew 'em on the beach, I smoke for you on my trips  
Them days I was younger I knew this life was the shit  
But never like this  
It's so amazing, we ain't gotta duck shots  
We just pour and chase 'em  
Ain't worry bout it, 'cause they gon' hate  
Know where I'm going, look where I came from  
  
Now you got a new place  
You drive a new car  
You smile for the cameras live life like a superstar  
Don't care what they say  
You reach for the stars  
Got everything you always dreamed or thought about  
And everyone knows who you are

Without me you're a dime  
But with me you're a buck fifty, ha ha  
I can get another one quickly  
But I'd rather weight it out  
Take the broken pieces try and fix it  
Or you could let your pride over weigh the right decision  
And I'll be in the sky you can pay your boy a visit

I was doing good way before I met you  
Now you're off the set  
And I'm a let you see the show go on without you  
Take a bow, think about it  
And hopefully we could be friends but I really doubt it  
See you be catching feeling's now and I be catching planes  
The story of my life, you're just another page

Wonder when it gonna be my time

U see I did the right thing  
I stayed up out the gun and knife game  
I knew about the pain it might bring

I chose to smoke blunts just to drown 'em

Hop on in the Chevy, grab my keys and then I'm outtie  
First thing, If it's 'bout that cheese, then I'm about it  
I be stacking up, got no time for niggas hating  
Low we backing up, keep that clean and watch some Daytons  
Cruising down the street, hear my car before it's coming  
Fuck the police, windows down, I'm smoking something  
And my bitch bad, she gon' ride If shit get crazy

Talkin' about they get money, they got expensive taste  
So I put it in her mouth and sent 'em both on their way

Spent a couple hundred thousand in a couple of days  
Smoke a pound in my suite and then come up with a plate  
Bitch came over to my crib and had a comfortable stay  
She feeling my car, she feeling my chain  
She think I'm a star, I'm feeling the same

"Uh, you would have thought that from seeing me going hard  
That that'd motivate these motherfuckers to get on they job  
But instead they hating on what I've been doing  
Having conversations in my face about what I should do for 'em  
What I'mma do keep rolling and dropping weed on 'em  
Pack my bags look like I'm staying for weeks but be gone in the morning  
If the flight is private, we probably should board it  
You see it you like it, I can probably afford it  
If niggas really felt some type of way about the shit I'm doing  
You picked a crazy time to start letting me know  
Cause jealousy and envy that's a trait for mostly bitches  
Not a man so you ain't one if you letting it show  
Now the money like the weed how we letting it grow  
And I ain't holding on to shit I'm letting it go  
Started small but now we all in them bigger game  
All in a bigger plane, ballin' and getting paid  
  
First the love was there  
Then the paper came  
Then the haters came  
But we still rise above  
  
First the love was there  
Then the paper came  
Then the haters came  
But we still rise above  
  
My phone is dead, but I got a contact  
My sharpie paint pen on my Timbo combats  
You talk shit, I won't respond back  
What they gon' get, and you don't want that  
That nigga will forget the deal  
Remember what? get for real  
My whip appeal, my crib is real  
My wrist as well you know...the Richard Mille  
And my grunge nigga, I make her come quicker  
Then rock toe socks, yellow sponge nigga  
I Tebow, for hoes that eat hoes  
Emojis fo' me and my people  
The hoes love me, I'm on they TiVo  
I work they thighs, and they kegels  
Skateboard, I love Chanel  
Retweet me bitch, I'm Pharrell  
  
First the love was there  
Then the paper came  
Then the haters came  
But we still rise above  
  
First the love was there  
Then the paper came  
Then the haters came  
But we still rise above  
  
Yeah, I hustle no muscle  
I'll never be muzzled  
I'm a piece to a puzzle  
I'm Robert Townsend and my words gon' Hollywood Shuffle  
My nigga I move moo, my motivation is moves foo'  
I get up and does do, I evenly do ten things at once  
Multitaskin' super fast and king of tattin' super pimpin'  
House of rollin' run a business while I'm tourin' on you bitches  
Doing features while watching a double feature nigga  
I see you suffering from haterism, get that check  
I take nothin' and make somethin' there's no breaks when the hustle's runnin'  
Ain't dealin' with fakes ain't fuckin' with snakes  
They all in my face now they got what it takes my nigga I'm straight  
So don't reach out cause I peaced out when I reached out  
There's no response like knockin' on an empty house  
Yeah, so I keep on while you peep on what I be on and you're behind  
That's what karma's about  
  
First the love was there  
Then the paper came  
Then the haters came  
But we still rise above  
  
First the love was there  
Then the paper came

Damn who knew all the planes we flew  
Good things we've been through  
That I'll be standing right here  
Talking to you about another path I  
Know we loved to hit the road and laugh  
But something told me that it wouldn't last  
Had to switch up look at things different see the bigger picture  
Those were the days hard work forever pays now I see you in a better place  
  
How could we not talk about family when family's all that we got?  
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side  
And now you gonna be with me for the last ride  
  
It's been a long day without you my friend  
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again  
We've come a long way from where we began  
Oh I'll tell you all about it when I see you again

First you both go out your way  
And the vibe is feeling strong and what's  
Small turn to a friendship, a friendship  
Turn into a bond and that bond will never  
Be broken and the love will never get lost  
And when brotherhood come first then the line  
Will never be crossed established it on our own  
When that line had to be drawn and that line is what  
We reach so remember me when I'm gone  
  
How could we not talk about family when family's all that we got?  
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side

So let the light guide your way hold every memory  
As you go and every road you take will always lead you home

"Yeah  
Ugh  
Ugh  
Ugh  
  
See I've been going on and on forever  
Them haters probably wonder when I'm gone stop, never  
Most of it's been good but I've seen some bad weather  
And niggas watching now, wouldn't even give me an umbrella  
But I ain't tripping, I made a million on my own  
May come to your surprise but I pictured it all along  
When I was sixteen, finna get put out my home  
Now the man make the money, my nigga, my money grown  
And I can do what I what, went form being hated on  
To niggas try to go down the same road I made it on  
Ain't no love lost but ain't no love shown  
So now when niggas call I just don't pick up the phone  
I'm breaking down the weed, put it in the bong  
Blow a hundred racks, put it in the song  
Party every weekend, hardly ever home  
Don't get a chance to see me face to face  
So you have to talk about me when I gone  
  
[Chorus]  
Stay away from the fake or phony (phony)  
Niggas who can't support their role  
So keep hatin' me from the crowd  
Everybody wants to be the star of the show-ow-ow  
The show-ow-ow (ow-ow)  
The show-ow-ow (ow-ow)  
The show-ow-ow (ow-ow)  
The show-ow-ow (ow-ow)  
  
The drinks poured up, weed's rolled up  
And all my jewelery ice age the piece froze up  
I only like to see the hoes who keep their nose up  
Have any nigga in the world but she chose us  
I remember them same hoes ain't even notice us  
Get you to buy a drink than its over cous'  
We back around the time that she sober'd up  
But shit ain't been the same since the limousine showed up  
The best moments of my life  
Never filled this much plastic off of Polo in my life  
Rarely gon' to see, smoking with ya wife  
Plus anything you want I can afford to buy it twice  
It's the way we know, wake up in the morn'  
Like ""where did all my paper go""  
Roll some more weed and get medicated  
Everyday is a holiday so we celebrate it  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Niggas losing their roles  
Can't play they positions (play they positions)  
One day they down for the team (team)  
Next day they missin' (Next day they missin')  
Same ones was all in the front  
Supposed to be there for support (there for support)  
And half the time it's the ones you care for  
Fuck you here for, huh?  
You wanna be a, big shot, only number one  
Everybody wanna be a superstar  
Big shot, only number one  
But everybody wanna be the star though  
They wanna be a big shot, only number one  
Everybody wanna be a superstar  
Big shot, only number one  
But everybody wanna be the star though  
Ugh  
The money come, the money go  
And when it come down to it  
That's something niggas with real money should know  
We partied a lot, and drank  
Now they don't talk to me  
Started off not so great, now I'm on top of things  
  
I guess the difference is we ain't thinking the same  
So if I'm guilty of change, I guess I'm the one to blame  
I see the bigger picture on the wall in the frame  
Spent a couple of days on team making it rain  
I was cool but, I was thinking ocean views  
Polo trunk shades on and boat shoes  
Cantox lick oil, my nigga I ain't slippin'  
You won't star me out, ugh bad transmission  
So if for the better, yeah a nigga different  
That west coast weed, my homie Wiz twistin'  
Mattress money put up 'cause now my money different  
You got a lot to say, but they ain't never tried to listen  
Record all night in the studio in the morn  
Playin' back when we did, now tell me is that wrong  
Crack the Rose, pop a top or two  
And toast to what this hard work got us to

Them haters talking, I keep earning  
Know some will say that life's a bitch  
Well I'ma flirtin' and fuck that bitch for the money and Louie V purchases  
Old folks jock my car 'cause they know just what this is  
Niggas felxin' hard with no bars, they got weak servants  
Keep verses, Mortal Kombat  
Look at my ring, if I ain't ballin' bitch then what you call that  
Nothing but net, ain't back 'cause I never left  
I did everything right nigga better yet  
Rolling bomb for the niggas that's around us  
Something like a contractor building from the ground up  
Now just, oh  
Twist up this weed  
Realize that you are in the presence of a G  
Don't fuck up my paper meaning my cheese  
Or the ones I use to roll up my trees  
Fuck it, you know what I mean

I'm riding round, smoking, my music up loud  
Kinda doin' my thing, no disrespect to the niggas before me  
Some smile up in your face but then they don't on the low  
Now I just stunt on my own  
Now I just stunt on my own  
I'm in a race, and taking the winners place  
No foot on the brakes  
One the best, homie that's what they call me  
It's lonely at the top, got no company so  
Now I just stunt on my own  
Now I just stunt on my own  
  
See me, when I'm alone, wishing they could fuck with me  
My ex calling my phone, wishing she could stunt with me  
But I'm just riding dog, doing a buck fifty  
Stunting like Jet Li, boat houses and Jet Ski's  
Thirty on the flight, ice like the Gretsky's  
My dime piece only recognize the best tree's  
Treat 'em like I don't need 'em boy, you best believe  
You in her face (You in her face)  
I let her breath

From hated on, to the nigga they put cake up on

But now they won't leave me alone  
Used to walk the other way  
But now they all come to my home  
And they calling my phone,  
'Cause my paper is long  
Heard nothing, but they singing my songs  
Get hired up, if they want than I bring them along  
We flying up, no you wont need a ticket at all  
Need a ticket at all  
Tell 'em bitch I'ma ball and I'ma buy a new crib for my niggas 'n' all  
'Cause I remember days we'd sit and picture it all  
Nigga swear I'd leave or pictured I'd fall  
Counting reasons why they hate, your bitch think I'm a star  
Cause we are, young, gifted,  
Not to mention out here making motherfucking millions

Four heads, one forty ounce and a loosie  
And keep dough on the flip, a hoe on the strip  
And roll dick throw on the flip  
Weed clouds thick enough to block the sun  
Cops come, but thugs never drop the gun, understood?  
Far from ya Hollywood  
From day one, I vowed I would keep it in the hood  
From project chicks with hips and slim waists  
From five dollar plates apartment six-eighths

Tragically, that style, deter-iate, rapidly  
Uncompleted missions, throwin' your best known compositions  
You couldn't add it up, if you mastered addition  
Where I come from, gettin' visual is habitual  
De-mon-strate walkin' on hot coal, in rituals  
I splash the paint on the wall, it formed the mural  
He took a look, saw the manifestation of it, was plural  
Rhymin' while impaired, dart hit your garment  
Pierced your internal, streamlined compartments  
Just consider the unparallel advantage  
Of a natural disaster that's impossible to manage

See my wolves eat the bones and we still want more  
We be foaming at the mouth, even, I doubt we leave without eating  
So without reason, pounds are squeezing

But if we run the race like a thug  
We would lose that mind that we made of

You'll be hoping you'd be Spidey, to get away from this  
You be hoping you be whitey when the judge get pissed  
One man, can't uplift the land  
Like Method Man standing on the hands of fans  
See the Captain and Lieutenants, true descendant

Theres a line he don't cross offending the boss  
While of course his one selecting through your head shot

Have you ever caught the hip hop holy ghost  
Man, I mean really, that shit is mad hype  
Especially when you find yourself rhymin' over mics  
I became a wrecker through my amplifier  
Break it down base, treble through my dancer  
That's one new dance, it's to my Black Magic music

"[Chorus]  
Light is shinin' beauty sunshine  
Here comes one-time the ball was so fine  
Heat is blazin' the kids were playin'  
His partner was shady tryin' to slave the babies  
  
Hey yo they didn't know the cop was crooked, he had blow out in  
Brooklyn  
All this while he let the fiends cook it  
The base heads stirred it up, plus they got to blow it up  
Dropped it off in the PJ's and they bigged it up  
Then one day, shit jumped off real crazy  
The middle of a bathroom they find an old lady  
No clothes, half of her tongue, ear missin'  
The killer had to be mad smart, he wore mittens  
Even though her leg was bitten  
Crackheads point the finger at Detective Slick Morris Gittins  
Paleface cop who done popped the desk  
And got the chop on his neck from when he knocked Celeste  
It was a slug, drug, he pressured everybody on the block  
Some niggaz know him as the Godson of Gotti  
And his black partner, he was scared to speak  
He saw how they planted weapons on these kids in the street  
He saw like over fifty bodies in like fifty-two weeks  
He saw his colleague pick up money before leavin' his beat  
They call him desk duty, Robocop  
Younger dudes call him Freddy Krugs from the way he walk on the  
Block  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Heard the disturbance out the window, oh shit they got my son  
Pulled over his Tempo, Brenda dropped the endo  
Had her little nephew with her yo she didn't care  
They always harassed her, until she blew the captain with a razor  
His partner turned red in his waist, Mase done smacked her  
With the walkie, yoked her then slammed her on her face  
He bugged on her like she was drugged, plugged one in her  
The fifth relaxed her like a big thug pistol whipped her  
Heard she was dusted, musta been the way they threw the cuffs on her  
She broke the shits, went and rushed the kid  
Wavin' her hands, she had a half an axe, all in her tracks  
He grabbed her by the air, she broke his jaw it cracked  
More cops arrived, they both bloodied down by the five  
Wildest niggas just smilin' cause it look live  
They gave her forty years in New Orleans, callin me ?  
Shorty was young, by three days had a great bid  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You're just worms in the worst part of the apple that's rotten  
You squirm and you turn from the right, still plottin'  
All slimy cause you stay grimy, petty crimey cat  
You sometime me, don't need to remind me about  
Livin' in the core, with the scramblers in front of the store  
The bum holdin' the door, the mugging no one saw  
We played ball in the alley where dope was shot raw  
And the school they kept flawed, plus the lowest test scores  
Small percentage determined to strengthen they position  
Transformation from critical to, stable condition  
But it still be obstacles on niggas that's optical  
Watchin' you like salt-water sharks that's tropical  
The money was the root and it's the instinct to make it  
With they pockets and fridge naked, many aim to take it  
Whether - hold up, set up, stabbin' or a wet up  
Just to know it was the kid next door fizzucked your head up  
Once he fell short, frequently visit the courts  
And for some, another way out, is music and sports  
That's why I, keep the rhyme just as fly as a shot  
That won the championship, with just oh on the clock

Comfort me through all the damn madness

Sprinkle water on chocolate, butter scotch flowers  
Vapor action, tropical sunshower  
Baby powder, relax, feel for an hour  
Sand suntan, snuggled up snug  
Snowey days, fireplace, oriental rug  
Thugs, lay on the couch, pull it out, perfect balance  
Chemical stimuli, two tokes off the chalace  
Complete silence, what surround us  
Whats the finest, wrapped in cold sheets  
Vanilla apple heat, flutes play jazz music, puffy pillow suites  
Breakfast in bed, early morning sun treats  
Sunset level, suprise sunrise, sail  
Lay on the couch, while I clip your toenails  
Dreams of peaches and cream steam secret spells  
Soft spoken gospel, Barry White acapell  
Violin, good medicine, sound swell

Taste sugar, quiet storm, seasick  
Slowdance drink, like nights over Egypt  
Having, stabbing, calm chilling now we rolling  
Company, ice cream licking now we holding  
Gentle force, warm tingle of the golden  
Open loose, ice cubes, kiss your belly  
Alcohol, palm trees, peanut butter jelly  
Almond twirl, fantastic melodies  
Soon, taste these spoons  
Wiping me with toon, fly wine, quiet storm  
Now it's high noon, raspberry spices  
Cherry breath, drink from the mountain, sip the very best  
Sounds of the shore, every winter is a war  
Paradise life, recipe now pour  
Musicness, model, gentle mental  
Wash away your sorrow, Fantasy Island

Carry you through, the threshold, do my duty  
Happy ending, go to rest Sleeping Beauty

At second hands, moms bounced on old men  
So then we moved to Shaolin land  
A young youth, yo rockin' the gold tooth, 'Lo goose  
Only way, I begin to gee off was drug loot  
And let's start it like this son, rollin' with this one  
And that one, pullin' out gats for fun  
But it was just a dream for the teen, who was a fiend  
Started smokin' woolies at sixteen  
And running up in gates, and doing hits for high stakes  
Making my way on fire escapes  
No question I would speed, for cracks and weed  
The combination made my eyes bleed  
No question I would flow off, and try to get the dough all  
Sticking up white boys in ball courts  
My life got no better, same damn 'Lo sweater  
Times is ruff and tuff like leather  
Figured out I went the wrong route  
So I got with a sick ass click and went all out  
Catchin' keys from across seas  
Rollin in MPV's, every week we made forty G's  
Yo nigga respect mine, or anger the tech nine  
Ch-chick-POW! Wu from the gate now  
  
Cash, Rules, Everything, Around, Me

It's been twenty-two long hard years of still strugglin  
Survival got me buggin, but I'm alive on arrival  
I peep at the shape of the streets  
And stay awake to the ways of the world cause shit is deep  
A man with a dream with plans to make C.R.E.A.M.  
Which failed I went to jail at the age of 15  
A young buck sellin' drugs and such who never had much  
Trying to get a clutch at what I could not, could not,  
The court played me short, now I face incarceration  
Pacin' going up state's my destination  
Handcuffed in back of a bus, forty of us  
Life as a shorty shouldn't be so ruff  
But as the world turns I learned life is hell  
Living in the world no different from a cell  
Everyday I escape from Jakes givin' chase, sellin' base  
Smokin' bones in the staircase  
Though I don't know why I chose to smoke sess  
I guess that's the time when I'm not depressed  
But I'm still depressed, and I ask what's it worth?  
Ready to give up so I seek the Old Earth  
Who explained working hard may help you maintain  
To learn to overcome the heartaches and pain  
We got stickup kids, corrupt cops, and crack rocks  
And stray shots, all on the block that stays hot  
Leave it up to me while I be living proof  
To kick the truth to the young black youth  
But shorty's running wild smokin sess drinkin' beer  
And ain't trying to hear what I'm kickin in his ear  
Neglected, but now, but yo, it gots to be accepted  
That what? That life is hectic

"Yo, first of all son peep the arson  
Many brothers I be sparkin' and bustin' mad light inside the dark  
Call me dough snatcher just the brother for the rapture  
I hand glide, holdin' on strong, hard to capture  
Extravagant, RZA bake the track and it's militant  
Then I react like a convict and start killin' shit  
  
It's manifested the Gods work like appliances  
Dealin' in my cypher I revolve around sciences  
The ninth chamber leave you trapped inside my hallway  
You try to flee but you got clamped by the doorway  
  
No question, I send your ass back, right to the essence  
Your whole frame is smothered in dirt now how you restin'  
While I'll be trapped by sounds locked behind loops  
Throwin' niggaz off airplanes and the cash rules  
  
Everything around too black as you can see  
Swallow this murder one verse like God degree  
Then analyze this soundtrack with satisfaction  
You adapt like a flashback chain reaction

Fuck that, the next big thing, lay this as Hollywood niggas  
Now that's a money thing

I was Dashing through the hood  
Eighteens with the whip, smoke gray  
Leavin' skid marks on five-oh, smokin' all the way  
With my all-star team, bitches see our shine  
Yo son we gotta make that cream whether raps or Nixon times  
  
They call me Rollie, watch me polly with the wide body Dinali  
Packed the bad hottie, rocked enough ice to play hockey  
I swarm like paparazzi, she popped a wheelie on the candy apple Kawasaki  
Everything is sloppy, philosophical for those who copy  
I'll probably splash her tonight, don't block  
Sippin' on Lime Bacardi got me toxy  
Plus the Cali 'dro holdin' me, I'm 'bout to 'scape like the Roxy  
Ever property, Monopoly, big shotti  
Snatch the cream, whether in the concert hall or in the lobby  
Used to be a hobby, got me duckin' Rudy Giuliani  
like I'm still coppin' big eights from papi  
Follow me, whether Mardi Gras' or house party  
It's wild like safari, ain't mean to catch the body  
But had 'em wobbly off the first blow, tryin' to knock me  
I'm known to pump ya blood like the theme song to Rocky  
Kamikaze, might karate chop ya head like a natty dread  
then call myself Collar Ratsi  
Professionally trained, I am for your artery  
I give the autographs but charge for photography  
Not hardly kid, you awkward Godbody  
You'se a carbon copy, just started to rock Wallys  
Spark the broccoli, spas off this ghetto opery  
Or catch the hot seat, you're bawty boy without ya posse  
Seen

Come, come, come  
One for the dough, son  
Give me the reasons  
  
They couldn't get me, watch me move swiftly  
Broke the unmarked fifty with this cabby who was a gypsy  
He stayed tipsy, said he loved his bills crispy  
Drivin' the streets he kept heat on the night, shifty  
Quickly, who ring bells like it's twelve on Sunday?  
While the stage catch shells from forceful gun play  
Mere fact that the track was a fierce counterattack  
All those who couldn't multiply were sent back  
No tanks, low rank, soldiers hittin' the heart  
Tainted the heart of an empire, was torn apart  
Brought to a halt from a front full assault  
The chemist left the lab with undetermined results  
They saw the swordsman sift electrical volts  
The audience threw nuts with loose screws and bolts  
The archives automatically changed ya stiff vibes  
It was layin' in the sip drive from chest five

Cartoons is on, my favorite shit is The Smurfs  
Now I don't slip when I'm down in the dirt,  
cause by this time I done seen life,  
and figured the amount that it's worth  
It's the first, cops is slippin' for work  
Got my niggas all cuffed up, sweatin' like a hooker in church  
This old woman on her way to the church,  
she said the neighborhood's fucked up,  
and we the ones that's makin' it worse  
Now that's fucked up!  
I hit the block hard, Timberlands is scuffed up  
No justice in the system, look around, it's just us  
They tell me only God can judge us  
But they ain't ever met Judge Kufner  
I'm looking at this cracker on the bench  
Don't understand, I only sold crack to pay the rent  
But that's possession with intent  
Player, I ain't stressin', I'm a pimp  
My bitches love the cocktail dressin' with the shrimp

I lost both of my parents, my nigga life sucks  
Us Billy Boys hold toys cause they don't like us  
Raw like the nose on a fiend sniffin' that white stuff  
Moving with the semi, eggplant pennies  
Hoppin' out the Bentley lookin like I just won an Emmy  
Never been a sloucher dog, cause I'm an alpha-  
Male got that product on sale redeem your voucher  
Leader of the gang, I'm Spanky, you Alfalfa

Sincerely doubt ya, and I will house ya  
Posted out in front of your crib just like a scalper

Every time pick up the mic, I put work down  
Cops don't like me cause I live in the murder town  
My high school homies sold crack, through songs  
You can't get right through the team like two wrongs  
Mad criminal minded cream motherfuckers  
Type of subliminal rhymes scheme mothafuckers  
Can't shake the monkey, life is a bitch

A thought with no voice, just a nod and a look  
The contract was took, straight cash, off the books  
A major pawn took a Don, look, he's armed  
With a few black rooks from the heart of the Crook  
Shook ones look while they hung him on Hercules hooks  
They found his body near a shallow brook, escaped on foot  
Switched the look up, out of state, he got the hook up

Yet heavier than weight, when my mind state starts to break, take cover  
Over RZA instrumental, I'm damn near invincible, it's simple

Yo honey-dips, summertime, fine Jheri drippin  
See you on Pickens with a bunch of chickens how you're clickin'

She rocked rope, honey throat smellin' like Impulse  
Your whole shell baby's wicked like Nimrod  
Caught me like a fresh-water scrod, or may I not be God  
Attitude is very rude Boo, crabby like seafood  
It turns me on like Vassey and Lahrule  
They call me Starky Love-hun, check the strategy  
By any means, Shirley Temple cross was done by Billie Jean's  
Black Misses America, your name is Erica, right true  
Lazy eyeball, small piece, six shoe  
Caramel complexion, breath smellin' like cinnamon  
Excuse me hon, the Don mean no harm, turn around again

Ooh baby I miss you, your sweet tender touches  
Take pulls off the dutches, orgasm in my mind state

Bitches paranoia for the sting, who want the most of me  
Only a hard dozen want to be callin' me cousin  
Thirsty for my catalog, baby shoppin' spree you're lovin'

Floatin' past in an alley with the oak dash  
Show the cash, watch it blow in half, it's no fair  
They goin' mad, check their tape recorders and their notepads  
Crabs want to play me close and grab

Curse to the wicked snakes who try to snatch the truth away  
Cursed be the ones who try to take our youth away  
Peace to the black, the brown, the red, yellow and white seed

They tried to snatch up our beats, son and steal our culture  
And German Catholics, whitewashing Roman sculptures  
How dare you try to deny Allah's intelligence?  
Kidnap the truth and destroying the black evidence  
Glory be to the Father, glory be to the Son  
Glory be to the holy one, the holder of creation whoi  
As Jah was in the beginning is now and forever shall be

Big ass in tight denim

But now, get wild similar to Ol' Dirty  
On third time felon just hit with over 30  
No worries, style have 'em so thirsty  
First degree heats are quittin' on me  
Cold turkey, no mercy  
I bring the pain of a hundred migraines  
But a thousand shoutin' my name that's why I came  
But first bring the cash burst, then the outburst  
My surround sound pound ya ear like Jevon Kearse  
I flex muscle outside I find a next hustle  
Trouble with ya here and face the tec-muscle  
Even the best buckle win, I take it to the extreme  
It gets ugly, but it's what a nigga do to get cream  
This life

Root beer reefer, teeth frame, doin' my 1, 2  
Smokin' with a plain Jane trooper  
Excellent with rifles, out in Japan  
In a flight goons switchblade poke out the night boots ?  
Thrusted on a bullet train with chains on, gettin' my train on

And we resonate, energy that shifts in colors  
Bringing MC's punishment, then I'm done with it  
The meter leave way on the fast break, I run with it  
It was not a hobby, but a childhood passion  
That had started in the lobby and was quicky fashioned  
Every line to line, bar for bar is clockwork  
Hazardous and powerful enough to have your block hurt  
Check the total amount of MC's inflicted  
With torture, from moving with work that's restricted  
We criticize producers til they joints are right  
Then acupuncture the track with pinpoints of light

This is my man, Chef, auto, like Grand Theft Auto

He ain't flexing, microphone ripping, heat holding  
Who testing? Rope-a-dope his black lotus  
Can't quote this, chat with the sword tongue  
Duck when the axe is swinging, wild Apache drum  
Crazy Horse kicking his thoughts, he won't quit  
Can't tell 'em nothing, he grown, give the man room  
Space was demanded, beat banging through the speaker  
Voice, heat seek missle, guided at the listener

Yeah, that's my down bitch  
That's my down bitch, anything she do for her man  
If it's lying on the stand, fish frying in the pan  
She a Queen like Liz the third, wicked curves  
On her word, stay still, rocking linens and furs  
While she do it in the sack, jazz music in the back  
Flat blew a nigga back, act two, I'm into that  
Damn right, she the star of my team  
When we stepped on the strip, baby girl, we the heart of the scene  
Whether Brooklyn, Bronx, Manhattan or Queens  
Staten Island, she styling, if not, she's not seen  
Playboy status, every man's lust  
She acting all shy, but she likes handcuffs  
  
[U-God]  
I'm the first on the court, first to hit the dance floor  
The floss in this rap sport, what more can ya ask for?  
Let ya glass pour, Wu-Tang is here now  
All my Independent Women, time to let ya hair down  
Bottles popping, everything is fair ground  
Fresh legs, window shopping, can't help to stare it down  
You'se a starter cuz I chose ya first  
Baby, you'se a starter, where you throw that skirt  
Lady, you'se a starter, where ya hold it down  
Yeah, I'm Cold Blooded, then ya love my style  
This is rush hour traffic, first one to merk off  
It's like clockwork, first to get ya work off  
I'm the workhorse, Killa Bee performer  
Pro darter, starter, not a bench warmer, what?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Outro: kung fu sample]  
You've learned how to kill  
Every moved you've learned is trained to that end  
Yet, we wish to preserve life  
The first thing to learn, is that difference  
Then you can start training with us, from the beginning

ALLAH's the most gracious, he made the universe the most spacious  
Seen and heard in all places, but still appear faceless  
Embraces all races, all caste and all cases  
In every spec of life he's the substance of all traces

The answer to all questions, the spark of all suggestions  
Of righteousness, the pathway to the road of perfection  
Who gives you all and never ask more of you  
The faithful companion that fights every war with you  
Before the mortal view of the prehistorical, historical  
He's the all and all, you searchin for the oracle  
A mission impossible, purely philosophical  
But you call him on your death bed when you layin in the hospital

And as you play all day like the grasshopper who work and toil  
Like armies of ants carrying stones of soil  
Building a home for themselves and storing food  
At night we praise ALLAH and adore the moon  
In sync like the flow of the Nile, the growth of a child  
Only fearin' GOD, we great a ghost with a smile  
That which is spirit is spirit, which is flesh is flesh  
Meaning life has no partnership with death

Yo, I've been highly misunderstood by those who met us  
They had ears of corn and heads of lettuce  
Mentally dead, essentially lead by the false teachings  
And eventually pledge their allegiance  
To that which was against them and exempt them from the truth  
Then juiced them and pimp them to givin them ties  
So the church can rise, while their babies home hungry covered with flies  
Bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz  
Trying to harness the wind  
ALLAH's the father from without and within  
On Christ return, who will announce him?  
Every tree is numbered, but who can count them?  
The name of all things on this world, who can pronounce them?  
ALLAH is the father of all, why do you doubt him?

The heart is the general, the eyes are the scouts

The wrist must be strong and the fingers powerful  
Fast, high kicks, a good firm stance  
Avoid the enemy's strong points

"After laughter, comes tears  
  
Yo check yo yo, check the script  
Me and the gods get it ripped  
Blunts in the dip, forty dogs in my lip  
Had a box, 'Boom Boom' the bass will blast  
We was laughing, at all the girls that passed  
Conversation, brothers had begin to discuss  
(Hey yo, Ra, remember that kid ya bust?)  
Aw yeah, he ran, but he didn't get far  
Cause I dropped him, heh heh heh heh heh ha!  
Not knowin', exactly what lied ahead  
My little brother, my mother sent him out for bread  
Get the Wonder, it's a hot day in the summer  
Didn't expect, to come across, a crazy gunner  
""Hey Shorty, check it for the bag and the dough""  
But he was brave, looked him in the eye, and said ""No!""  
Money splattered him, BOW! then he snatched the bag  
In his pockets, then he jetted up the Ave.  
Girls screamin', the noise up and down the block  
(Hey, Rakeem!) What? (Your little brother got shot!)  
I ran frantically, then I dropped down to his feet  
I saw the blood, all over, the hot concrete  
I picked him up, then I held him by his head  
His eyes shut, that's when I knew he was  
Aw man! How do I say goodbye?  
It's always the good ones who have to die  
Memories in the corner of my mind  
Flashbacks, I was laughin' all the time  
I taught him, all about the bees and birds  
But I wish I had a chance to sing these three words  
  
After laughter, comes tears  
  
Me and my man, my ace big Moe from the shelter  
Bout to hit the skins, from this girl named Thelma  
Now Thelma had a rep, that was higher than her neck  
Every girl from Shaolin dissed her respect  
We was stimmy, you know how it is when you're blitzed  
Three o'clock in the morning, something gots to give  
Moe said he'll go first, I said I'll take next  
Here, take this raincoat, and practice safe sex  
He seemed to ignore, I said be for real  
She's not even worth it, to go raw deal  
A man's gonna do what a man's gonna do  
He got butt-naked and stuck the power you  
Twenty minutes went by, my man went out, without a doubt  
I'm not pumpin' up, I am, airin' you  
Hey yo, he came out laughing with glory  
I'm surprised, he's still livin', to tell his story  
But he carried on, with the same old stuff  
with Stephanie, like a whammy, he pressed his luck  
Both tried to be down with O.P.P.  
Ain't nothin' wrong but he got caught with the H.I.V. now  
No life to live, doc says two more years  
So after the laughter, I guess comes the tears  
  
After laughter, comes tears  
After laughter, comes tears

Snowy night, fiends basing  
A Raisin in the Sun was amazing  
The joint on the dresser, a gauge went off  
Jumped up, fish tank, it fell and they stuck  
They shot her cousin LaVon, he owed a buck  
Willie was awful, pulled out the ratchet, let off two  
Grits fell on his leg, Kiana ripped the cold bowl  
He violent, an Island nigga with the talent  
Of six killas who just came home, from straight wilding  
Robbing everything in Macy's, Lacy, short haircut  
With long arms, who fuck niggas, got four babies  
Yvette jabber her, slapped her wig off, ran in the crib  
She did the dumb shit, my nigga then clapped her  
Lester, smoked Chester sister, Vest, I heard it was a mess  
They ripped the apple out her throat, blessed her  
Hungry hyenas from Medina, all eight trained us  
Who got reluct', think fast, and blast from Beamers

I brought my bitch out to Pathmark, she's pushing the cart  
Headed to aisle four, damn I got milk on my Clark's  
That's what I get, not focusing, from hitting that bar  
My mouth dried, need plenty water quick, I feel like a shark  
In the aisle, busting them paper towels and wiping my Wally's down  
  
I stood up to face a barrel, he's holding a shiny pound  
It's him, he want revenge, I murdered his Uncle Tim  
I sold him a bag of dope, his wife came and copped again  
That bitch is crazy and uh, she brought her baby  
She knew I hard the murders, a smack, it killed her man though  
Now I got his fucking nephew gripping his gat, you'se a bitch...  
You better kill me... you know you're booty...  
You pulled your toolie out on me... motherfucker!  
First thought was to snatch the ratchet, said fuck it and fucking grabbed it  
I ducked, he bucked twice, this nigga was fucking laughing  
I wrestled him to the ground, tustle, scuffle, constantly kicked him  
He wouldn't let go the joint so I fucking bit him  
Shots was whizzing, hitting Clorox bottles  
Customers screaming, then the faggot ran out of hollows  
I had to show him what it's all about  
Next thing you read in the paper ""A man who came to kill, gets knocked out""

He killed Kase and now he hassling us

When the moon has lost its light.  
And the stars no longer bright  
And no longer can we share, the love that was never there.  
(Ain't no need to cry girl. Its gonna be alright)  
  
Girl don't you cry.  
(Girl don't you cry)  
Please dry your eyes  
All you ever been was faithful in my life.  
So I apologize  
I hope the future brings us back together.  
At least that's how I thought it would be.  
At least that's how I thought it would be.  
(Yo, Neville brothers. What was her name)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Right about now if you are in dance,  
I want you to hold your girl real tight.  
We got the Neville brothers in the house tonight.  
Along side Wyclef, you know how we do it.  
I want to apologize to you. I never wrote a love song. This is my first one.

"The preacher's son with the rebel music  
Rebel music, put the peace sign up now  
Rebel music, all my gangs put the peace sign up now  
Rebel music, everywhere put the peace sign up now  
Rebel music, hold on, listen  
  
Tell the DJ turn the music up  
Gangsters in the club, everybody thugs  
Me I play the walk, sipping on the Guinness  
Cause in reality we are the same and it's  
Just society they want to see me  
Flesh on the concrete, sold a perfect story  
The mystery is waking up in misery  
The music industry brainwash celebrities  
Girls sleep sexy, they wake up with a monster  
Have no idea that their face was a piranha  
Word from the wise I can see through the fog  
Reason why they rob cause they got no job  
  
But I woke up in the morning, sexy, yawning  
Feel like it's gonna be a good day  
No war on the street, no way, today  
Everybody kick back like a holiday, aight  
You shine, I shine and  
The whole world looking like a gold mine  
You get yours and I'll get mine  
And we'll help each other make it through the bad times  
  
When they see me they ask me  
Will there ever be another Fugees  
I say I don't know but hope the trio  
Don't do like ? ? then ? on Sadaam though  
But on CNN they saw the same  
Little kids getting shot at close range  
To Babylon, we don't want no war  
I'm a send a message in a bottle to the White House, Lord  
These are the words from the master  
So don't you wait till the day after  
Until then you can catch me in the sixes  
Just pumping Bob Marley rebel music now  
  
But I woke up in the morning, sexy, yawning  
Feel like it's gonna be a good day  
No war on the street, no way, today  
Everybody kick back like a holiday, aight  
You shine, I shine and  
The whole world looking like a gold mine  
You get yours and I'll get mine  
And we'll help each other make it through the bad times  
  
Children, imagine a world with no racism  
No, no homeless in Grand Central Station  
Boys and girls going to schools with no tools  
Life is so beautiful but until then it will be  
Rebel music, rebel music  
Rebel music, put the peace sign up now  
Rebel music, all my gangs put the peace sign up now  
  
Uh, can these devils fool us son, not now ? done  
We're a generation of thugs, you can't play with us  
We've been lied to, enslaved and beaten up  
We're immune to what you call pain, it's nothing  
We're not scared of dying or afraid of guns  
Born in the USA, nah, can't blame us  
Our DNA's foreign to them  
We kings of the planet Earth, Gods if you will  
Yo, cash be my ?, it's about to get stupid  
These niggaz trying to stop our plans, peace to it  
I never meant to cause him pain and he knew it  
But he was trying to kill me and he blew it  
  
But I woke up in the morning, sexy, yawning  
Feel like it's gonna be a good day  
No war on the street, no way, today  
Everybody kick back like a holiday, aight

"[Intro]  
Yeah I wanna dedicate this to everybody that love hip hop music  
Cause without hip hop music I wouldn't be here today  
Preacher's son, yeah  
  
[Verse 1]  
Imagine if Biggie and Pac never got shot  
And they both still were rulers of hip hop  
And Puffy and Suge was roomates from college  
And Big L never got found in the alley  
Nas and Jay-Z they were still homies  
Squash the beef with Ja Rule and 50  
Benzino shook hands with Eminem  
And on the same record I heard Eve, Fox and Kim  
And sometimes when I dream, that's when I wake up  
I kinda hoped that The Fugees didn't break up  
And when they walked into the studio I prayed they didn't spray  
Cause I miss that scratch from Jam Master Jay (Whoa oh oh!!!)  
  
[Chorus]  
Shots go off, mother's cry  
Death since rise, homicide  
Black on black crime needs to stop  
Y'all can't blame it on hip hop  
Cause what we say is what we see  
What we see is reality  
The ghetto's the ghetto you got them livin in sorrow  
Soon they won't live to see tomorrow  
  
[Verse 2]  
Imagine if Big Pun was still alive  
I could see Fat Joe screamin Terror Squad  
Imagine if there were still four survivors still in Destiny's Child  
And TLC never lost they Left Eye  
Imagine Refugees never needin a passport  
And John Forte never at Newark Airport  
Million Man March, man, that was a start  
Now I need a million more to meet me at Central Park  
When the revolution start y'all 'gon have to play this  
Imagine Slick Rick not gettin deported (Whoa oh oh!)  
  
[Chorus]  
Shots go off, mother's cry  
Death since rise, homicide  
Black on black crime needs to stop  
Y'all can't blame it on hip hop  
Cause what we say is what we see  
What we see is reality  
The ghetto's the ghetto you got them livin in sorrow  
Soon they won't live to see tomorrow  
  
[Verse 3]  
In the club never though Shyne shot the gun  
But in the limosine JLO had to run  
Paparazzi snappin shots through the mirror  
That's when I saw a smile from Princess Diana  
Back and forth and forth and back  
Like Miss Aaliyah man do I miss her  
The war goes on with The ROC and The Lox  
Murder INC, G- Unit it's a fight to the top  
Stop! We lost too many soldiers like Freaky Tah  
While they get the cover of a magazine who got to die

Shots go off, mother's cry  
Death since rise, homicide  
Black on black crime needs to stop  
Y'all can't blame it on hip hop  
Cause what we say is what we see  
What we see is reality  
The ghetto's the ghetto you got them livin in sorrow  
Soon they won't live to see tomorrow

If you ain't treatin' your girlfriend right  
Trust me when I tell you this  
One day you won't be missed  
Someone will replace your kiss  
You want to be hardcore  
Like the rapper Jadakiss  
Or a thug like me will be up in your house  
Cookin' breakfast in the morning  
I know you heard these words before  
But you never heard em quite like this  
You gon' find yourself livin' all by yourself  
Who woulda ever thought wit a stranger she would share her wealth  
Now a stranger like me is lyin' under her sheets  
This is a warning red alert emergency  
If you can't find your girl that means she's here wit me  
She said you had an argument  
So I brought her roses  
You know what comes next when the door closes  
You don't like her smile  
So you treat her foul  
You only give her attention when I'm on the prowl  
And now your guilty conscience got you actin' wild  
And now you want to flip mode like you Busta Rhymes

This is a warning red alert emergency  
If you can't find your girl she's at work wit me  
Yo we eatin' brunch while you havin' lunch  
You don't even call to see what she wants  
You don't like her smile so you treat her foul  
You only give her attention when I'm on the prowl  
And now your guilty conscience got you actin' wild  
And now you want to flip like you Busta Rhymes

This is a warning  
It's a radar warning  
My dogs I'm talking to you right now  
You need to hold her and console her  
Never, never, never be afraid to tell her that you love her

Get on the phone and call your girlfriend right now  
You shoulda listened to her  
Shoulda listened to her  
You shoulda listened to her  
Shoulda listened to her  
Oh, you should listen to her  
Sometimes you should listen to her  
Take her out for dinner  
Shoulda listened to her  
Take her to the movies  
Shoulda listened to her  
She lookin groovy  
Shoulda listened to her  
That kinda girl ready  
Shoulda listened to her  
Yo you should listen to her  
Shoulda listened to her  
Sometimes just listen to her  
Shoulda listened to her

Hey kids, gather around, it's Wyclef and Melky Sedeck  
I got a story to tell, heeeeeeere we go  
  
Sit right back and hear a tale of a hustler 'round my way  
He used to clock around the block from where my grandma stayed  
Black BMW with rims to match, windows bulletproof  
One night, he jumped out the car  
and caught a bullet in his bubblegoose  
He caught a bullet in his bubblegoose

Hey yo, hey yo, my pen's in my hand, what should I write next?  
Oh yeah, and if you don't know, success brings stress  
I'm vexed, my phone rings, collect call from Jeff  
The operator say, ""If you accept, say yes""  
""Yes, what's the deal, son?""  
""Yo, I got bad news""  
Yo, by the tone of his voice, I heard the ill street blues  
""The friends will make you, then too can break you  
They plan an execution like Fu Man Chu""  
""Who?""  
""You know the character from channel 5 kung-fu (wahoo)""

""A million and a half or he won't be back""  
""So meet me by the Brooklyn Bridge, 12:00 sharp""  
""If not, at the funeral, you gotta play the harp""  
Yo, why they wanna start and make me play my part?  
Don't they know like Sting, I can turn this murder into art?  
I jumped into my car, there's gotta be a joke

On your wig transition?""

But all you screwed mugs got me wearin' black gloves  
You up in my face, I see the fear in your eyes  
You wanna feel the pain like a grown man gettin' circumcised  
Shalom, shalom, pardon my left  
But my right hand's on your throat, massaging you to death  
You provoke the cycle, call Michael  
You're lookin' in the mirror, well, I'm in your window, oh oh  
You hear me Urkel, your blood will turn purple  
Like the colour, you holler, ballin' for your mother  
No-one hears you even though you knock  
You used to walk around the block with the daily rock  
Things done changed since your spark got hot  
Now you got your knot wocked with your very own glock

Wyclef stuck the bank at mid-day  
And took all of Sony money, in a black van he got away  
I just got a call from Tommy Mottola  
He said forget about it ""oh my word""  
So I held John Agrassia, at gunpoint  
He's shook, callin' Donny Aiena, while smokin' a joint  
I said, 'Who's the informer?' They say, 'Michael Malden'  
I had to take him out ""Three the hard way!""

Aiyyo  
What y'all thought I was too busy writin songs with Whitney Houston  
Cuz ""My Love's Your Love"" will be my slugs wit blood  
For any thug that wanna bang and play orangutang  
Find yourself in the river with the rest of them  
Wake up, wake up, I'm in a nightmare dream  
Where I found myself loadin magazines after magazines  
Ski mask on my face, gun on my waist  
Fine pens shakin in my hand as I write this next line  
You look strange, shootin victims at close range  
And saw his vein burst from his neck, as I snatched his chain  
Is this a Bible, I used to read the Gospel  
Until I got betrayed by one of my twelve disciples  
Which one, look through the crowd son  
You could spot the traitor wit a tatto on his arm  
The symbol is a microphone, an intellectual  
A wannabe Rakim, but too extraterrestrial  
I heard he's lethal and I'm too rusty to battle him  
Me being rusty is like Biggie not being ""Born Again""  
It never happen, watch who you call fam  
On MTV, he painted himself as the tin man  
Predicted platinum, way before it happened  
So that's why when you ship gold, you only sold aluminum  
  
And now you wanna tell everybody I messed up your record?  
C'mon!  
  
However you want it, you don't want it, cuz when you get it it hurts  
Your body carried out the church

However you want it, you don't want it, cuz when you get it it hurts  
Your body carried out the church  
Mom, she be cryin holdin on to her purse sayin... (oh...)  
  
You a thug? You aint a murderer, just an undercover caligula  
Cuz when you saw the luger became silent like Caesar  
Enough of this rap stuff, Sedeck take his watch  
If I wasn't rappin, I'd take that stash in your left socks  
Don't make me raise my voice cuz I'm masterin a coo  
So, and besides when they find you you'll be bones  
Mom say watch my peers, hangin like chandeliers  
Orderin Don P, you couldn't pay for one beer  
Perpetratin, a fraud, oh god, you aint hard  
Take thirty of y'all to murder one kid on the boulevard  
You want Wyclef Jean, bring your same thug guys  
Here's my advice, leave the ring with your bride  
Cuz you aint comin back no more  
We gon send you to a vacation for two, with crabs on the seashore  
You freeze up, hold up I really thought you was psychotic  
Is that tears in your eyes? You cryin for your life  
Kid you tellin me what you did, you didn't wanna do  
Watch what you say on record cuz it might come true  
  
However you want it, you don't want it, cuz when you get it it hurts  
Your body carried out the church  
Mom, she be cryin holdin on to her purse sayin... (oh my baby!)  
They shoulda took me first

Should I take them? Should I wait?  
Should I take them? Should I wait?  
Should I take them? Should I wait?  
I say ""No Woman, No Cry"" like I should own a piece of the estate  
But at the tribute they didn't invite me  
So I put in a call to Halis Alassi  
He said be easy, aint no need to bust a shot (BLOW! BLOW! BLOW! BLOW!)

For a lying ass but yo forgive us in a while  
And I'm sorry, never let me forget that I'm your child  
While I'm locked up in this basement staring eye to eye with Satan

The kids raise themselves, all kind of temptation  
Flowers and candles decorating all the pavements  
No, the perpetrator ain't seeing no arrangements  
Nobody cares about the feelings of the poor

I just pass it on to folks with no boundaries  
Got a long road ahead of us, AIDS already gettin' us  
Now we got stars, how many will there be left of us

I got no choice but to sling crack  
  
Yo who you pushin' weight for  
Dog I ain't no rat  
Cause rats get found in the back of garbage trucks  
With they mouth taped up  
Lookin' like sittin' ducks  
Well you don't look like a sittin' duck and your mouth ain't taped up  
What more small the market, Clef  
You get stuck up  
With what  
From a fiend  
I just bought a twenty-two  
Now it's funny you should say that  
Cause the gun looks bigger than you  
Now get your ass back in the house  
Shut up!

You gave me the voice to speak, God  
Speak God  
Wyclef Jean bout to hit the streets hard  
Peace God  
Peace  
You gave me the voice to speak, God  
Masquerade, my message to the streets, y'all  
  
Yo peace God  
These words came from a revelation  
Whether you free or you going through incarceration  
Inhale, exhale herbal meditation  
Put the fire arms away  
Cause we don't want no confrontation  
Not me, I'm talkin bout you jerk  
Cause when you die your life ain't even worth the paperwork  
So, peace God, even through war we bring peace  
And after the blood shed then your first son deceased  
And you will understand I'm the beginning of the end  
The alpha, omega, the present, and the future  
So hold on to your Winchester  
Cause the hollow tip penetrate lead through your polyester  
Peace God, even though we ice the wrist  
Guzzle the fifth  
Protect us with a crucifix, Lord  
And bless me with an extra clip  
So just in case one jam release my twin from my waistband  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Aye, yo peace God  
I ain't tryin' to see the graveyard  
But in this game of life I was dealt the wrong card  
I wasn't born this way it just came to be  
Sellin' crack through a alley where the fiends rally  
Where the dealer was the president  
And the fiend was the voter so they voted for the government  
And stick ups was only natural  
It seem every other day a new gun pointed at you  
Peace God  
Yo only God got the answer  
And sorry bout ya mom dyin' of cancer  
But congratulations, I heard you no longer a runner  
You a big man now, the black Tony Montana  
But watch out cause I heard wealth bring envy  
Trust me I did sing for the Kennedies  
Until we meet again feel my words through my pen  
And stay pure in the city of sin

"Intro  
Yea, oh!  
Check me out, look  
It goes love, hate, pleasure and pain  
Four albums in the can and I'm still in the game (what up?)  
And last album, they don't like me to tell this  
Debuted at number one and sold more records than Elvis (shut up!)  
That's what they telling me, switch up your melody  
Through with misdemeanors, they trying to give rappers felonies  
So they can lock us up one at a time  
But true writers stay free in every one of our lines  
And if you not feeling I'm the cream of the crop  
I'll knock rappers off your list 'til I get to the top!  
Still you looking at a man that's financially stable  
Only nigga getting checks cut from four different labels  
That Pillsbury dough, women poke my guts  
Still I walk around the streets like I'm broke as fuck  
So if you see me in your town and I appear to be moody  
It's cause I'm thinking 'bout plans that's bigger than Serena booty  
Me and shaka still starving and looking for meals  
And heads up! Ludacris is almost out of his deal  
I'm over ten million sold, every album is crack  
And for now I'm bout to carry def jam on my back  
Mad rappers I hear you talking way down at the bottom  
Though I make big money, still handle small problems  
The rambling at the mouth, I don't play that shit  
I'm the best and I ain't really got say that shit!

I'm fat with the ink pen  
Like Ali Boom Bayay  
Okay I'm on my second wind  
Used to roll dice when the love was on my side, man  
Four, five, six walked away with the Grammy  
Seen many blocks turn to the Twilight Zone  
D.A. on a case like Sherlock Holmes  
My old high school sweetheart started sniffin' a bone  
For the right bag she deep blow deeper than the baritone  
I caught you off guard, this verse is unexpected  
Check it  
Like when I rhyme don't big punch wreck it  
Check it  
I got a swagger that cut any rapper mind over matter  
Lyrical dagger like alcohol I got pull your liver  
  
Quiver, shiver body temperature can found in Hudson River  
Deliver a message to your miss you won't be commin' over  
And if you on a street tonight  
See that refugee local  
We beam around the world like satellite

It's the rock and roll boys, turn your radio down

It's a riot... Trouble (comin') again, your body's getting nervous

You see we're trouble (comin') again, your body's getting nervous  
See we're trouble (comin') again, body so unconscious

Come rock with me  
I got the music on the block with me  
Come chill on the spot with me

Yeah you're right we got enough for everyone  
So get all your friends and your families and come along  
Move to the beat that's all we do  
We got Jerusalem  
Everyday we offer praises like King Soloman  
  
Don't be nervous  
I'm your guardian angel, I know you're nervous

Oh  
Oh

The matterings of all matter  
Masters and their extended batters  
Internet intelligence firm  
Investments for the natural world  
Their divestments  
Truth is knowledge  
Although bipolar if it's attainment is equitable  
Man's mirrors face the flesh  
But hide the spirit  
In opposite worlds  
Vision can only be attained universally  
Lamps of varied sizes and shapes carrying different shades  
All having the propensity to illuminate  
Let's ruminate on realization  
That the means is the end  
The earth's water is mirroring the stream of consciousness  
The dead being reborn  
As flowers smiling through the battlefields

He looked at me, he says ""Son, man, you're too young kid""  
""When you get older now and you understand that""  
""I let you get one kiss from Ms. Mary""

She's homegrown and you can grow her in her backyard  
She's homegrown and you can hold her in her backyard  
If she allows you to you can roll her up  
She's homegrown and you can kiss her in her backyard  
She's homegrown - I like to be with you Ms. Mary - in your backyard

I'm homegrown and you can grow me in your backyard  
I'm homegrown and you don't need to worry for my backyard

She used to be the sweetest girl ever

She wears a dress to the T like the letter  
And if you make it rain she will be under the weather  
She used to run track back in high school  
Now she tricks on the track right by school  
She takes a loss cause she don't wanna see her child lose  
So respect her, I'll pay up for the time used  
And then she runs to the pastor  
And he tells her there will be a new chapter  
But she feels no different after  
And then she asks him  
Where my money at?

So tell me, what should I do when she gets off the phone?

God says, ""Repect her, her man's in the pen""

who? The son of Sam!""  
I said you've got this wrong, I never sung your girl a love song  
He drew for his weapon, there's no more conversation

No ambulance, no police sirens to interrupt my silence, aha ? dinero  
Means I work hard and have a warm day  
Playin' my guitar, I'm sitting on the beach  
I'm sippin' margaritas as the water splash my feet  
It's too hot in New York I had to get away  
So here's a ticket, meet me on the beach in the shade  
  
When I was young they called me Robin Hood  
'Cause I stole from the rich and I gave to the poor  
Went back home, mama whooped on my ass  
Said I'll be damned if I let you live like that  
Meanwhile next door neighbors jumpin'  
Beatin' on his wife while the kids were watchin'  
Later that day we was out on the porch  
And fantasize we was out of New York, we woke up in  
  
Three nights in Rio De Janeiro with no sounds of buses  
No ambulance, no police sirens to interrupt my silence, aha ? dinero

So here's a ticket, meet me on the beach in the shade  
  
I'm in your hood like your neighbors were Spiderman  
I'm in the club 'fore I entered the stadium  
I bring the vibe like the days of the Tribe  
Before I had the fame I was servin' the fries  
So who better to know about a nine-to-five  
Wakin' up at five with the cold in my eyes  
Now my daddy, he can rest in peace  
From the belly of the beast to the sunniest beach, let's go  
  
Three nights in Rio De Janeiro with no sounds of buses  
No ambulance, no police sirens to interrupt my silence, aha ? dinero  
Means I work hard and have a warm day  
  
Playin' my guitar, used to daydream at the stars  
Prayin' if I ever make it, I'm gon' help my family make it  
From the streets of Brooklyn, to the Jersey ? ?  
I'm a stand on stage and play this guitar till I fall  
Santana, let me get some help  
Santana, let me get some help  
  
Eh, this one goes out to those who work, follow and ?

Let's talk this over  
Now see I heard everything that you told her  
But it's gon' take more than words  
For you to be a father, uh-huh  
Responsibilities of a man

What if she knew that you chose  
Another over her mother, aowwww!

You've learned a house is not a home  
When you're living all alone, and you want back home

Wait a minute girl! You're my joy, happiness that you bring  
Turn the fall back to spring girl, you're my bling  
You a hip-hop song I heard for the first time time  
Studied all the words to the rhyme  
You're my life, without you there's no sun, there's no moon  
There's no stars, shinin in the ni-iight

But if I give you a chance, would you show me you care  
Be a man, no matter what the circumstances  
Ahhhow!

A grown man ain't supposed to cry  
So why does water fill my eyes when I hear your voice

You've learned a house is not a home

Intro:  
  
Listen you fuckers, you screwheads  
Here's a man who won't take it anymore  
A man who stood up against  
The skunk, the kunts, the dogs, the fill, the shit  
Here is some one who stood up  
Here is...  
  
Yeah! this is it for anybody usin bodies  
presents, Xzibit movin at the speed of life  
Yeah! check it  
  
Verse One:  
  
It took a long time comin but we waited  
Xzibit went from underated  
To now most antcipaded  
never would of thought that I would rock your set  
And get love and respect without no special effects  
Only the rugged ruff shit that the hard rock need  
Lyrics must contain more then just clothes bitches and weed  
thinkin' how you like to see the next man bleed  
Tryin to glority greed  
Livin life at ridiculuos speed-indeed!  
The main goal to achieve, is to succeed  
Have it laid out for your seed  
But the world gets colder every day by day  
Physically, mentally gettin drained by L.A.  
Trying to find piece of mind  
is like trying to find a gold mine  
it just won't happen  
no time for relaxin  
Real soldiers of fortune  
the front line of the action  
So never show a nigga what you packin'  
""You know what i'm sayin'?""  
It's too much weight to be juggling  
who do you picture when you think about struggling  
Kids in the bed, no food stomach bubbilin  
Niggas in the E-class heavy drug smugglin  
  
Chorus:  
  
Movin...yeah!  
yes movin...  
At the speed of life  
  
Verse Two:  
  
And plus I feel that no style is darker than mine  
There was a time it was all about beats and rhymes  
But nowadays the blind just follow the blind  
and when I die!  
Niggas still recite these lines  
to rock the heads, waterbeds citys and towns  
Bringin strength to the masses that be holdin it down  
the underground! to upper echelon and beyond  
Xzibit rock and roll the streets like a vagabond  
Nigga want to trip you gettin dissed like a blond bitch  
mackin to Farrakhan, I run game like a marathon  
It's here today then tomorrow it's gone  
It's the law of the land  
a straight modern day babylon!  
  
Chorus:  
  
Movin...yeah! yeah! like this  
Like this...at the speed of life  
Ah! Bring it live, yeah!  
  
Verse Three:  
  
Xzibit lookin at the earth through wide angles  
I found a stairway to heaven in a city of lost angels  
Where small situations turn to altercation  
with a heavy ass price  
'cause niggas don't fight no more!  
before hip hop was all about drama  
anything for a dollar before Kane fucked Madona  
Xzibit maintain and stayed bent like a comma  
Just me and my bottle  
we shall lead not follow  
Emcees be full of shit  
but they style be hollow  
it seems you've bitin off more  
than you can possibly swallow  
just a day in the life of a man named X  
only blunt and latex for the oppisite sex  
you see niggas comin through to smoke and pay respect  
ever since fifteen, I been ready for anything  
whatever they bring in any shape, form or fashion  
I live to the fullest and rip rhyme with a passion  
but in the mean while if worse comes to worst  
bust a round or bust a verse whatever comes first  
Yeah! we got it locked down tight  
Xzibit bring truth to the light  
shit is movin at the speed of life  
  
Chorus:  
  
Movin...  
At the speed of life

"[Chorus]  
I was on the block picturing blocks at fifteen  
I remember underage drinking at sixteen  
Then my nuts in Cali banging at seventeen  
Now I got everything, bitch, I got everything  
  
My back was to the wall, visited all, after all, all I had was me  
Just tenacity, so we all leave with a sense of sweet  
Then everything I write around got a cotton seat  
Fuck y'all dry, saw off and done rapidly  
Partner, now let's be honest, ain't got no good intentions  
The upper tune is the dudes moving in my position  
But I'm a heavy, wait humble, hitting the heavy bag  
Waiting for the day I stumble across your fucking ass  
Instead I push the work in, chin up and chest out  
Picking the shit up where I left off  
You went soft intention too tenant to deal with the Los Angel  
I admit it, I bull shit and gave you the wrong angle  
Now I have a seat at my table, let me do you the business  
Diversify you millions, you can leave off the entrance  
Make every revenue street flood to where it took me  
And make that money stack higher than giraffes  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I used to have a Glock that I would shot to at backpack  
So it will leave no shells at the scene  
Where I was getting my kid back  
Yeah, this for the homie whack, rolled to and chopped up  
On hard to make the west defined a united fund  
Beard big, light it up, waiting on that vending truck  
So I can crush the corner, welcome to California  
Where people fake it 'till they make it  
Or take it with their hand gun  
Take your chances, swing, try to land one  
Now you're in the box like a sand some, I march to the madness  
My symphony deliver something classic  
Either you ain't glad or you blast it, jumped in or dragged it  
Either way, you got to salute the flag, who you want it with?  
I acknowledge honest with whole heart and integrity  
People keep telling me I'm about to catch a felony  
Stage presence, reminiscent of my flash back  
Gave my girl a son and my last name  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Motherfucker, I live in room that look like a drive-in  
When I open my eyes a bunch of bitches play violins  
Nothing but respect when I walk to the lights in  
Because I kill everything, bitch, I kill everything  
Nothing ever compares with the spring of a free mind  
Find the most dangerous weapon ever acquired by mankind  
Using to fight for your freedom and oppress your oppressors  
You mold them and lead them, fuck the positive message  
This is a lifetime allegiance, boy, you're down to the essence  
There's no payment for passage, my immaculate presence  
Make every revenue street flood, look where it took me  
And make that money stack high and you run a pussy  
  
[Chorus]

"
"Yeah yeah  
Look, you could've got away but your response wasn't quick enough  
Can't preserve life 'cause the best wasn't thick enough  
Teflon, Napalm, Homicide scenes  
These are a few of my favorite things!  
But I ain't Mary so ain't a damn thing poppin  
Only death disease and a whole lota palm trees  
Not only for mics, Xzibit is a way of life  
Until my death so I celebrate success  
Best of the best wouldn't test these waters with a yacht  
Sendin' sixteen shots across your parking lot  
All up on your proximity drinking Hennessy  
Holdin down ground like the Statute of Liberty  
So nobody ever can rush my spot  
And the torch stay lit so I ain't worried about shit  
It ain't where your from it's al about how you represent!  
Unfamiliar faces better know who your fuckin' with

Eyes may shine, Teeth may grit

And you still won't step  
So what's next?  
All of a sudden you ain't sayin nothin  
[You Better off buckin yourself]  
[You need to stop frontin]  
  
I'm only comin' through when it's time for collection  
Xzibit forever nasty, spread like infection  
Ain't no protection ever made by man to withstand this punishment  
In other words runnin' shit  
Keep your eyes wide cause the style gets darker  
I make papers and see more new cars than Bob barker  
'Cause if the price ain't right then it's time to take flight  
Let the piece go twice to make sure you see the light  
Plus I'm dreaded not by the locks but by the cops  
And flocks of females that only think with their croth  
Unlimitted smoke  
The bonified cut throat Columbian neck tie  
Now don't you look fly  
I'll leave you there to be discovered by your mother  
Or maybe your brother or your boty boy lover  
No matter your backround Xzibit never backs down  
Be prepared for static and semi automatics in your grill  
  
[Chorus]: (2x)  
Eyes may shine, Teeth may grit  
And all of that shit  
And you still won't step  
So what's next?  
All of a sudden you ain't sayin nothin  
[You Better off buckin yourself]  
[You need to stop frontin]  
  
Everything that come around go 3.6.0.  
Longtitude and latitude  
It's alll in the attitude  
I'm in the mood to put a twist on things  
Xzibit here to rock the planet 'till the fat bitch sings  
The shit is closer than you think  
Don't blink it might be over in a matter of seconds  
I'd like to say this off the record  
But it's not  
So I testify to the fact  
Chronic mixed with the Yak make a hellified contact  
It makes it real easy to trip  
Unload the whole clip on your block then split!  
ain't no answers to the test you taken  
Never move fakin'  
Can't be shaken'  
From my solid foundation like this  
  
[Chorus]: (2x)  
Eyes may shine, Teeth may grit  
And all of that shit  
And you still won't step  
So what's next?  
All of a sudden you ain't sayin nothin

A full clip to make this bullshit stop  
I'm in the struggle to bring the underground to the top  
Head lock, Las Angeles, home of the scandalous  
And beautiful bitches, smell the aroma  
Nothin but doja, the Likwit soldier  
Quick to fold you in half, sit back and laugh at you  
Xzibit standing firm ground like a stone statue  
You ever have a .45 slug blown at you?  
We unstoppable, so everything is possible  
  
[Chorus]  
Xzibit maintain focus till the casket drop  
That's (focus) the only to survive and stay on top  
Fast 5 days straight to meditate, build hunger  
And focus(focus) on the days and times that approach us  
And focus(focus) on the days and times that approach us  
  
Be on the lookout  
Cause this year some niggas gettin' took out  
Takin' off of the scene  
Man versus machine  
I live between a rock and a hard place  
About face stand straight  
This is General X  
Dedicated to the critics that hope and pray  
That some day I'll go soft  
And try to swing with a gimmick and fall off  
Runnin' with dogs you can't call off  
Isolate to eliminate  
That's the mind state  
Never violate  
I make your whole chest dialate  
Defeat my appetite to annhilate  
I carry the weight from state to state  
Spread the product  
Tired of friends and relatives gettin' shot up  
It's time for some action like Redman' and be -Real  
Cause I can be a dead man if I stand still  
Too close for comfort, I'm under the gun  
Like a felon going back  
I'm ready to crack  
Making niggas role the credits and fade to black  
Fade to black fade to black fade to black  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yeah, everyday of my life  
Got clear thinking, and everything stay tight  
Drop bomb shit  
Only bomb shit  
Here come Xzibit to break it down like this  
  
[Chorus]

"
"When I look you in your eyes I can see my own  
Straight love manifested in flesh and bone  
You's a breath of fresh air in this world of shit  
You was born to be a soldier don't ever forget  
Hit back when hit  
Use force that's effective  
All these bitches and women  
Son, please be selective  
This is California can't stick your dick in everything  
We will survive necessarily by any means  
Let no man ever hold you down or suppress you  
It's the 90's the police just arrest you,  
disrespect you on occasion take life  
By the time you come of age they'll probably blast on sight  
It's a shame they protect them but try to serve us  
When your neck is on the line stand ground then bust  
In God we trust but just in case keep it loaded and locked  
Ready to rock  
Then shake the spot  
The Foundation  
  
You came from a long line of killers and drug dealers  
Who forever smoke bud  
So it's probably in your blood  
Realize you can only run the streets so long  
Then the streets run you into the ground then gone  
It's kinda ruff trying to teach you what's right from wrong  
Same shit different day  
It's the same ol' song  
If the time ever comes that I meet my match  
Take control of my assets  
Fuck startin' from scratch  
Take care of your mother  
Keep yourself on track  
Just cause niggas get behind you don't mean they got your back  
Beware of the serpent  
Cause there's a time in life the mothafucker will strike  
And try to make you loose sight  
Don't be a fake mothafucker tryin' to keep shit real  
Fill cassettes with idle threats with no guts to kill  
Son if you ever pull heat  
Then use it  
If you got a chance to walk away  
Then do it  
Total domination takes full concentration in all situations  
A solid foundation  
  
You are the foundation  
Beginning of a new generation  
I remember hospital hallway pacin'  
I was anxious as fuck to see your face shine  
Only to find that yours looked like mine  
So it's like I'm livin' twice at the exact same time  
In this life you can't press stop  
Then press rewind  
Gotta live to the fullest never follow behind no man  
Have your own plan, expand your mind  
Ain't no paper thin game to raise wannabe thugs  
This is nothing but love  
Via satellite Mug gs  
Take heed when it's your turn to bring new life  
Make sure it's the woman you gonna make your wife  
Be prepared for the worst  
But expect the best  
No matter where life takes you  
Come home to the West  
Survival takes more than just gats and guns  
That's words to live by  
From a father to a son

"This cannot continue  
We must go our separate ways  
Without you, I can do better  
But first these words I have to say  
It's not that I don't hear you  
When you scream and curse my name  
It's just that I don't feel you  
Nigga, you invade my space  
Yeah, blacked out, tatted up, let's go, saddle up  
I'm alge-ballin', dumb niggaz can't add it up  
Cock back, back 'em up, fuck what you throwin' up  
All these rappers comin' out, ain't nobody showin' up  
Man, where your talent at? Show me where your balance at  
You the king of the streets? Well, I ain't heard none of that  
Just like the South say, watch what your mouth say  
Frank Sinatra hustle, Rat Pack, 'Did it My Way'  
I know we don't see eye to eye, you ain't never lied  
We should part ways 'fore somebody catch a homicide  
Recognize, lost a lotta love when my momma died  
Did a gang of shit, I'm surprised that I'm still alive  
Fishburn's yellin' wake up, open up my eyes  
Don't believe them lies from them guys that you idolize  
Ridicule, try to downplay, try to minimize  
And criticize when you on your grind, so I realized  
This cannot continue  
We must go our separate ways  
Without you, I'll do better  
But first these words I have to say  
It's not that I don't hear you  
When you scream and curse my name  
It's just that I don't feel you  
Nigga, you invade my space  
Go ahead, spit it out, that's right, get it out  
So I can respond, nigga, fuck what you talk about  
Drop like a guillotine, money over everythin'  
Seems to be the theme in the land of the Philistine  
Mentally you still shackled up on some lame shit  
Side by side on the bottom of a slave ship  
Came a long way from the place that I started from  
Ever seen a man's last breath beaten out of him?  
Hate manifest from the inside out  
The shit starts in your heart, then spill out your mouth  
I'm the odd man out, watch it all pan out  
I see you tryin' to stand up but you don't stand out  
Now that I found that my path is original  
Prepared, never scared, had to peak at my pinnacle  
I'm not like you, but you think we identical  
It's pitiful, you can never bang with the criminal  
This cannot continue  
We must go our separate ways  
Without you, I'll do better  
But first these words I have to say  
It's not that I don't hear you  
When you scream and curse my name  
It's just that I don't feel you  
Nigga, you invade my space  
Three wheels, lock it up, ammo, stock it up  
It's not for niggaz 'cause George Bush comin' after us  
That's why it's time to roll, get where I gotta go  
All my people fightin' for they soul, you are not alone  
Never waste my pearls on the swine and the ignorant  
Forever on my grind, you despise and belittle it  
Here's a little tidbit, X rock that real shit  
Dump like a L.A.P.D. cop, overkill shit  
Hooked on a brand new high called monopolize  
Put you on track where you just, you was out of line  
And I ain't got the time to fuck around with the dumb shit  
You know that young shit, the 'Hey nigga, where you from?' shit  
Even though the pistol in my hand, I'm a businessman  
People grow apart, don't expect you to understand  
Let's part ways and then pray for better days  
I realize somebody 'bout to die, so I came to say  
This cannot continue  
We must go our separate ways  
Without you, I'll do better  
But first these words I have to say  
It's not that I don't hear you  
When you scream and curse my name  
It's just that I don't feel you  
Nigga, you invade my space  
Yeah, knowhatI'msayin'?

Yeah, stop askin' where the fuck I'm at, yeah

What's my anti-drug? drugs!  
Anti-drugs is when I can't get none, for fun  
I drop flows, punk the punk rappers  
Load clips for nines and clap with gun clappers  
Listen, too many motherfucking cooks in ya kitchen  
Missin' the most important part of life 'cause you bitchin'  
Bitchin' so much you should tuck ya nuts  
And dick between ya thighs and color your eyes  
And wax your legs and buy some bras and thongs  
And go crazy in the nightclub for sisqo's songs  
You a hook motherfucker with the jordache look  
Bring lead with ya heat so the beef can cook

Watched fiends suck crack through car antennas  
Now that we winning motherfuckers aim to get us  
The game is vicious constant hostile conditions  
For the times I dropped jewels and nobody would listen (nope)  
A new position, got a couple of pots to piss in  
Got the aim of oswald nigga I ain't missin'  
If everybody eating' who the fuck gone clean the kitchen  
I got vision, and a real deep suspicion  
About a lot of rappers reps and they street conditions  
Everybody got bricks of yay, claim they do crimes that pay  
And tell you that it paved the way (bullshit!)  
Well only a few niggaz really came up this way  
With gunplay day-to-day quick to blow you away  
Trying to sound like snoop, trying to ball like dre  
I just think you mutherfuckers ain't got shit to say

"1996, the Disfunctional member of the Alkohaliks family  
It's XZIBIT, Bring it live, one time, like this  
  
Sometimes I wonder if it's all worth my while  
Xzibit stay versitile  
With Million Dollar lifestyle  
And I can feel it as a child growin' up  
  
The niggaz that were real and the niggaz that were scared as fuck  
That's why Xzibit only roll with a chosen few  
You ain't really real, I can tell when I look at you  
So ease off the trigga talk, you ain't killin shit  
  
It's not affecting me or the niggaz that I'm chillin with  
I don't believe the hype or buy a Woof ticket  
Nigga you make a gang of noise and never seem like a cricket  
I guess that's why we never kick it  
  
A lot of niggaz are soft and get tossed tryin to fuck with the liquid  
How many niggaz do you know like this?  
Also claimin that they're riding but they really turn bitch  
It don't make sense  
  
Either you're a soldier from the start  
Or an actor with a record deal tryin to play the part  
Like dat  
  
[Chorus]  
It's a shame  
Niggaz in the rap game  
Only for the money and the fame  
EXTRA LARGE  
It's a shame  
Niggaz in the rap game  
Only for the money and the fame  
Paparazzi  
  
I don't need no lights no cameras  
Just action god dammit  
Never no superstar  
I'm more like a planet  
  
So my composure is kept while others start to sweat  
A merchant from the fog with my fucked up dialogue  
Try to live high on the hog leaves you bankrupt  
And niggaz you spent it on, would not give a fuck  
  
Now that's deep, how deep, It's deeper than Atlantis  
Home of the scandalous  
Big Bad Los Angeles  
Dangerous, Vandelous  
  
Yo, not to be trusted  
So how the fuck is you hard  
Not being scared by the boulevard  
I'm pulling that card and sayin Gin muthafuckar  
  
Flowin like liquid, soak it in muthafuckar  
I'm breakin it down, my sounds, so crowds are like deaf  
From the West  
Puttin whole counties to the test  
  
It's all in perspective  
Breaker one-nine copy  
This is for the niggaz gettin caught up in the Paparazzi  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Niggaz smoke stress and cross dress  
But I just play the back  
Others going through schemes and pipe dreams  
For a contract  
  
Real tightly rolled, fuck 'em all how I feel  
I made a cool half mil  
Before I had a record deal  
There for you look and stare like it's magic  
  
Too much of anything can make you an addict  
When devils be startin static, forgot the automatic  
I set it off straight, I spread hate, then I vacate, but wait  
Who dare to cross this path  
  
Yo, I do ya like math  
Cut with glass, make a blood bath  
So on behalf of all niggaz I get drunk with  
Smoke a lot of blunts with  
  
I dispose of your punk shit  
Keep it all in perspective  
Carbon Copies gettin caught up in the Paparazzi

There's enough to go around and they don't mind sharin'  
Get between your thighs, make ya exercise  
You ain't gotta waste no time with no 'fuck me' eyes  
I'm like all day long up in ya  
Take a break, make a drink, roll the 'wood, let the games continue  
Uh, (you make me so hot) - you better than the rest of them bitches  
I'll bang your back out in every position  
I never listen to the shit niggaz say  
How you're easy to spread, like to pop pills and fuck all day  
But baby that's alright with me  
If you thinkin' long-term, bitch that's what it ain't gon' be

Now riddle me this...  
Whenever I hit her hard in the middle she piss  
Do I take that as normal and watch her play with her tits?  
I'm confused, I feel so used - and I got the dick  
Now what am I doin' here?  
She tell me she wants to keep the condom as a souvenir  
And that's kinda weird to me  
I guess this ol' fuck session ain't what it appear to be  
Because the concierge has just brought the bill to me  
I go 200 miles per hour on a street bike  
And 9-0 beats per minute on a sweet mic  
Whenever I get with bitches I lose a little somethin'  
Sperm by the zones, we keep it hot and goin'  
Xzibit we got it flowin', don't even approach us, you only get roaches  
How you gon' smoke with us nigga when you can't even focus  
Cause we don't break bread with bitches, we take head from bitches  
Cause niggaz be gettin' dead from bitches for bein'

In the club drinkin' with all my homies  
And ain't no worries tonight 'cause we poppin' off  
Don't bite me, but if you wanna fight me

The nigga that's been down  
with the set since birth  
Whatever it was worth  
I checked in on the norm  
Since a juvenile callin'  
Shots in the dorm  
Moms said you better get right  
Or shake the spot  
I chose to break and be a rollin' stone  
Like pop  
Stashin' the rocks by the gats  
With the Gs  
So I can talk crazy when the narks yell freeze!  
I don't fight the feelin'  
Gotta hustle with a passion  
Comin' cross state to put you down  
With some action  
In actuallity I keeps it real in the streets  
Remininsin' younger days  
Over gangsa ass beats  
And I,  
Hit the weed  
Til myeye balls bleed  
While my life is corrupted  
By lust and greed  
Serve you anything from cocaine  
Up to speed  
I came with the drank  
So here's five on the weed  
  
Xzibit:  
See kids don't belong  
Up in grown folks business  
The Likwit niggas rollin' through with a thickness  
Sickness bear witness  
Like tequlla without a chaser

Niggas guaranteed to drown  
Legendary sound  
From the west coast underground  
The mighty King Tee  
And Mr. X to the Z, see  
Never underestimate the power  
Of the X man  
Dismantle your plans  
Or just catch you with a back hand

With the know how  
Cool in a gang  
And ain't about to change  
My lifestyle  
Catchin' bodies in this uphill battle  
But Xzibit unravel  
Have smoke will travel  
I bust Teflon rhymes  
Into the crowd, bitch

You need to pump your brakes to avoid the collision  
Xzibit still winnin'  
Unanimous decisions  
  
King Tee:  
It's going down  
Once again everybody lay down  
Run your money and the jewels  
To the front without a sound  
The infamous supreme King Tee  
Glad to meet ya  
Derranged in the mothafuckin' brain  
Through ya speaka and hey  
I walk around the hood lookin' looped  
Strapped like a mothafuckin'  
Desert strom troop  
Niggas be like ""King Tila  
How you get that Benz?""  
By sending birds to Oklahoma City  
To my friends  
I slang my gangsta funk  
Through the night  
Sometimes I fight

Compton is where I dwell  
It's like hell  
Slangin' the shit that got the smokers  
In a spell  
And all my homies live lives  
Like crooks  
Rich and infamous  
Hoes want to look but get shook  
Cause we don't trust you hoes  
You'll have a nigga fucked up  
With a bullet through his clothes

Negativity positively how we live

Ladies and gentlemen  
Undivided attention

Most dangerous things next to grizzles  
Unsolved mysteries  
Xzibit hit you penetentary style  
Quick sharp and straight to the neck  
I'm heavy on your chest  
I'm all up in your life

The coast that resides to your left

"[Chorus - Xzibit]  
I'm the police, I'm the police  
I'm the police, I'm the police  
[Verse 1 - Xzibit]  
I love my fucking rob, and I don't want to stop  
Ever since I was a child, I wanted to be a cop  
You know protect and serve, a couple traffic stops  
I make a bust, and take something out the top  
A thin blue line, we run these streets  
You bang on them, but never bang on me  
I cell search, stepping on pillows and sheets  
I'm the police, treat a nigga just like fresh meat  
I got a short wick, on some New York shit  
Take you to the precinct and fuck you with a broomstick  
I patrol your hood, put you on my hood  
Leave you in the wrong hood, got it understood  
PC 647b, that's a prostitute, plus she kind of cute  
She don't want to jail, well bitch I'll tell you what  
Get on your muthafuckin' knees, suck my partner up  
[Chorus]  
I'm the police, I'm the police  
I'm the police, I'm the police  
[Verse 2 - Xzibit]  
You know a couple of muthafuckas was giving us grief  
Pulled a couple strings, dodge the media beef  
Ever since them niggaz in black said ""Fuck the police""  
I been grinding on the back of my teeth, loading my piece  
Waiting for some, get back like it or not  
We investigated the shots, that killed Biggie and Pac  
Ever wonder why nobody ever figured it out  
Cause we the ones that got to figure it out  
I shout freeze at the top of my lungs  
I'm the cream of the crop  
You don't stop you get popped by my warning shots  
And if you try to come back, with a civil suit  
I sit back and watch my system take a shit on you  
[Bridge]  
Order in the court, Order in the court  
That muthafucka shot me, case dismissed  
Ha Ha Ha Ha, police  
I'm the police  
[Verse 3 - Xzibit]  
You see this fuckin' badge, you see these fuckin' lights  
I'm in your neighborhood rolling on you every night  
You faggots run and duck, look at you scared as fuck  
You see me coming in your mirror niggaz straighten up  
Turn that hat around, I'm here to take you down  
Hey partner look at these weapons and this coke I found  
I'm going to let it slide, show you who you can trust  
And if you want to keep selling, nigga you sell for us  
Make you a 1030, I'll get you hands dirty  
Murder for hire, professional liar  
I plan to make police chief and then retire  
I remember when you set your own hood on fire  
I reinforce the freeways, to bring the tanks  
So the next time y'all trip, fuck bloods and crips  
Cause we the biggest gang in L.A.  
Ramp Part, fuck with us, get blown away

"Yeah, today the big day  
(Xzibit)  
Been here four years, eleven months and twenty-nine hot ones  
One more day and I'm a free man walkin  
Leavin from behind these gates, I paid my debt to the state  
And ever since they took the weights  
Wasn't much for a nigga to do but start thinkin  
Wishin I was back home drinkin every weekend  
Remember like it's yesterday, eight-teen and ?  
I can't remember the letters I just wrote a lot of them  
Goin for a ride that I cannot stop  
Set up shop in Cochran, connect the dots  
And for those that don't know, that's the Pen-East to Fresno  
Northeast to Baskersfield, fuck ""Let's Make a Deal""  
Livin around niggaz who kill, right along with the niggaz who will  
At the drop of a hat, sharpen up anything hard to stab you with that  
Niggaz givin up the manhood they can't get back  
It's a sick university, murder the cirriculum  
Concrete campuses, I miss Los Angeles  
More than that I'm missin my kids  
Missin my turf, missin my bitch, what could be worse?  
Shouldn't have asked that, called the bitch collect (It's Xzibit)  
Some nigga picked up, wanted to break her neck  
When kites slide up under your door, you slide them back  
Cause when you pick em up and read em that's where you're at  
And if you ain't rollin with that then watch your back  
Level four right away, gettin hit the same day  
Playin the price for the games you play  
Never realize how precious time is til you give it away  
Can't remember what a t-bone taste like  
I stayed awake nights listening to the sounds of prison life  
Motherfuckers cryin, shanks gettin sharpened  
Tacs gettin taced up, plottin and talkin  
Sellin everything from weed to blow  
When it's time for you to go you're the last to know  
niggaz holdin weight, essays got the power  
Locked down, one shower every seventy-two hours  
? tuna, trigger happy sharpshooters  
Waitin for the jump off, can't wait to thump off  
Had to smash a nigga readin my shit  
Tryin to intercept my outside and write my bitch  
I seen niggaz sleep for weeks, get too weak  
And then physically and mentally cannot compete  
Find new shit to master, make the time move faster  
Home sweet home, shipped off to Land Caster  
Kept a low pro, close to home and I'm trippin  
Time to catch up with all the shit that I been missin  
Everybody runnin they mouth, pussy to count  
Cause bitches in Cali love niggaz that's freshed out  
But some of these niggaz on swipe  
Gettin out with the virus caught from the nigga he liked  
Fuck that, when I touch back I got plans  
If I can't rock the powder, rock the fans  
Give my naked pictures away, shake some hands  
Hope I never seen none of you motherfuckers again  
On all times take the long walk to the front gate  
Dress out expandin shit, today my release date

[X] Yeah, what's up nigga  
[G] Hey get in the car, my nigga, sup X?  
Here goes ya motherfuckin chain nigga  
Lucky I didn't pawn that motherfucker  
[X] Ha, yeah right  
Check it out dog, everybody know that you just got out  
That shit was all on the radio  
But dig it I got two strippin bitches  
just flew in from motherfuckin Las Vegas  
ready to get down and dirty, I got a pound of weed, got on the Hennessy  
Everybody at the club waitin, what you want to do?

Hey 'cause, this nigga talkin' all this shit right?  
Boom, the homie came up and was like  
""Nigga say that shit in my motherfuckin' face""  
Popped him dead in his motherfuckin' mouth nigga  
Niggaz be talkin' all this shit  
The only thing I wanna know is, look

See when the drama pop off, then pardon me, it ain't my fault  
My back was up against the wall, thanks to y'all

You need to say it to my face if you got somethin' to say bout me  
Cause that's the way it's supposed to be, but you ain't no G

Sometime men got some more than women  
You do too good in Cali the prey start to turn to venom  
You can't walk in these shoes nigga, you can't fit 'em  
I'm bout five seconds away from the ""let's go get him""  
So nigga (say it to my face) if you're feelin' like King Kong  
Mysery love company, I guess I'm a leave y'all  
Until that day, you wanna tuck them nuts  
And try to hit my switches and get your frame fucked up  
You gotta (say it to my face), I'm right here with a 12-gauge  
You talkin' to a man that plan on dyin' of old age  
Until that day, I crush everything in my way  
And give a fuck about what y'all say  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Too much of anything makes you a addict  
Wantin' contact with another man makes you a faggot  
Patience is virtue, don't make me hurt you  
I came full circle, about-face reversal  
Salute the general, make yourself presentable  
Analytical, every move made political  
(Say it to my face) and wake up in a hospital  
Huh, gutter never takin' me under  
Fuckin' nerve of you motherfuckers  
Thinkin' I was slippin', I was servin' you motherfuckers  
X went off the deep end, I'm determined you motherfuckers  
So watch how you speakin'  
Cause I'm listenin' closely for any pussy approachin' me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Nigga, you better come with the Taliban  
Never been a slave or afraid of another man  
X move like the brutal force of an avalanche  
It ain't my fault you smoked off your chance  
See motherfuckers envy what they cannot be  
Mr. X to the Z, H.N.I.C.  
Shh, half assed niggaz gon' shit on me  
If they sentence me to five I'll be out in three  
You'll be deep in the dirt for the bugs to eat  
Tucked in for eternity, time to sleep  
Til' that day, I'll crush everything in my way  
And give a fuck about what y'all say  
  
See when the drama pop off, then pardon me, it ain't my fault

"I had the right to sublurr, because they ache one stick  
I saw five to six million but, yo, that ain't really shit  
It was supposed to be different, we were supposed to write out  
But tumach shot his girl, then shot himself in the mouth  
Then the steady game form very soon fell apart  
Because when you just doing all, the loyalty in your heart  
Slight catch a long hymn on all these niggas  
Forgetting where they're coming from  
And they're slowing down, wait a minute, what we're running from?  
This what we're supposed to do, here's where we're supposed to be  
I hated MTV for trying to play me like a mockery  
But that don't bother me, I just fulfill my fucking contract  
Small price to pay just to take a piece of my back  
My back, backfire, assassination of my character  
Just demassing me in the America  
My younger sister, Erika, just adopted a child  
My older brother served fifteen, he made it out  
Even though my father loved me, I ain't seen him for a while  
Had to fight my baby, bitch, give me my nigga now  
Cause I'm running out of time and I need him to understand  
The way a superior man had build a brand  
Niggas talk about my taxes, had to pay, I consemn  
I'm surviving cause the lines ass crooked in the hand  
  
Heartbreak, disappointment, my mother died when I was nine  
I just wanted to join her  
Now I miss to join her, get to California  
I got something for you to do, it was like I was annoying  
Resurrected, found my purpose, I remember being dragged  
Being nervous when I would kick my verses  
I was virtually worthless, my whole life was a circus  
I was sleeping with serpents and I thought it is worth it  
Got a call from Paul, told me shit isn't working  
Exchange words, told me tell me that shit in person  
He probably told him, and by the way did he said it  
On a prolijetic twisted made about him  
I see Slim and he said he didn't recognize me  
Was it that or did he let another man to find me?  
I don't know, but now I gotta get this all behind me  
Follow my calling when I used to follow niggas blindly  
  
I wish I had a better relationship with my uncles  
Blood relatives I could turn to when I'm feeling trouble  
And talk about my struggles  
My uncle John Nail, he only put me on the phone  
With different females  
And this is such a such, nephew, tell me, what's up?  
Ain't even ask about your man in Cali, growing up  
Fuck, I drink it all and I smash the bottle  
Self medicated numb, but I'm a feel it tomorrow  
It feel like pain and sorrow was like a second skin  
But now that pain was gone I got my second win  
Only the strong live long, you better settle in  
I'm fighting for ever, I will never let the devil win  
1983, that's when my journey begins  
I searched every word for stritting, only find it within  
This for me and my kid, still trying to live  
Living life to the fullest 'till I see you again

How does WHAT feel? Not havin to scrape for a meal?  
Not bein locked down to a fucked up deal?

Made a whole album, spent HALF what you spent  
then sent the rest to my people to invest wit it

Huh, Xzibit turn your vital signs to a straight line  
Never seen a dog bite and bark at the same time

His mother and father just had a new born baby  
Now his father was an Imam who carried the weight  
And built his family on 5 pillars of faith  
Never trippin off Western ways, it meant nada  
Pilgramige to Mecca to circle around Kabba  
300 miles away, British troops hit Basra  
His cousin waged jihad and died with honor  
He heard about the buildings on 9-11  
And a man named Bush on a search for weapons  
Now here come the U.S., to crush Saddam  
Wit 88 thousand tons of missile and bombs  
But his family's too broke to move or find shelter  
If they all had to die, they would die together and that's cold... damn

"Yeah so it all comes down to this (what?)  
Specialist with a hit list  
Right fist bomb type M.G.M. fight night type (ding ding)  
So when I hits in the stage we can Face Off

Bring heat in ridiculous ways never compromise  
Look into my eyes tell me what you see (what?)  
Victory ecstasy maybe Hennessy  
Energy wasted, enemies gettin' laced with  
That point blank to the face shit  
Who you think this is  
Young black bust a nigga ass strictly business man  
Self disciple Heineken let the record spin  
Paparazzi all over again, times ten  
Like thee original sin  
I'm tryin' to fuck it up for everybody  
The hot ? get collect calls from John Gotti  
I kick back like karate  
Butter soft burn off and solid black Mazaratti like  
  
Get caught up in the game (it gets deeper then that)  
No gain with no pain (it gets deeper then that)  
Dyin' in the fast lane (way deeper then that)  
To the place where the motherfuckin' problem is at  
  
Long hair ganja smoke but don't be mistaken  
I ain't Jamacian  
Find another chick to jerk  
A world of hurt 9 to 5 puttin' in work  
Never rest put to the test get put to the death  
Never the less only greater than  
Trust no man  
Soon to have the whole wide world inside of my hand  
So I suggest you act right my insight like sunlight  
Burn your cornea  
Big bad California  
To the Waldord Historia (c'mon)  
N.Y.C. competition wish to some day roll like me  
But all I see is capital H-E-A-T  
I'm makin' motherfuckers Run like DMC (run)  
The Likwit MC is here to blaze a nigga like a fat one  
Non radio bangin' shit goin' platinum  
And keep slappin' 'em with a Colt 45

Get caught up in the game (it gets deeper then that)  
No gain with no pain (it gets deeper then that)

Suck it easy Movin' On Up like George and Weezy  
You can't stop it love it or leave it alone  
Xzibit writtin' more pages then the state penetentary  
Full of well known villians that want to come home  
Never relax ain't no tellin' lay it on wax  
Make it bang let Stever sell 'em and dip 'em in chrome  
My nigga Bud'da chip off beats like cellular phones  
Heir to the thrown  
Xzibit bring the lead to your dome  
Like a 3rd world rebellion squad on your boulevard  
Protect they spots with heat  
They kids ggotta eat to make it big in Cali it depends on who you meet  
And who you sleep with  
Might find yourself in deep shit  
So hit me with your best shot  
I'm lookin' forward to it  
You shouldn't repeat it if you ain't really goin' through it  
How dare you try to check the fluid

"Witness the downfall of men  
I wanna kill you for your land, I don't mean to kill the reactor  
Linking in Japan, I am here, got the gangsta for all your chain chains  
March to the heart beat of the city  
You only hear the drums when they audace and they see me  
You know what time it is? Flavor with a thousand checks  
It's like the ice ring surrounds my neck  
I never worry about the referee, the gate keepers keep him locked for me  
Push all to shallow, forever  
Always will be underground X to the motherfucker Z  
Fold it all for the money, can't team, where my gangstars at?  
Hit the park, build at the car scene, blowing red everywhere  
Look how strong we are  
So there will be no war or shots  
I'm about to give my city boiling hot and make 'em pray for real  
And make 'em say my name, lit up more smoke than a power water drill  
Concentration, determination  
The very thin line between paradise and incarceration

Gangsters, gangsters  
Gangsters, stand up and rap what you're claiming  
Police roll around, shake us down, always playing and I  
Gangsters, gangsters  
Streets made me into this man, gotta represent who I am  
  
They say right before you day you get the irry feeling of peace  
Then walk into the light  
My soul want me take it without a fight  
She says she wanna spend the whole life  
But she only got me here for one night  
Said it's time, better get it in. Call your best friend  
I'm a call you wonder-twins  
Stop and go like red light traffic, innovation made it another classic  
We made it happen  
And big hip hop want us gut cut  
Niggas dare too much than offense popped up  
Another game fucked up, because the lanes clocked up  
But the content sucks  
I wanna fill up some big red trucks, tour then through  
The whole world, motherfuckers lining up  
'Cause these tickets won't move like crap  
You're tying west coast around my back  
And y'all niggas saying fuck it with that  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Can't even rely on your own eyes, everything fake now  
Toast to the bad guys  
That will leave a whole class swimming with the fishes  
Part machine, part skill, part intuition  
I cooked my first album in my father's kitchen  
He told me how to make a living, twenty grand and half a chicken  
Now I'm shitting on myself and still I let him know  
That if he turn me in a turn around, it kill us both  
This is a cold world, but I'm a polar bear  
Destroy the earth like a silver flare, best beware of us  
In God we trust, but everybody else gotta pay cash up front  
Caught there, they try to tear me down  
I'm on a level now, I speak like I mean it, the focus study my literature  
Clean house, taking out the trash. I'm in the fly zone  
Where you past, gangsta?

Don't make my desert eagle barrel touch the back of your throat  
Always approach niggaz that's known for killin your folks  
Be surprised who could turn around and bust on y'all  
Catch your mother or your sister comin out of the mall

No retaliation you basically runnin with fags  
In these streets, you only good as your last transaction  
Funny style, and these niggaz ain't laughin

Pull a pistol from my waist, nigga reach for space  
Smack the taste out of your mouth if you talk shit

"[Chorus]  
I'm sorry I met you  
I'm sorry I hurt you  
I'm sorry I killed you  
I'm sorry I murked you  
Because I'm all alone now nobody is with me  
Nobody to threaten that they about come get me  
I wish I could go back to where we began  
I wish you was alive so I could kill you again  
I wish we had more paths to cross  
Nobody even cares if they survive my loss  
My killer's remorse  
  
For me we are the same should be laughed at  
Could be the very fame shit to get your bitch ass clacked  
You fell slick next now drowning in your own pool out back  
I kick the cats and dog tube the shit I don't count that  
You're my angel of death I strangle till there's no breath  
I kill the kill kill till there ain't nobody left  
My conscience don't inhibit me I kill deliberately  
Just wanna be like God, cause God kills indiscriminately  
I'm so christian I'm so muslim  
Super size on your mom trigger get push up  
I'm parallel to hell I'm ready so Satan what's cooking  
And rappers running their mouth they don't know how close their bitch ass is
coked  
To get turned in ghosts nigga I will kill you  
Don't get it cross memories fade just as blood washes off  
I said memories fade just as blood washes off  
Hope to see you soon  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I feel so guilty my hands are filthy  
From decorating your face all over the building  
I'm staying sincere if I ain't making it clear  
I'm writing on the wall with the blood man I wished you were here  
But you moved on at your funeral I beat you with slam  
I hugged your mom tell your sister and her kids to be clam  
I will tell 'em you gone you just sleep in a dream and all c'est la vie  
We smoked you like the weed in the bong  
  
Have you ever seen the bloodstain  
And know that person has returned from every once came  
Regret is such an ugly thing only if you let it fuck with your brain  
But it ain't gonna change a fucking thing  
What's done is done chop that shit up to the game  
You're still dead when I'm still alive  
And I never got the chance to utilize my best alibi  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Started the bullshit escalated to violence  
In result of the violence infinite permanent silence  
Now I feel empty not even existing  
My worst enemy is no longer against me  
I remember the hatred and how it consumed me  
And you felt the same thing but never could move me  
A shot to the face is nothing like in the movies  
The back of your brain is out the body keeps moving  
So I should rejoice now because you are past tense  
The last of my enemies the last of you bastards  
The dirt on your casket  
I'm so alone now you were the reason to carry my danger my chrome out  
And I just sold out and wait for the contact  
And life for the combat and now we be on that  
And I'd take it all back if I knew what I knew now  
What's a shooter without somebody to shoot down

When vocal chords spit cold shit they never thaw out  
Industry tried to pigeonhole, I had to crawl out  
Hear my name bein called out, nuclear fallout  
Full body armor with bangers, we goin all out  
Garbage bags in trunk of the car, it won't stall out  
Hit you where you stay, hogtied, you gettin hauled out  
Crush the whole car, it's well planned and thought out  
Try to attain fame from beef, you went the wrong route  
Scrape a 38 on your teeth, I knock 'em all out  
I know you ain't fuckin with me dawg (c'mon NOW)  
Underestimate, run up on, it's on now  
Have your niggaz plottin revenge and puttin songs out  
Demise by design, blueprints is drawn out  
Flood crack back in the hood, it's been a long drought  
Show you what this gangster killa Cali is all about  
  
[Chorus - repeat 2X]  
KLACK - for the niggaz that bang in the inner city and  
KLACK - for the enemies creepin to come and get me  
Be thankful, if you get away alive  
You wouldn't kill or won't let nothin die, so keep it movin

Don't make me spit predict your last action  
Last man standin (yeah) last man laughin (yeah)  
Assassin, crosshairs, smile for the birdie (CLICK!)  
Hit you long range, high powered, 30-30 shit  
If you never heard of a heavy assault rifle  
Hit targets a mile away from the top of the Eiffel (woo!)  
Knock the soul out of your body, stay plottin like Bin Laden  
to swoop down and crash your party  
All bark no bite (SHIIIT!) we don't bark nigga  
We bite to the white then shake 'til the afterlife  
Hard work and sacrifice, who's your daddy?  
Make you want to drop e'rything and move to Cali  
We classic, go 'head, speak my name  
And I'ma lay your ass down like the All Star game, c'mon  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[possibly Strong Arm - uncredited]  
Sawed-off shotgun, shoot through your shoulderblade  
Bitch-made niggaz get, hit with a hand grenade  
Blow up your Escalade, then I hit the road  
and I'm back in the hood lookin for somethin to smoke  
Everytime, I use the element of surprise  
With a gun that's big enough to make an elephant hide  
I elevate my rhythm by hustlin crack addicts  
Get locked but, when I'm released I'm back at it  
See, Mitch know the time, in front of me the birdie and  
Phil got the customers comin to get it early we  
came a long way from po-lice chasin us

Yeah klack for the strippers in clubs shakin they titties

My life is the movie so listen to the soundtrack  
This what its all about  
You better stall me out  
And feel the aim of the name you niggas callin out  
  
[Chorus]  
If you feelin how I'm feelin  
And you ready and willin  
to come to the table  
I put it together who doin it better  
Come bounce with me (Come on)  
You can smoke a whole ounce with me (Right on!)  
Take em out!  
If you movin how I'm movin  
And you chosen and proven  
So lose the illusion  
The top guns cue the confusion  
Come bounce with me (Come on!)  
You can smoke a whole ounce with me (Right on!)  
Take em out!  
  
I'm tired, I'm hungry  
You're lazy, disgusting  
You're lay around my house and ya never do nothing  
I seen it, believed it  
Planned it, conceived it  
Missed me with the bullshit bitch I don't need it  
I cheated, you cheated  
We cheated, so beat it  
Eat it like a dick bitch you too conceited  
I broke it, replaced it  
I slammed it, I chased it  
Hands in the air if ya love gettin wasted baby!  
You never seen us before  
You betta come and get it  
You with it I'm with it  
I'm busy baby you fuckin with it  
Is it your place or mind  
don't want to waste your time  
And you can get it how you want it it'll blow ya mind  
Its over time  
Takin pride in the bump and grind  
A hit from behind to leave you with a broken spine  
This what its all about  
You better stall me out  
Its just the game of the name you bitches callin out  
  
[Chorus]  
Pop it, drink it  
Float it, sink it  
Plan to stop me then you better rethink it  
Drive it, use it  
Pimp it, abuse it  
Shit motherfuckers do to hip-hop music  
I live it, I die it  
I'm laughin, I'm cryin  
Pop two of these bitch, lets start flying  
I hear it, I taste it  
I touched it, I faced it  
Breakin down the bullshit back to the basics  
I had to kick in the door  
that's how I had to get it  
I shitted with lyrics  
And getting better for fuckin credit  
Gettin gangsta with it  
The best that ever did it  
Hit it and quit it my nigga  
You shouldn't babysit it  
We need more emcees and less wannabes  
Three hundred and sixty degrees of reality  
that's what its all about  
Kill em and haul em out  
Now feel the aim of the name you haters callin out

"Yeah, check it out, they say behind every strong man  
Is an even stronger woman  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause she, was put here to defeat me  
Cause she, cuss me out, quick to leave me  
Cause she, not what I want, not what I want, not what I need  
Cause she, blow my phone up, to reach me  
Cause she, tried to lock, now she leaves me  
Cause she, not what I want, not what I want, not what I need  
  
Man, X aint' with that sucka shit  
I'm from a place, where they quick to say ""Fuck A Bitch""  
And gettin' grits, off of pussy, try ta get a hitch  
But I'm a bachelor, stackin' it, drinkin', need to quit  
Me and my clique, ride through cities like we own the shit  
You caught my eye, looking fly, body lookin' thick  
So who am I? I reply with my government, exchange the numbers  
Escapades for days, satisfying my hunger  
Don't trip, you from a long list, a long line  
Get in line, you so fucking fine, you spendin' time  
Introduce you as a friend of mine, never my woman  
I got twenty twenty cord vision, seein' you comin'  
Livin' my life, I don't need a wife  
But you persist, tryin' ta strengthen our relationship  
But I'm a dog, and a dog gotta run the streets  
Without a leash, this ain't workin' so I'm sayin' peace  
You ain't the one for me!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You found some way to hold on, through all the bullshit  
Never seen a woman so strong, I used to pull shit  
Now them days, long been gone, I gotta move in them streets  
Provide a place for all my peoples to eat  
I'm feelin' stuck, had to hustle up  
The ATF hit the house, had me shackled up  
You lost your mind, hate the time, I was in and out  
You never let a brother down, when you stressin' out  
You stressin' wanted me, to figure out a different route  
You could've left, but you a rider and stuck it out  
And it's a trip, because it's like you never missed a beat  
You waited anxiously, patiently, stayin' strong for me  
I sat aside, thinking back to the way I was  
The way I am, and how I gotta be a stronger man  
I understand that you love me and you want the best  
But if you want to take the good, you gotta take the rest  
I rock a vest, baby!  
  
Cause I, run these streets for my struggle  
Cause I, carry heat for my troubles  
Cause I, is that what you want, is that what you want, is that what you need?  
Cause I, want family so I'm buildin'  
Cause I, want futures for my children  
Cause I, is that what you want, is that what you want, is that what you need?  
  
And all this time it was you  
Baby forgive me for the pain, I was puttin' you through  
It's me and you against the world, so I'm keepin' it true  
I know I haven't been the best, the wrong things I pursue  
I used to think I was the MAN, wasn't havin' a clue  
I wasn't lookin' for no love, but I found it in you  
It's so true, behind every great man is a women  
Every time you call me, Baby Girl, I'm a come runnin'  
You got a soldier livin' right, girl you saved my life  
I sacrifice, anything to keep my family tight  
I seen the light, and when the world try to beat me down  
You always given me another reason, I can smile  
Cause you believed in me, when there was nothin' there to see  
My wife can be my better half, complete my family tree  
Ugh, nothin' can stop us now, Vera Wang gown  
Watchin' your father, walk his little lady down the isle  
Cause you the one for me!  
  
Cause she, was put here to complete me  
Cause she, wooze the earth, underneath me  
Cause she, got what I want, got what I want, got what I need  
Cause she, won't let go, she won't leave me  
Cause she, won't leave, what she don't need me  
Cause she, got what I want, got what I want, got what I need  
  
Dedicated to the real ones out there  
Ugh, yeah, this is for you

For right now here's a thousand, J, stay lo-key  
You say damn Xzibit, whyn't you pay a nigga a visit  
Time limits got me movin a million miles a minute  
Knee deep, gotta strike while the iron is hot  
Still gotta eat and keep the lights on when it's not  
Sleepin on cots, bullet wounds got you in knots  
I wish I was there to snatch you up instead of the cops  
Muthafuck it, do the time and get it out of the way  
You goin from convict to corporate nigga in one day (in one day)

So in essence it's obvious, I ain't never been this out before  
I'm spending 25-8 days, 366 times a year  
Up in the studio freakin and mixin rhymes in here  
Nothin but beer, bud smoke, Hen and Coke, women and sheer  
Callin playa niggas there  
Not the kinda place I really want to bring my son  
Get on lil' Dane, gon' in there and have you some fun  
Used to be that ??? be up there sewin ya clothes

And make my career take an incline  
I'm strict with knives, straight with razors  
Good with grenades and great with gauges  
Been around the world in a million stages  
Watch niggas bitch up and go through changes  
I had guns before thugs was in fashion  
I mashed out before niggas knew mashin'  
I knew terror before the plane started crashin'  
I got punch lines and niggas ain't laughin'

Got a flame thrower that'll burn big holes through your goose down

To bully any mothafucker wit problems and not get caught

For evidence of the weapon and the people involved  
Let one nigga' talk, everybody gettin' caught fa sho'

"I'm heavy hearted, heavy headed, misunderstand it  
Try the permanent repercussions, I empty the cannon  
I'm addicted to ganja, roll it up in a wood  
Drink a gallon of heaty, throw it up with the hood  
I'm a rhyme for my people, give my people a voice  
Never follow the leader, use the weapon of choice  
This is not an illusion, this is not a mirage  
Conversation with God, spilling my soul out  
I own assault weapons that fall down like Megatron  
The iron mob, try better bombs, I'm better alone  
So tag along like a dog with a bag of bones  
Smoke to the sack of gold, nigga on a grind  
Put my motherfucker records on  
So they can relate to the hate and the pain  
To the struggle and strain  
Never take it in vain, bring the one and the same  
Press and push your forehead at the back of your brain

I'm from the time where you couldn't pause comments  
Couldn't hide behind a computer

A barracuda for Buddha  
I maneuver to the manure, ignore the allure, the illusion  
My bad, sorry for all the confusion  
If you thought I was finished, if you thought I was done  
The saga continue, bring it back on the one  
I'm coming back with a gun, cause I saw that I know  
Meditated intentions, my shit ready to go  
Never taking a smoke, in my profession you need aggression  
A weapon, you can brand the shit to your own discretion  
And I hear, just a sandwich, nigga, what's your preference?  
I chose bad and now I'm headed in a right direction  
They're sick of the decisions, now my family is good  
Make you well understood, put you back where you should be

This go for all my people, people who see we're equal  
I feel they come, it is dark, I protect us from evil  
We misheard an illusion, car can make a confusion  
People constantly losing, we suffer everywhere  
Enough with all this swagger, party's a baggy bagger  
We hear a session is starting, let me show you what's heading at  
Money's so fucking tight, the root to all them fights  
She make you wanna not ever, not ever come home at night  
But she know that you go off with that stripping ho  
While your woman is wondering where does all your money go  
You try to make it rain, maybe lock you a chain  
Maybe inducing brain from bitches everywhere  
Pussy nigga, you lame, get on top of your game  
Feed your family, man, this is simple and plain  
Children retain, remember living upon the pain  
That's when they curse your name, they will see you do the same

My agenda is here, crystal perfectly clear  
Breathe apocalypse in, we have nothing to fear  
We have nothing to lose, pressure applying the rules  
Wasp on a motherfucker and knock him up out of his shoes  
That's what my coast love, good money, great drugs

Testimony testifier from the underground  
Order in the court, that's what you came to see  
The state of hip hop versus mister X to the Z  
  
I create in a dark, darkest place in my heart  
I finish off with your started terror, I tear you apart  
I am not for the cage, I'm the climb to the change  
Dread the eye and the needle, that means accurate aim  
That means I can arrange haters and hideous things  
I'm the sickness you feel, sickness from popping a vein  
Paranormal presence to people who can never explain  
Why deal with the devil when dealing with you is the same  
I got a proposition for all you bitches listening  
Get in position, let me nail it like a crucifixion  
Give you what you've been missing  
A man in my condition shouldn't be allowed around crowds without supervision

I've been tried and I'm true, reassemble my crew  
Carry on tradition, position I'm put here to do  
Make movements my elemental, I did make some improvements  
You can check my potential, tool to never pursue it  
If I listen to critics, there would be no Xzibit

And half-ass rappers that think they can get it  
We the Golden State, we keep the whole thing bouncing  
Why'all move units, we move mountains  
Why'all rap for bullshit, tryna be on T.V.  
We seen you, now we don't like Chandra Levy, I'ma  
  
[Chorus]

"
"Big bad insane Strong Arm Steady gang  
Way beyond the days of rockin' them stupid rapper chains  
Comin' through clear the lane, send a bullet through your brain  
Number one with a bullet, faster than the bullet train  
Pop it if you pull it mayne, hang with orangutans  
I live for my soldiers, ask them, they gon' say the same  
My gauge rings your bells like the Hunchback of Notre Dame  
Ain't even gotta say it, you motherfuckers know the name  
Legendary classic, niggaz be punk pussy and plastic  
Wastin' the time and the minds of the masses (yeah!)  
But look how strong we are, man I'm a motherfuckin' star  
Every week I cop a house and a car  
The mini-mansion off in Vegas with the vanquish  
That's where I mastermind my situations, determination and patience  
We don't speak the same language (no) I got a translator  
Spittin' twenty five times, see your bitch ass later, see'mon!  
  
[Chorus]  
That nigga X to the Z, that boy is somethin' to see, cause he a G  
I got the whole world waitin' on me!  
I'm about that grind so motherfucker don't waste my time  
I got the whole world waitin' on me!  
If you ready to ride, c'mon, get in my ride and let's slide  
I got the whole world waitin' on me!  
Yeah! I got the whole world waitin' on me!  
  
Niggaz screamin' they the shit but that shit ain't real  
I don't need to be the shit cause shit roll downhill  
I'm escalatin' aggressively, millions built up in equity  
Corporations invest in me, bangin' shit 'til the death of me (yeah!)  
Cooked coke recipe, money come back so thick  
My kid's kids couldn't spend this shit  
Get a grip, pop a clip, chop down that brick  
No amount of fame gon' change this gangsta spit  
Quick to roll out the backwood (yeah) smoke out your buildin'  
We soldiers devoted dressed down like civilians  
Niggaz wanna kill me because I make millions (that's weak!)  
That's weak like gangstas that hide behind children (hahaha, yeah!)  
Novocain the game, no shame  
No feelings, no names, no numbers, naw bitch  
You can't hang with us (no!)  
Ashes to ashes and you can't bust  
You so popcorn and fake industrious, yeah!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yeah, yeah, whattup Key?  
I'm liftin' plates you'll never find in the weight room  
So stay tuned my platoon finna touch down soon  
Cancun to St. Thomas, St. Thomas to the Bahamas  
Most niggaz ain't really honest so I'm watchin' my step  
I'm the hardest cold-hearted artist, the coast is clear  
Dubai, Australia to Africa, this is the year!  
Let the alcohol you sippin saturate in yo' system  
I be swimmin' through these women, man, fuck 'em and flip 'em  
I know you hopin' I would fall to the side, or go to Way Side  
It ain't a motherfucker alive to come and take mine (no!)  
Don't procrastinate, don't waste time  
Never faced time, Houdini with crime, traffic over state lines  
Military minded, stickin' to the base lines  
Intellectually brighter than California sunshine  
Yeah, I got my bars up, go pull my cars up (yeah)  
I love my struggle, never cover my scars up (c'mon)

New breed I'm the bad seed  
Smoke your weed til my mothafucking eyes

Come flip with a pimp, let me show ya how to nuke that swing like I was Nino  
Premro, Fat Boy, Eightball whatever y'all niggas wanna call me  
Call me for a hot sixteen I'ma shine in the booth like a brand new bling

Do my thang, spit some game you know how Gotti play it  
I'm like all these hoes gon' get it man  
One of these hoes gon' get it man  
From the 'Mound to the west to the north to the south

No fitted man just a head band, Polo shirt and some Birdmans  
Still thugged out and it ain't no secret  
I got my paper out the drug zones  
I got my paper out the gutter man  
Sellin' bud man with my brother man  
If you a North Memphis raised during my D Boy days  
You'd see why Gotti still love the game  
My wrist, my neck, my ear, my hand, my mouth look like a light show  
Yo bitch, my bitch, his bitch, her bitch just hit the flo' and get it low

This for all my street niggas and bitches

I'm ball all out with the biggest G's and spit and throw the sixteen  
When it come down to the south you know that I'm holdin' the key

If the trunk is popped it'll show in neon get it together  
Cause when I pull up at the valet man  
Eyes is wide and them jaws is droppin'  
Steppin' out the freshest clothes, brightest ice man the show is stoppin'  
People start oohin' me eyein' soon as they see us  
Women wanna be with us and fellas they wanna be us  
We the G's and don't try to fight it, got dro and we fixin' light it  
Laid back and that thang up on us we startin' to get excited

But in my palm I had that chromed out mac,

Flip a quarter bird to score a whole sack,  
Pull up in the club in a old school 'lac,

Want the money and the power, real niggas gon' stack,  
And ridin' fly, 25's on the back,  
Plushed out nigga keep a few stacks,

Disturbing peace inside my home  
Tryna tell my biz and shit so he can get inside the throne  
I guess the nigga like my song after I fucked a nigga's bitch  
I'm fucking niggaz all daily baby ain't gotta snitch  
Strong you'll never sell memoir salt don't kill a playa  
Once a hoe forever hoes always been a tattle tell  
Ever since the third grade still got the same waves  
Ridin' and kickin' shit with you  
And the hoe know every move I make  
This nigga must think I'm dumb  
Getting' the numbers out my phone  
All around hoe navi - gaty (navigator) lickin' out his tongue

Nigga I got hoes to give, hoe wit rides, and hoes wit cribs  
Synonyms and antonyms, negatives and positives

Mr. Tell It tell the truth, is you jealous or you jes?  
Overprotected don't fuck around and get no injection  
Not bout the bitch but bout the principle  
That you want to see me living life miserable  
They say bullets ain't got no name money ain't got no rules  
And a bitch gone do what she want to  
My street literature spit at her so quick and smooth  
She give a fuck about the hustling doubts that you went through  
So get yourself together dawg and tune in tonight  
She want to fuck with a thug Mr. Tell It you too nice  
All you want to do is lick her pussy and hit her bare  
She want to fuck with a nigga that don't really care  
Yo gotti hit the bitch and I'll never call her again  
Same room same hotel next week with her friend  
So Mr. Tell It I hope you linen (listen)  
Stay the fuck up out my business  
[Chorus]  
[Verse 3]  
Mr. Tell It don't shoot me down to knock a bitch  
Mr. Tell It don't use my name, remember you the shit  
I can't help I fucked your hoe, and yo 'cause, and yo sissta  
and yo ex-girl-lah  
Mr. Tell It want to pay be back, ain't that a bitch

Mr. Tell It these hoes already know that I'm a dawg  
Mr. Tell It can't say nuttin nice then don't speak at all  
Mr. Tell It quit bothering me, watching me  
Following like a private eye agency

Cause on the real, I don't want to put one in your dome  
So leave me alone

I was a young nigga thugging now, moms bugging now  
Getting the Third Degree, for bringin drugs in the house  
Getting my ass in, but my mama had to spoil it  
Ran across my work, flushed my shit down the toilet  
Fucked me up bad, but I tried to ignore it  
Couldn't though, why? 'cause I owed the nigga for it  
125 grams eight one yo-la, 50 doller power tell blue motorola  
Broke up my tube and my scale, I got no luck  
Hold up, mama even threw away the soda  
I remember this shit like it was yesterday  
Falling in the house late, seent the look on mama's face  
I knew something was wrong, by the smile and the smirk  
You know the look you get when your mama really hurt  
She shook her head, I dropped mine, ya'll already know  
Boy you selling dope, get your shit you got to go  
[Chorus repeat- X2]  
I'm on the motherfucking grind  
You think this easy, you out your motherfucking mind  
You could see the shit I'm doing, if you was blind  
Straight up, I'm just trying to get mine  
[Yo Gotti]  
What am I to do now, where am I to go?  
And how the fuck I'm gonna pay this nigga for his do?  
Been looking for me, got a nigga kind of scared  
And all the other niggaz looking up side my head  
They said he came through, layin low with his beeper  
Two, Three cars Two, Three Desert Eagles  
Got me a fresh quarter ounce and a beeper  
Fuck it, I'm a grind till my bank get steeper  
72 hours had 28 elither  
Know what I'm talking about that uncut ether  
Junkies lookin whoin, goose neckin and browsing  
Word got around, I sold up the Public Housing  
[Chorus]  
[Yo Gotti]  
One week later had 4 and a split  
Called up the nigga, told him told him come get his shit  
I'm a real nigga, I just ran into some problems  
All the time you think a nigga tried to slick rob ya  
Thinking about my mama and them, I'm ready to go home  
I'm fifteen years old, out here on my own  
Mama let me back in, mama real strict  
After school, straight home, no phone, no shit  
Now doom in my room, I assume I was broke and it's true  
So what the fuck a nigga gone do  
Called grip, I heard he just got back off a trip with that shit  
Man fuck it, I'm getting back with my click

"I call it thirst trap, shawty, oh!  
And you know, they say it's a man's job to respect a woman  
For me personal I feel like a woman supposed to give a man something for a man
to respect  
I ain't wrong for thinking that as I am wrong for thinking this!  
  
On me to buy you a bag, but is you worthy?  
Nah, I ain't perfect!  
And I just followed you on Instagram  
Are you really into women and that you get around?  
Now I ain't judging, I'm just asking if that's fair to say  
But either way, it's my opinion, you know give or take!  
I told this model chick,  
The girls look up to you and the things you do  
Every nigga you work with, you're screwing,  
So you know she will love you, you know she don't do it, she like  
You don't know me, you don't pay my bills  
You don't know my struggle,  
Like this she real, but it is what it is  
But I know you lying, I know what's real  
I know your worth, I know that purse  
Ten bandz, Shawty!  
You can't pay your bills, you're'  
  
I will give you the respect that you earn, that you earn  
What you make me do, that's what I'm gonna do to you!  
And I'm gonna give you the respect that you earn, that you earn  
Oh, what you make me do, that's what I'm gonna do  
Give you the respect you earn, that you earn!  
  
Uh, I kiss on your neck  
Do you wanna get out of this?  
Would you feel disrespected  
If I said you fat as shit?  
Wow, if I called you my bitch  
When I'm with my partners eating?  
As a badge of honor or just be like no Wale  
Don't call me out at my momma's given.  
Name sacred, she whispers mine when I'm in her thighs  
And I leave her inner feelings, cause I never leave her dry!  
Some ill advice, lying to her is ill advised  
She know these Jones on my John, but I still give her time.  
I try follow her, everybody want her  
Worried about none if she gonna work that body!  
And I unfollow her, though my eyes still on her'  
I'm still caught up, call her thirst trap shawty  
  
I will give you the respect that you earn, that you earn  
What you make me do, that's what I'm gonna do to you!  
Girl, I'm gonna give you the respect that you earn, that you earn  
Oh, what you make me do, that's what I'm gonna do  
Give you the respect you earn, that you earn!  
  
She lives for the night life, and that's alright  
But she wants to be treated like somebody's wife.  
But you can't be table hopping in a club trying to drink free  
Girl, come up to my table trying to stand next to me!  
Oh no, oh no, oh no  
  
Girl, I'm gonna give you the respect that you earn, that you earn  
What you make me do, that's what I'm gonna do  
Girl, I'm gonna give you the respect that you earn, that you earn  
What you make me do, that's what I'm gonna do  
Give you the respect that you earn, that you earn  
What you make me do, that's what I'm gonna do

A fourth spot for me and my shorty that stayed down  
The one who stayed strong and helped me through shady grounds

Hundred I shoot, hundred I hit,  
Five hundred ? nigga this my life  
Yo Gotti don't shit round me but my money get high  
If it's crap in the room, and it ain't a real goon  
Then you know soon that it ain't my guy  
Fifteen, sixteen, seventeen five  
Anything else, way too high  
Gucci, Louis that's all I buy  
way to high, need to come down  
Need a...  
Don't know me, don't know you  
...my hood, so don't come around.  
I'mma tell you like a nigger told me  
..might be OG  
That being said, that being told  
That's the first nigger in front of me,a whole key  
..put it in my hand, cause he know I wanna plan  
..he had to shoot me  
My testimony, my testimony, my testimony!  
My testimony, my testimony, my testimony!  
  
Yeah, I hear... inside the kitchen saying  
..why took 'em bitches  
..full of money.. but I kept the chopper  
..cha cha cha ain't no stopping me!

You know how these game goes  
This ? and they don't need to take my crown

"Tuesday night, I was laid up in the bed  
Tired as hell, I'm hearing voices in my head  
Heard some knocks, grabbed my tone, ran to the doe (door)  
Screamed, ""Who is it?"", but i ain't hear that shit no mo'  
Cocked my nine  
I went to peekin' out the blinds  
Thought it was fine  
But at a unexpected time  
The doe (door) flew in, I got a two-story home  
Seen 'em comin' wit they face masks on  
Bust the choppers, down the stairs, they hit the cut  
Two of them got away, but the other two got stuck  
Hit 'em again  
One in the neck, one in the chin  
Then called the Law and said I did they ass in  
Hook:  
OK, you want to play  
You say you know where I stay?  
Well, come today  
Bring yo bad ass on, I'm waitin on ya  
I got a K wit a motherfuckin' shank on it  
You bitch you  
OK, you want to play  
You say you know where I stay?  
Well, come today  
Bring yo bad ass on, I'm waitin on ya  
I got a K wit a motherfuckin' shank on it  
You bitch you  
Say whodie, you won't believe what happened to me  
A nigga all in my spot, and he askin' for me  
See I wouldn't at the spot, but my broad was there  
When she hit me on the phone, it's niggas in there  
They knocked me off for a bird and my platinum chain  
Them niggas from round there, they just doin' they thang  
I respect the game  
But they got to respect it, I ain't no hoe ass nigga  
I'm gone take car my business  
Next day, broad-daylight, rode the track  
The first nigga looked suspicious had to get in the back  
(Talking)  
Bitch, we ain't straight no mo'  
Hoe we used to have fun, we don't play no mo'  
Them niggas that you run wit, they kicked in my doe  
So I'm gone shoot you in yo face if you don't cough up that dope, bitch  
Hook  
This situation is a cold thang  
I got to explain  
Cause nigga this a cold game  
I was keeping my pounds at a spot in Raleigh  
But I was moving them thangs, like they was hot tamales  
Well, hot tamales, I played the cards I was dealt  
Because I knew befo' long that they'll hang they self  
I ain't no fool  
Nigga that's why I play it cool  
I know the shit you will and won't try to do  
But what you came in wit, that's what you left wit (AHH HAA)  
Because I'm three steps ahead, it's like you brainless  
I been fuckin' wit money, I been having birds  
I disassociated my self from bad nerves  
Cause once you under pressure, you'll bust trick  
And you the type of nigga that I can't trust bitch  
And the nigga that went, you just a send-out  
I tried to kill yo hoe ass, but you went out, the window, bitch

"Mama, we're gon' be aight  
Man, I miss my brother, I swear to God  
I'm still mad at myself that I couldn't take the charge  
I remember like yesterday, phone ringing up off the hook  
Pandemonium in the north, what happened to juk?  
Shit, I don't know, guess the same old bullshit  
Fed's said, DP got caught with half a brick  
That damn near stopped my heart  
'Cause me and knowing my brother I'm thinking this shit hard  
But luckily it was soft and fortunately he was straight  
We're findin' to take it to trial, but went on sign for eight  
Mama, we're gon' be straight, lil' sister we're gon' be cool  
I know that my brother strong, so I did what I had to do  
Mama, we're gon' be aight  
He gon' be okay  
Shit, I didn't know but I was walkin' on faith  
Li'l sister we're gon' be aight, he gon' be okay  
Got me a brick and started moving that weight  
Mama, we're gon' be aight  
He gon' be okay  
Shit, I didn't know but I was walkin' on faith  
Lil' sister we're gon' be aight, he gon' be okay  
Got me a brick and started moving that weight  
His sister taking it bad, mama trying to be strong  
Couple calendar years, I never shedded a tear  
Wrote him a couple letters to tell him I'm doin' better  
Told him, I took his Chevy and put the shit back together  
Told him, I'm gettin' money, I counted a hundred G's  
Told me to slow it down, play the shit low key  
Told me to make it happen, focus more on rappin'  
'Cause fuckin' round in these streets that anything can happen  
Told me I had heart, plus he knew I was smart  
The only thing that'd break his heart is  
If I fuck around and catch a charge  
Told me to watch my sister and never let mama suffer  
And do what I had to do to overcome the struggles  
Mama, we're gon' be aight  
He gon' be okay  
Shit, I didn't know but I was walkin' on faith  
Lil' sister we're gon' be aight, he gon' be okay  
Got me a brick and started moving that weight  
Mama, we're gon' be aight  
He gon' be okay  
Shit, I didn't know but I was walkin' on faith  
Lil' sister we're gon' be aight, he gon' be okay  
Got me a brick and started moving that weight  
Finally made parol, they think he gon' change his life  
I axed him what he gon' do, he said he's gon' walk light  
It wasn't a year later, he smokin' behind tint  
Half an ounce of the reddy rock, man they got his ass again  
Judge gave him a bond, now he out on the run  
With that fuck the world attitude, still totin' a gun  
Still havin' his fun, we clubbin' it on the weekend  
Thought I had conversations 'bout going to turn himself in  
Wanted to raise his son, gon' get the shit behind him  
Plus he knew it's only so long before they find him  
Lawyer was talking good, say he gon' get three  
When the prosecutor quit yellin' they gave my brother eleven  
My mama damn near fainter, my brother didn't want to accept it  
The hardest part for me, I couldn't do nothing to help it  
Rap shit paid off, now we all on TV  
My brother say, he good, he finally feel free  
Mama, we're gon' be aight  
He gon' be okay  
Shit, I didn't know but I was walkin' on faith  
Lil' sister we're gon' be aight, he gon' be okay  
Got me a brick and started moving that weight  
Mama, we're gon' be aight  
He gon' be okay  
Shit, I didn't know but I was walkin' on faith  
Lil' sister we're gon' be aight, he gon' be okay

Hand is on this choppa tek

Hand is on a hundred round cause thats how much the choppa shoot  
Ballin' is my hobby got a hundred goons shoppin'  
Gotta 5 star with me and i met her in the lobby  
Took her to the room, she hit me wit' that line  
Said she ain't that type of girl so I told her stop lyin'

Young money!

OK, I ain't gotta lie, cross my heart hope to die,  
If numbers don't lie, G-5 over sky,  
I fucked her pussy good, make her cry if I tried,  
I'm tired of being sick and I'm sick of being tired,  
Tired of these niggas and tired of these bitches,  
Shit let 'em lie as long as they ain't snitching,  
And men lie about women,  
And shit women lie about plenty, huh  
They ain't lying on me I'm in the bed with 2 fine bitches lying on me,  
So that would make 3 and numbers don't lie,

Hop in that Lamb, push the button, lose the ceiling  
Sun out no rain drops, postin' the same spot  
Right here in North, North Memphis  
Where I came from  
Hundred on the neck, I ain't never had shit  
The streets gave me family, Barry White cut the check  
Ain't no secret in the streets, niggas know I got next  
Got the swagger through the roof, I was born just to flex  
Zip code on my wrist, phone number in the bank  
In my ten til six with my 3-0-5 paint  
I got my 3-5-7 and my 5-0-1's  
In a Lear 55 wit' my Air Force One's (no lie)

I switch up my raps yo I never go the same way  
Plus I get a different prepaid every 30 days  
So if I get jam I know where it came from  
Rub my shit suitable never serve unusual  
All money ain't good and all money ain't fine

Some money can't spend and some money ain't safe
