"Calling, calling all angels, oh I'm calling, calling all angels  
  
The night was still, the moon was bright when he saw a distant light  
So he started walkin' till he found a church outside of town  
And he stumbled in and closed the door, said why I'm here, I'm not sure  
It's my baby that I'm lookin' for, can't she see I'm down on my knees  
  
I've been calling, calling all angels, bring my baby back  
Oh you must know where she's at, tell me what to do, I know she's one of you  
I'm down on my knees, tell her please, that I love her so  
  
Tell me preacher, man to man, will you do all that you can  
I've done wrong, this I know, and I really hurt her so  
It's a lonely world I'm livin' in, an ocean of tears I been cryin'  
In this greatest hour of need, what can be done for a fool like me  
  
Oh, I'm calling, calling all angels, bring my baby back  
Oh you must know where she's at, yes I've been a fool  
And I know that she's one of you, now do this for me, tell her please  
  
And if she's lonely I'll make her understand  
That these arms can carry both of us back to heaven again  
  
Yes I've been a fool and I know that she's one of you  
Do this for me, tell her please  
  
Calling, calling all angels  
Hear me calling, calling all angels  
Oh I'm calling, calling all angels  
Hear me calling, calling all angels

"Somewhere in the mountains......... In northern Alabama  
The Carolina lady waits for her man from Tennessee  
Somewhere in a motel...... Out in Oklahoma  
There's the Alabama dreamer  
That same man from Tennessee  
  
Sometime late at night...... The lonely wakes her gently  
And knocks at her door...... But she won't give in  
But like every other woman........ She needs to feel wanted  
She thinks of making love....... And goes to sleep again  
  
Carolina......... Dreamin' lonely  
Carolina......... Can't you see  
You will always be the lady.....  
That I dream of holding tight.....  
That I kiss and tell goodnight.....  
Carolina....... Mountain dewe  
  
Sometime that next day..... On a Mississippi freeway  
The Alabama dreamer........ Is homeward bound  
His conscious is as clear........ As those green eyes of Carolina  
And she's waiting with the baby from the love.............. Of the only man to  
Lay her down  
  
Carolina.......... Dreaming lonely  
Carolina.......... Can't you see  
You will always be the lady  
That I dream of holding tight  
That I kiss and tell goodnight

"It was almost Christmas time  
There I stood in another line  
Tryin to buy that last gift or two  
Not really in the Christmas mood  
  
Standin right in front of me  
Was a little boy waiting anxiously  
Pacing round like little boys do  
And in his hands he held a pair of shoes  
  
And his clothes were worn and old  
He was dirty from head to toe  
And when it came his time to pay  
I couldn't believe what I heard him say  
  
Sir, I wanna buy these shoes  
For my mama, please  
Its Christmas eve and these shoes are just her size  
Could you hurry, sir?  
Daddy says theres not much time  
You see, shes been sick for quite a while  
And I, know these shoes will make her smile  
And I, want her to look beautiful  
If mama meets Jesus tonight  
  
He counted pennies for what seemed like years  
And the, cashier said Son, theres not enough here.  
He searched his pockets franticly  
Then he turned and he looked at me  
He said Mama made Christmas good at our house  
Most years she just did without  
Tell me, sir, what am I gonna do  
Somehow I've gotta buy her these Christmas shoes  
  
So I laid the money down  
I just had to help him out  
And Ill never forget the look on his face  
When he said Mamas gonna look so great  
  
Sir, I wanna buy these shoes  
For my mama, please

As he thanked me and ran out  
I knew that god had sent that little boy to remind me  
What Christmas is all about

Round our house the grass was green,  
It didn't seem like things were all that bad,  
  
I bet we walked a thousand miles,  
Choppin' cotton and pusing plows,  
And learnin' how to give it all we had.  
  
As Life went on and years went by,  
I saw the light in daddy's eye,  
And felt the love in mamma's hands,  
They kept us warm and kept us fed,  
Taught us how to look ahead,  
Now lookin' back I understand.  
  
We were walkin' in high cotton,  
Old times there are not forgotten,  
Those fertile fields are never far away,  
We were walkin' in high cotton,  
Old time there are not forgotten,  
Leavin' home was the hardest thing we ever faced.

We dressed up hand-me-downs,  
Just in time to gather with the church,  
Some times I think how long It's been,  
And how it impressed me then,  
It was the only day my daddy wouldn't work.

Lock me away, inside of your love

"Once upon a lifetime  
I looked in someone's eyes

For the very first time  
She was scared and young  
And had never tasted love  
So I took her by the hand  
And a boy became a man

As the cards begin to fall  
And the lesson learned is hard  
You're only dealt the Queen of Cards

A broken heart's a high price to pay  
Foolish ways will make fools of the wise  
And the best things seldom come along twice  
  
Once upon a lifetime  
You know that you've been blessed  
When you hold your first born tenderly against your chest  
  
And through the innocence you see  
The value of a family  
And you feel a special bond  
That only comes along

"They married back in '32  
They were young and love was new  
And every day the feeling grew  
Between the two of them  
When work grew scarce and times got bad  
The hope would chase away the sad  
And hope was sometimes all they had  
Between the two of them  
The 40's came and the 50's went  
And the mortgage replaced the rent  
They made the most of each day spent  
Between the two of them  
Their children all turned out just fine  
So he retired in '69  
And left with oh so little time  
Between the two of them  
Today I brave the graveyard rain  
And placed a rose between their names  
Now that's the most that ever came  
Between the two of them  
And though I miss them oh so much  
His crooked smile her gentle touch  
And the pleasure of just growing up  
Between the two of them

"In a cloud of dust cross Texas, south of San Antone  
The lawman and the cowboy pushed their horses on  
Racin' toward the Rio running out of time  
They had to catch the outlaws before they crossed the borderline.  
  
Well, the lawman wanted justice the cowboy revenge  
They tracked the Outlaws' horses up to the river's edge  
And there across the Rio a badge ain't worth a dime  
The law was in their own hands once they crossed the borderline.  
  
So they ride to the desert wind down a dusty trail, destiny begins  
Heroes never turn or look back  
They just ride through the sands of time on the borderline  
  
In the safety of the badlands the outlaws stopped their run  
The campfire rings with laughter of evil things they've done  
How they'd taken all they wanted and killed the cowboy's wife  
And knew no one would follow them, cross the borderline.  
  
The lawman and the cowboys stepped out of the dark  
And it was two against the twenty and every bullet found its mark  
And so goes the legend that out there in the night  
The two still ride together somewhere beyond the borderline.  
  
So they ride to the desert wind, down a dusty trail, destiny begins  
Heroes never turn or look back  
They just ride through the sands of time on the borderline.

"Is the magic still there whenever I hold you?  
Do these lips of mine send chills down your spine  
Like they used to?  
Or is it slipping away? Baby, come out and say  
I'm asking because I care  
I just need to know is the magic still there  
Oh I still recall our first time together  
Oh we kissed and we touched, we couldn't get enough of each other  
And when we said goodnight beneath that old porch light  
It left us wanting more  
But I'm wondering now if time has somehow  
Changed what we felt before  
Is the magic still there whenever I hold you?  
Do these lips of mine send chills down your spine  
Like they used to?  
Or is it slipping away? Baby come out and say  
I'm asking because I care  
I just need to know is the magic still there  
Am I still the one that you daydream of?  
When we turn out the light, is there fire in the night  
When we make love?  
Don't want to take you for granted so baby I'm askin'  
Only because I care  
I just want to know

"When I was a lad and old Shep was a pup  
Over hills and meadows we'd stray  
Just a boy and his dog, we were both full of fun  
We grew up together that way  
  
I remember the time at the old mill pond  
When I would've drowned beyond doubt  
But old Shep was right there, to the rescue he came  
He jumped in and helped pull me out  
  
As, the years passed and rolled, at last he grew old  
And his eyesight was fast growing dim.  
Then one day the doctor looked at me and said  
I can't do no more for him, Jim?  
  
I went to his side and sat on the ground  
And laid his old head on my knee  
Well, he was the best friend that I ever had  
I cried so I scarcely could see  
  
Old Sheppie he knew, he was going to go  
For he reached out and licked at my hand  
He looked up at me, just as much as to say  
We're parting but you understand  
  
Now old Sheppie is gone where the good doggies go  
And no more with old Shep will I roam  
But if dogs have a heaven, there's one thing for sure  
Old Shep has a wonderful home

A man and wife had prayed for years for children  
Were losing faith and close to giving up  
Then a young girl with no way to keep her baby  
Laid in their arms a tiny gift of love  
  
It only takes one life to make a miracle  
One tiny ray of hope to light up the dark  
It only takes one life to make a miracle  
One honest prayer coming from the heart  
  
A small coal mining town in West Virginia  
Prayed as they kept vigil day and night  
Saddened by the twelve who lives were taken  
But also thankful one made it out alive  
  
It only takes one life to make a miracle  
One tiny ray of hope to light up the dark  
It only takes one life to make a miracle  
One honest prayer coming from the heart  
  
Two thousand years ago the world lay waiting  
For the Savior they were told would come  
Then on that winter night there in a manger  
God blessed the world with his one and only son  
  
It only takes one life to make a miracle  
One tiny ray of hope to light up the dark  
It only takes one life to make a miracle  
One honest prayer coming from the heart

"(Spoken)  
I was born and raised down in Alabama  
On a farm way back up in the woods  
I was so ragged that folks used to call me Patches  
Papa used to tease me about it  
Of course deep down inside he was hurt  
'Cause he done all he could  
  
(Sang)  
Papa was a great old man  
I can see him with a shovel in his hand  
See, education he never had  
He did wonders when the time got bad  
The little money from the crops he raised  
Barely paid the bills he made  
So life had kicked him down to the ground  
When he tried to get up  
Life would kick him back down  
One day papa called me to his dyin bed  
Put his hands on my shoulders  
Then with a tears he said  
Patches, I'm depending on you son  
To pull the family through  
My son, it's all left up to you  
  
(Spoken)  
Two days later papa passed away  
And I became a man that day  
So I told mama I was gonna quit school  
She said that was daddy's strictest rule  
  
(Sang)  
So every morning 'fore I went to school  
I fed the chickens and I chopped wood too  
Sometimes I felt that I couldn't go on  
I wanted to leave just run away from home  
But I always remembered what my daddy said  
With tears in his eyes on his dyin bed  
He said, ""Patches, I'm depending on you son  
To pull the family through  
My son, it's all left up to you  
  
(Spoken)  
Then one day a strong rain came  
And washed all the crops away  
And at the age of thirteen I thought I was carrying  
The weight of the whole world on my shoulders  
But you know, mama she knew what I was going through,  
  
(Sang)  
Everyday I had to work the fields  
'Cause that's the only way we got our meals  
You see, I was the oldest of a family  
And everybody else depended on me  
Every night I heard my mama pray  
Lord, give him the strength to make another day  
Though years have passed and all the kids are grown  
And amgels took my mama to a brand new home  
Lord knows people that I she'd a tear  
My daddy's voice kept a-tinging in my ears  
Sayin, ""Patches, I'm depending on you son  
To pull the family through  
My son, it's all left up to you...  
  
Patches, I'm depending on you son  
I'm depending on you son  
To pull the family through

Oh, John Dillon James was my good time country buddy  
Well, we hunted, talked and fished his last days away  
He was just a hired farm hand, worked old man Walker's land  
Retired on his 68th birthday  
Yeah, he wore a size sixteen shoe, had skin like alligator  
Lord, he could pick up a deer and walk right out of those woods  
Old Dillon had a million tales but he sung me one refrain  
And I recall that song by John Dillon James  
  
One July Monday morning I met him at the fishing hole  
But old Dillon wasn't toting his half pint of tin hide  
His roll your own tobacco string was a-hanging from his pocket  
His eyes were red as beets, looked like he cried  
And I know he sat on knees cause his overalls were muddy  
But my ten year old mind didn't understand  
He sat down on the bank and wrote this four line refrain  
And I recall that song by John Dillon James  
  
Well, I got my ticket for the ride in the sky  
I've been talking to the man, I'm gonna fly  
Paid the price down on my knees  
A voice from heaven promised me  
I got my ticket for the ride in the sky  
  
Well, it was one year to the day on a July Monday morning  
I waited at the fishing hole but old Dillon, he didn't show  
Daddy came down about noon, and said  
Son, I've got some news  
Lord's rested old Dillon's soul  
Yeah, and I walked up to his bedside  
Looked down at old big Dillon  
Lord knows that I saw a pair of wings  
That tables set but I felt good, for at last I understood  
That refrain sung by John Dillon James  
  
Well, I got my ticket for the ride in the sky, Lord, y'all  
I've been talking to the man, I'm gonna fly (I'm gonna fly)

Give and take, holding back for Heaven's sake  
And fighting for a week and making up

"It's just a little bitty pissant country place  
Ain't nothin' much to see  
No drinking allowed, we get a nice quiet crowd, plain as it can be  
It's just a piddly squatin' old time country place  
Ain't nothing to hide at all  
Just lots of good will and maybe one small thrill  
But there's nothing dirty going on  
Nothing dirty going on  
We get simple farmers, local business men  
Congress folks from Austin, young boys looking for sin  
Now we used to get a lot of rough necks, when the oil boom was high  
But pay day would get a little rowdy, thank God the field ran dry

I don't hire no married girl, they're not on the ball  
They got homes and husbands, they're not stable at all  
You know they don't understand a thing about a proper business day

Keep your language clean girls, keep your bedrooms neat  
And don't hang around the town cafe and say hi on the street

Yea every girl that lives here knows Miss Mona's no-no rules

You better get here double quick

Pimps are something you don't need  
To get your daily business done  
Are you listening good?  
Keep them leaches and blood suckers of the bathrobes  
And I know how to use a gun  
And nobody messes with my girls  
  
And any questions you might have about the way I run this place  
Don't grip and whine behind my back  
Just tell me face to face, I'm open-minded, say it all

I was thinking about what a friend had said  
I was hoping it was a lie  
Thinking about what a friend had said  
I was hoping it was a lie  
  
Well I dreamed I saw the silver spaceships flyin'  
In the yellow haze of the sun  
There was laughing, crying and colors flying  
All around the chosen one  
  
All in a dream, all in a dream, the loading had begun  
Flying mother nature's silver seed to a new home in the sun  
They were flying mother nature's silver seed to a new home

To keep this Mobile girl from feelin' fine

Lord, what I'd give to see an Alabama sundown  
The sun just seemed to drop in Mobile Bay  
New York town has got a gifted way to keep a girl down  
But that never was the Mobile way, no, no  
That never was the Mobile way  
  
A flashing sign says that you can rent a bed for just a dollar  
In anybody's town, that price is cheap  
It's a shame to know a girl would ever fall down to my standards  
Cause I need ninety cents to go to sleep

"Back through the years  
I go wanderin' once again  
Back to the seasons of my youth  
I recall a box of rags that someone gave us  
And how my momma put the rags to use  
There were rags of many colors  
Every piece was small  
And I didn't have a coat  
And it was way down in the fall  
Momma sewed the rags together  
Sewin' every piece with love  
She made my coat of many colors  
That I was so proud of  
As she sewed, she told a story  
From the bible, she had read  
About a coat of many colors  
Joseph wore and then she said  
I hope this coat will bring you  
Good luck and happiness  
And I just couldn't wait to wear it  
And momma blessed it with a kiss  
  
My coat of many colors  
That my momma made for me  
Made only from rags  
But I wore it so proudly  
Although we had no money  
I was rich as I could be  
In my coat of many colors  
My momma made for me  
  
So with patches on my britches  
And holes in both my shoes  
In my coat of many colors  
I hurried off to school  
Just to find the others laughing  
And making fun of me  
And my coat of many colors  
My momma made for me  
  
And oh I couldn't understand it  
For I felt I was rich  
And I told them of the love  
My momma sewed in every stitch  
And I told 'em all the story  
Momma told me while she sewed  
And how my coat of many colors  
Was worth more than all their clothes  
  
But they didn't understand it  
And I tried to make them see  
That one is only poor  
Only if they choose to be  
Now I know we had no money  
But I was rich as I could be  
In my coat of many colors  
My momma made for me  
Made just for me

I think you should dump the dude  
  
I don't know why you'd want to settle for less  
When you could have so much more  
You know that you deserve only the best  
So what are you waiting for?  
  
Go on and dump the dude

She's been there, God knows, she's been there  
She has seen and done it all  
She's a woman, she know how to  
Dish it out or take it all  
Her heart's as soft as feathers  
Still she weathers stormy skies  
And she's a sparrow when she's broken  
But she's an eagle when she flies  
  
A kaleidoscope of colors  
You can toss her around and round  
You can keep her in you vision  
But you'll never keep her down  
She's a lover, she's a mother  
She's a friend and she's a wife  
And she's a sparrow when she's broken  
But she's an eagle when she flies  
  
Gentle as the sweet magnolia  
Strong as steel, her faith and pride  
She's an everlasting shoulder  
She's the leaning post of life  
She hurts deep and when she weeps  
She's just as fragile as a child  
And she's a sparrow when she's broken  
But she's an eagle when she flies  
  
She's a sparrow when she's broken  
But she's an eagle when she flies  
Oh, bless her, Lord  
She's an eagle when she flies

"I open up my door to greet the early morning sun  
Closing it behind me and away I do run  
To the meadow where the meadow lark  
Is singing in the tree  
In the meadow I go walking  
In the early morning breeze  
  
I cup my hands to catch a multi-colored butterfly  
Perched upon the petals of flowers growing wild  
Freeing it I watch it as it flies away from me

Rainbow colored flowers kissed with early morning sun  
The aster and the dahlia and wild geraniums  
Drops of morning dew still lingers on the iris leaves

"Being born was the worse and the first mistake I ever made  
The doctor didn't spank me, he just slapped me in the face  
And the cup of love was always quenching someone else's thirst  
Leaving me to swallow the bitter taste of hurt  
'Cause I was raised an orphan  
Never wanted as a kid until the year I turned 13  
Then everybody did, strangers pass me back and forth  
Men just took me as they pleased  
And others had a Cinderella slave to cook and clean and weep  
  
Though the deck is stacked against you  
Win or lose, you have to play  
The hand a life has dealt you  
And It's a gamble either way  
  
On a dust road at 15 in a yellow cotton dress  
With the desert sun like an angry dragon breathing down my neck  
And the dry cracked plains would make me think of a prehistoric time  
Or should I fear what lay before me less than what I'd left behind  
A 15 year old girl don't have no trouble hitching rides  
But sometimes when you're riding free  
You'll pay the highest price  
On back roads and in back seats  
And in a cheap highway motel  
But what's a few more strangers in a life of nothing else  
  
Though the deck is stacked against you  
Win or lose, you have to play  
The hand a life has dealt you  
And It's a gamble either way  
  
16 caught me crying, underneath the scarlet light  
On the door steps of a stranger on a cold and rainy night  
When I walked into the parlour here  
Other pieces seemed to fit  
I was good at pleasing strangers  
So I made the most of it  
  
Either way it's all a gamble  
So view the stakes and know the odds  
And lay your cards upon the table  
Do all the dealing from the top  
  
Though the deck is stacked against you  
Win or lose, you have to play  
The hand a life has dealt you  
And It's a gamble either way

Farmer's daughter if you will  
And I often wonder still  
In memories where I rammbled as a child  
Makes me cry and makes me laugh  
My reflections on the past  
And the family, friends, and faith that shaped my life  
Ragged clothes and hand-me-downs  
Just enough to go around  
But the sweetest things in life are always free  
Like the songs the birds would sing  
And the sweet new grass of spring  
And the sacred blossoms on the dogwood tree  
Repeat Chorus  
And I recall the thrill and joy  
Of a Smokey Mountain boy  
I remember my first kiss and my first love  
And the songs I'd song and write  
And the dreams I'd clutch so tight  
And the loved ones that gave me that extra shove  
And in that little house 'a prayer  
Where I spent many hour  
Prassin' God and liftin' up His name  
And asking Him to lead and to keep watch over me  
As I headed up that rocky road to fame  
And now this, Smokey Mountain girl has been all around the world  
But it makes no difference just how far I roam  
I still cling to that part that is so dear to my heart  
My faith in God and memories of home

To sweep her up and carry her away  
Oh but he don't have no magic ways to charm her  
No cause even love can't change a cowboy's ways  
""I love you"" and ""I'm sorry"" are words that just don't come  
Cause words like that are no match for the kind that rule his tongue  
But his eyes keep tellin' her ""you know I love you anyway  
No matter what I say or what I never say""

Hangin' all over me in a crowd  
'Cause people like to talk  
Lord, don't they love to talk  
But when they turn out the lights  
I know he'll be leavin' with me  
  
And when we get behind closed doors  
Then we let out hair hang down  
Then he makes me glad that he's my man  
And no one knows what goes on behind closed doors  
  
My baby makes me smile  
Lord, don't he make me smile  
I'm never far away  
Or too tired to say I want to  
I'm purring like a kitten  
When he's out in public with me  
But when they turn out the lights  
He brings out the tiger in me  
  
And when we get behind closed doors  
Then we let out hair hang down  
Then he makes me glad that he's my man  
And no one knows what goes on behind closed doors

"Who do you think you are  
What do you think this is  
A game you can play tryin' to steal him away  
Well I don't need a heartache like this  
Well don't think I don't go through hell  
But heaven is what we both want  
He's easy to love but he's hard to give up  
And if you think I will well you're wrong  
The best woman wins I will fight 'til the end  
I'll lay down and die if I must  
I'll beg and I'll plead I will suffer and bleed  
But he must make a choice between us  
This soap opera play that we're in  
Is just like you watch on t.v.  
But I never thought that I'd ever get caught in it  
Starring you him and me  
In love as in war all is fair  
So a fight to the finish begins  
When you fight from desire you fight fire with fire  
So may the best woman win  
The best woman wins I will fight 'til the end  
I'll lay down and die if I must  
I'll beg and I'll plead I will suffer and bleed

With all you do, your attitude

Well, I'm not the Dalai Lama, but I'll try  
To offer up a few words of advice  
  
[Chorus]  
You better get to livin', givin'  
Don't forget to throw in a little forgivin'  
And lovin' on the way  
You better get to knowin', showin'  
A little bit more concerned about where you're goin'  
Just a word unto the wise  
You better get to livin'  
  
A girlfriend came to my house  
Started cryin' on my shoulder Sunday evening  
She was spinnin' such a sad tale  
I could not believe the yarn that she was weavin'  
So negative the words she had to say  
I said if I had a violin I'd play  
  
I said you'd better get to livin', givin'  
Be willing and forgivin'  
Cause all healing has to start with you  
You better stop whining, pining  
Get your dreams in line  
And then just shine, design, refine  
Until they come true  
  
And you better get to livin'  
  
Your life's a wreck, your house is mess  
And your wardrobe way outdated  
All your plans just keep on falling through  
Overweight and under paid, under appreciated  
I'm no guru, but I'll tell you  
This I know is true.  
  
You better get to livin', givin'  
A little more thought about bein'  
A little more willin' to make a better way  
Don't sweat the small stuff  
Keep your chin up  
Just hang tough  
And if it gets too rough  
Fall on your knees and pray  
And do that everyday  
Then you'll get to livin'  
  
The day we're born we start to die  
Don't waste one minute of this life  
Get to livin'  
Share your dreams and share your laughter  
Make some points for the great hereafter  
  
Better start carin'  
Better start sharin'  
Better start tryin'  
Better start smiling  
And you better get to livin'...

We were so close once upon a time

And all them possum grapes and muskedines  
And do you recall the time  
We all got drunk on homemade wine  
That was in the better part  
Of life we left behind  
  
Life was simple for us then

"(Dolly Parton)  
In my home town of Blackie, Kentucky  
He came passin' through one dark, gloomy day  
And I considered myself as lucky  
When he told me he would take me away  
And though he was older, it made me no difference  
His promise of riches was all I could see  
At last I could leave the coal mines of Kentucky  
And know something better than sad poverty  
Blackie, Kentucky, you know that I'll miss you  
But there are other places in the world I'd like to see  
So I must take this chance to be somethin' more than nothin'  
But I'll always hold you in my memory  
But I've never adjusted to sociable livin'  
The friends that he knows, they're all strangers to me  
Thousands of miles from Blackie, Kentucky  
In a mansion with a husband that never loved me  
He won't let my family and friends come to visit  
Because they are country and poor, he's ashamed  
Oh, but I'd give my life, Lord, if I could just go see them  
All that's changed about me is my name  
Blackie, Kentucky, oh Lord, how I miss you  
If I could come back home, I'd never leave you anymore  
I'd like to see my poor, hardworking, coal-minin' Daddy  
And Mama, and the kids, and the friends I knew before  
My world is as black as the coal in Kentucky  
He won't let me leave him - there's no way to win  
I'll take my own life, dear God, please forgive me  
But I've got to get back home to Blackie once again  
An' I've left him a note, in the mornin' he'll find it  
It's my last request and he can't refuse me  
I've told him to bury me back in Blackie, Kentucky  
Where my family and my friends can come and visit me  
Blackie, Kentucky I'm comin' home to you  
But different from the way you remember me before  
So make me a place and I'll lay me down to rest  
And I'll sleep in your arms forevermore  
I'll sleep in your arms forever more

No satisfaction with these blues hangin' 'round

"She was born in a place called Blue Valley  
At the foot of the Tennessee hills  
With the blue birds and blue bells  
And blue mountain water  
And the sound of the Blue Whippoorwill  
But there was no peace in the valley  
Her daddy, a cruel, ruthless man  
Used and abused her mind and her body  
So her mama said run while you can  
So at fifteen she took to the highway  
Belongings and guitar in hand  
And she buried herself in her music  
The one thing she did understand  
  
And she sings like a bird and she writes like a poet  
Her voice has that high, lonesome sound  
She hurts, and her songs are the best way to show it  
So the Blue Valley songbird keeps traveling around  
  
She hopes someday she will make it  
And everyone says that she will  
When she comes to town, crowds flock around  
To see the girl from the Tennessee hills  
She writes her letter back home to her mama  
In care of the preacher in town  
They're sacred to her so she reads them at church  
And so her daddy cannot track her down  
  
And she sings like a bird and she cries like a baby  
Whenever she turns off the lights  
She's a whole lot lonesome and a little bit crazy  
From mem'ries and miseries and dreams gone awry  
  
Blue dress, blue shoes, a blue Cadillac  
A band dressed in blue by her side  
Instruments tied to the top and the back  
'Cause the Blue Valley songbird is singing tonight  
  
One nighters, honky tonks, years flying by  
She never made it, but Lord knows she tries  
Expressing the feelings she holds inside  
And the Blue Valley songbird is singing tonight  
Oh the Blue Valley songbird is singing tonight  
  
And she sings like a bird and she writes like a poet

I was lookin' for greener pastures  
When I left my old Kentucky home  
I was chasin' after dreams I thought I'd master  
So I left the one that loved me all along  
Thinkin' only of myself and doin' better  
Didn't care about the grief I left behind  
Didn't even make a card or write a letter  
So sure I'd be successful in no time  
Now I'm heading for bluer pastures  
And back to the one who's heart I broke  
To the bluegrass state of Kentucky  
Where he waits with open for me I hope  
Ain't it funny how you are when you're younger?  
How what you have is never good enough  
How the years will find you searchin' through your plunder  
Lookin' for the treasures you gave up  
Well the seasons came, they went  
The dreams all shattered  
While the grass just stayed a lonely shade of brown  
Then I realized I'd lost all that had mattered  
So with foolish pride aside, I'm homeward bound  
Now I'm heading for bluer pastures  
And back to the one who's heart I broke  
To the bluegrass state of ole Kentucky  
Where he waits with open for me I hope  
Now I'm heading for bluer pastures  
Where the bluegrass waves sweetly in the wind  
Where the bluegrass music's always playin'  
To the haunting sound of Monroe's mandolin  
I'm heading for bluer pastures

I would let my gentle bosom  
Be a pillow for your head  
I'd caress your perfect body  
On a rosy bed at night  
Play you love songs on a golden harp  
And sing you Butterflies  
In a diamond-studded chalice  
On an emerald-plated tray  
I would bring to you sweet nectar  
And gifts of bright array  
I would paint for you a castle  
In a blue and yellow sky  
Paint you happy ever after  
And paint you Butterflies  
Butterflies, my heart flutters with the notion  
I get high on the wings of sweet emotion  
Darling I, I just think of you and I get butterflies  
I get close to you and I get butterflies  
If only I were magic  
I would make the wishes true  
I would wave a magic wand  
And be in Paradise with you  
But I'm just a girl that loves you  
I will love you all my life  
But I do have a magic feeling  
And it gives me butterflies  
Butterflies, my heart flutters with the notion  
I get high on the wings of sweet emotion  
Darling I, I just think of you and I get butterflies  
We should fly away together, you and I  
Off to paradise forever, I get high  
I get close to you and I get butterflies  
I think of you and I get butterflies  
I will spin for you a blanket out of gold and silver threads  
If only I were magic, I would make the wishes true  
I would wave a magic wand and be in paradise with you

In a dream I was walkin' in a beautiful field  
I was gathering flowers at the foot of a hill  
When a bright light descended and it spread o'er the land  
Jesus stood on the mountain and He held out His hand  
Then He came down from the mountain, headed down to the sea  
And the children strowed flowers in the path at His feet  
And He was filled with compassion and the beasts from the wild  
Came as gentle as lambs and they all walked at His side  
There's a calm on the water, a hush in the crowd  
There's peace in the valley, there's a stillness about  
There's a light in the darkness, there's joy in His love  
Ain't that a wonderful feelin', let us lift Him up  
Then He suddenly vanished from the crowd down below  
Reappeared on the mountain in a radiant glow  
He said your questions are many but the answer is love  
I'll draw all men unto me if I be lifted up  
There's a calm on the water, a hush in the crowd  
There's peace in the valley, there's a stillness about  
There's a light in the darkness, there's joy in His love  
There is life everlasting, let us lift Him up  
He said if I  
Be lifted up  
He said if I be lifted up, what did he say  
He said if I  
Be lifted up  
He said if I be lifetd up  
Let's lift Him higher and higher  
And higher and higher each day  
Let's lift Him up  
He said if I  
Be lifted up  
Oh if I be lifted up  
There's a calm on the water, a hush in the crowd  
There's peace in the valley, there's a stillness about  
There's a light in the darkness, and joy in His love  
It's a wonderful feelin', lift Him up  
He said if I  
Be lifted up  
He said if I be lifted up, that's what he said  
He said if I

"I got in a little trouble at the county seat  
Lord, they put me in the jailhouse

Well, the judge said guilty  
He made his point  
He said forty-five dollars

No money down

I found a telephone number on a laundry slip  
I had a good, hardy jailor  
With a six gun hip  
He let me call long distance  
She said, ""Number, please""  
And just as soon as I told her  
She shouted back at me  
  
Said that'll be cash on the barrelhead, hun  
Not part, not half  
But the entire sum  
No money down  
No credit line

Thirty days in the jailhouse  
Four days on the road

My feet, a heavy load  
I saw a Greyhound comin'  
Stuck out my thumb  
As soon as I was seated  
The driver caught my arm  
  
Said that'll be cash on the barrelhead, hun  
This old, grey dog gets paid to run  
When the engine starts  
And the wheels will roll  
Give me cash on the barrelhead

My jealousy, these endless fights  
I've got to get out of your life

I guess I'll die a bit each day  
But I'm always dying anyway  
And I don't have the heart to  
Stay, and I can't take the pain  
I know we've tried to no avail  
Our heaven now has  
Turned to hell  
The same old hurt  
We know so well  
And something's got  
To change  
We both know it's got to end  
The passion's gone  
It's just pretend  
And one of us have got  
To make the move  
We might as well just give it up  
We've lost respect and  
There's no trust  
And without this, there's  
No real love  
It's just some sad excuse  
I guess I'll die a bit each day  
But I'm always dying anyway  
And there's nothing left but walk away  
Ain't this a crying shame  
A change of pace  
A change of heart  
A change of place  
A place to start  
And we'll be better off apart  
Our only chance is change  
And we never wil  
But something has to change  
But someday when I'm over you  
And when I think I'm able to

From daddy's moonshine still  
My bootlegging daddy was known quite well  
And he made our home a livin' hell  
And I ain't forgot it and I know that I never will

They say you're no good so baby do what you should

"(Dolly Parton)  
Our love affair is bitter sweet  
Insecure and incomplete  
And I've often wondered why your leaving's been so long delayed  
It's all become so complicated  
Maybe you feel obligated  
And out of simpathy for me you stay  
But I had rather live alone  
Than live with someone who doesn't love me  
And I'd rather have you go than stay  
And put me down a thinkin' you're above me  
Our love affair is so wound up  
It's best that we unwind  
And if you don't love me, leave me  
And don't let it trouble your mind  
You've waited much too long to leave afraid of how I'd take it  
And I'm deeply touched by your concern but I think I can make it  
It won't be easy for a while but I'll forget in time  
And if you don't love me, leave me and don't let it trouble your mind  
I had rather live alone  
Than live with someone who doesn't love me  
And I'd rather have you go than stay  
And put me down a-thinkin' you're above me  
Our love affair is so wound up  
It's best that we unwind  
And if you don't love me, leave me  
And don't let it trouble your mind

"I'm tempted, my darlin' to steal you away  
Don't let me cross over, stay out of my way  
'Cause you know that I love you and I'm not the stealin' kind  
But I'm faced with heartache here at love's cheating line  
Don't let me cross over love's cheating line  
You belong to another and can never be mine  
I know one step closer would be heaven divine  
Don't let me cross over love's cheating line  
I've tried to forget you but what else can I do  
When your eyes keep saying that you want me too  
And I know if I lose you not a dream will I have left  
I don't want to cheat, dear but I can't help myself  
Don't let me cross over love's cheating line  
You belong to another and can never be mine  
I know one step closer would be heaven divine  
Don't let me cross over love's cheating line  
Don't let me cross over love's cheating line

It don't matter anyhow  
Ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe

Look out your window and I'll be gone  
You are the reason I'm traveling home

That night, I never know  
Ain't no use in turning on your light, babe

Still I wish there was something you would do or say

We never did too much talking anyway

Well, I'm thinking and wondering while I'm way down on the road

I gave him my heart, but he wanted my soul  
Don't think twice, it's alright  
  
Walking down that lone lonesome road, babe  
Where I'm bound I can't tell  
But goodbye is too good away, babe  
So I'm gonna say farewell  
  
But I ain't saying you treated me unkind  
You could have loved me better, but no, I don't mind

When I get my life back in order again  
Well I'll still be willing to help out my friends

"(Dolly Parton)  
I know this dress I'm wearing doesn't hide the secret I've tried concealing  
When he left he promised me he'd be back by the time it was revealing  
The sun behind a cloud just casts the crawling shadow o'er the fields of
clover  
And time is running out for me, I wish that he would hurry down from Dover  
He's been gone so long, when he left the snow was deep upon the ground  
And I have seen a spring and summer pass and now the leaves are turning brown  
At any time a tiny face will show itself 'cause waiting's almost over  
But I won't have a name to give it if he doesn't hurry down from Dover, from
Dover, from Dover  
My folks weren't understanding, when they found out they sent me from the home
place  
My daddy said if folks found out he'd be ashamed to ever show his face  
My mamma said I was a fool, she did not believe it when I told her  
Momma, everything's gonna be all right 'cause soon he would be coming down
from Dover  
I found a place to stay out on a farm takin' care of that old lady  
She never asked me nuthin' so I never talked to her about my baby  
I sent a messgae to my mom with a name and address of Ms. ol' Grover  
And to make sure he got that information when he came down from Dover  
I loved him more than anything and I could not refuse him when he needed me  
He was the only one I'd loved and I just can't believe that he was usin' me  
He wouldn't leave me here like this, I know it can't be so, it can't be over  
He wouldn't make me go through this alone, he'll be coming down from Dover  
My body aches the time is here it's lonely in this place where I'm lying  
Our baby has been born, but something's wrong, it's too still, I hear no
crying  
I guess in some strange way she knew she'd never have a father's arms to hold
her  
So dying was her way of tellin' me he wasn't coming down from Dover, from
Dover, from Dover  
Down from Dover

"When you're alone and life is making you lonely  
You can always go downtown  
When you got worries, all the noise and the hurry  
Seems to help, I know, downtown  
  
Just listen to the music of the traffic in the city  
Linger on the sidewalks where the neon signs are pretty  
How can you lose?  
The lights are much brighter there  
You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares  
  
And go downtown  
Things'll be great when you're downtown  
No finer place for sure, downtown  
Everything's waiting for you  
  
Don't hang around and let your problems surround you  
There are movie shows, downtown  
Or maybe you know some little places to go to  
Where they never close, downtown  
  
Just listen to the rhythm of the music that they're playin'  
Making conversation while you're on the dance floor swayin'  
Happy again  
The lights are much brighter there  
You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares

Where all the lights are bright, downtown  
Waiting for you tonight, downtown  
You're gonna be alright now  
  
And you may find somebody kind to help and understand you  
Someone who is just like you and needs a gentle hand to guide them along

You can forget all your troubles  
Just forget all your cares

This morning when I opened my eyes  
There to my surprise  
Lay that angel I thought had been only a dream  
And so I said a little prayer  
And thanked God, that he was there  
Oh, this is a dream come true  
Dream do come true  
I know 'cause I found you  
I never thought they did  
But now I do  
Dreams do come true

And it was love all night  
And the way he made love to me  
Fulfilled all my fantasies  
Ooo, this is a dream come true  
Yes, dreams do come true

I never thought they did  
But you're living proof

My train of thought was broken by a sudden burst of laughter  
Something badly needed to brighten up the chores  
Seemed old Mrs. Bailey had accidentally fell  
In the water being used to scrub the floors  
Now Mrs. Bailey was the meanest matron at the home  
She believed in lots of work with little play  
And we laughed till we bent double  
Though we knew we'd get in trouble  
But trouble's all we had at evening shade  
Now evening shade was where they claim to teach you understanding  
To teach you love and keep you off the streets  
And all the kids that live here are said to be a problem  
Juvenile delinquents so to speak  
But understanding isn't learned from punishment and anger  
An iron has no gentle touch and love ain't learned from hate  
The reason we were here is 'cause we had no one who cared  
But they cared even less at evening shade  
Little Susan Bradley, one night had wet her bed  
Mrs. Bailey took the razor strap and beat her half to death  
And I knew that something must be done to put an end to this  
And so I started talking plans with the older kids  
Plans were that Joe Johnson would steal the kerosene  
And I would get some matches when nobody seen  
Beckie Adams would make sure the kids were all outside  
Billy Watson would look out for the evil eye  
Now Mrs. Bailey took a nap at three o'clock each day  
We knew that she'd be a'sleeping as the plans got underway  
Now that its all over and the sun is going down  
There's no evening shade 'cause we burned it to the ground

And how long I've felt so low  
If you knew how I wanted someone to come along

And I can almost see through the dark there's light  
If you knew how much this moment means to me  
And how long I've waited for your touch  
If you know how happy you are making me  
I've never thought I'd love anyone so much

"Today as I was walking  
In the fields just down the way  
I sat down on a fallen log  
To pass the time away  
And as I looked around me  
The more that I did look  
The more I realize that I am viewing  
God's coloring book  
I saw a golden ray of sunlight  
A silver drop of dew  
A soft, white floating cloud  
Sailing cross the sky 'a blue  
A yellow dandelion  
Pretty evergreen  
And some red and orange flowers  
Growing wild along the stream  
And the more I look around me  
And the more that I do look  
The more I realize that I am viewing  
God's coloring book  
The greyness in an old man's hair  
The pink in baby's cheeks  
The blackness in a stormy sky  
The brown in fallen leaves  
And the multicolored rainbow  
Stretched out across the sky  
And the purple haze at sunset  
Just before the night  
And the more I look around me  
And the more that I do look  
The more I realize that I am viewing  
God's coloring book  
Then I turn my face toward the sky  
And say a silent prayer  
Though God doesn't speak to me  
I see him everywhere  
He is all around me  
He's everywhere I look  
And each new day is but a new page  
In god's coloring book

"(Dolly Parton)  
I flew off to the wild blue yonder  
'Cause I had a dream  
And I had to go  
But I'm filled with a sense of wonder  
From the love I shared  
With a green-eyed boy  
Lips as sweet as mountain honey  
A body warm as home made wine  
But he had no dreams  
And no means for money  
But he had me just anytime  
Take me back, If just in memory  
Fill my cup again with joy  
The fire still burns in the old rock chimney  
And I still burn for that green-eyed boy  
Now he was pretty  
With chiseled features  
Like the movie stars in the magazines  
My first love and the son of a preacher  
I fantasized me was James Dean  
But the world outside kept pulling at me  
Offered me fame, respect, and gold  
Designer clothes and a fancy mansion  
Expensive cars, so I chose those  
Take me back, If just in memory  
Fill my cup again with joy  
The fire still burns in the old rock chimney  
And I still burn for that green-eyed boy  
Take me back, If just in memory  
Fill my cup again with joy  
The fire still burns in the old rock chimney  
And I still burn for that green-eyed boy  
Ooh, ooh, how I love that green-eyed boy  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, and I still miss  
That green-eyed boy  
Do you think about me  
When the nights are long and cold  
Do you ever miss me  
Do you my green-eyed boy

"(Dolly Parton)  
We might have slept in a rail yard or camped by the river bank  
We fed ourselves from the fruit of the land  
And quenched our thirst with rain  
We never did allow no roots to grow beneath our feet  
Life just had no pattern for Gypsy Joe and me  
All we had was each other and the rags upon our back  
The closest thing to a home we new was some abandoned shack  
But we had all we needed and the rest we didn't need  
Life was free and simple for Gypsy Joe and me  
Now Gypsy was my little dog, I found by the road in a ditch  
And so I named him Gypsy, cause that name just seemed to fit  
Oh and Joe he was my man, the flower of my soul  
Thou he never said he loved me, I just always seemed to know  
While standing by the highway, thumbin' for a ride  
The speeding wheels of a passing car, took Gypsy's life  
I lost him where I found him and his loss was misery  
Now there's no more Gypsy, there's just Joe and me  
Well the winter came and the snow did fall  
And the night was cold and still  
And the rags we wore were not enough  
And Joe he caught the chill  
And he told me how he loved me  
And in my arms he went to sleep  
Now there's no more Gypsy, no more Joe, there's just me  
While standin' here on the edge of this bridge  
Lookin' down I see  
The face of Joe and Gypsy, lookin' back at me  
And somewhere in the distance I can hear them callin' me  
Tonight we'll be together again  
Gypsy, Joe and me

"The gates and doors were barred  
And all the windows fastened down  
I spent the night in sleeplessness  
And rose at every sound  
Half in hope of sorrow  
And half in fear the day  
Would find the soldiers breakin' through  
To drag us all away  
And just before the sunrise  
I heard something at the wall  
The gate began to rattle  
And a voice began to call  
I hurried to the window  
Looked down into the street  
Expecting swords and torches  
And the sound of soldiers' feet  
  
But there was no one there but Mary  
So I went down to let her in  
John stood there beside me  
As she told me where she'd been  
She said they've moved Him in the night  
And none of us know where  
The stone's been rolled away  
And now His body isn't there  
  
We both ran towards the garden  
Then John ran on ahead  
We found the stone and empty tomb  
Just the way that Mary said  
But the winding sheet they wrapped Him in  
Was just an empty shell  
And how or where they'd taken Him  
Was more than I could tell  
  
Oh something strange had happened there  
Just what I did not know  
John believed a miracle  
But I just turned to go  
Circumstance and speculation  
Couldn't lift me very high  
'Cause I'd seen them crucify Him  
Then I saw Him die  
  
Back inside the house again  
The guilt and anguish came  
Everything I'd promised Him  
Just added to my shame  
When at last it came to choices  
I denied I knew His name  
And even if He was alive  
It wouldn't be the same  
  
But suddenly the air was filled  
With a strange and sweet perfume  
Light that came from everywhere  
Drove shadows from the room  
And Jesus stood before me  
With His arms held open wide  
And I fell down on my knees  
And I just clung to Him and cried  
  
Then He raised me to my feet  
And as I looked into His eyes  
The love was shining out from Him  
Like sunlight from the skies  
Guilt in my confusion  
Disappeared in sweet release  
And every fear I ever had  
Just melted into peace  
  
He's alive yes He's alive  
Yes He's alive and I'm forgiven  
Heaven's gates are open wide  
He's alive yes He's alive  
Oh He's alive and I'm forgiven  
Heaven's gates are open wide  
He's alive He's alive  
Hallelujah He's alive  
He's alive and I'm forgiven  
Heaven's gates are open wide  
He's alive He's alive He's alive  
I believe it He's alive

With only tears to show for all the years that we've been fakin'  
God only knows how long, how hard we've tried  
  
Oh, why do we keep holding on  
With nothing left to hold onto  
Let's be honest with each other  
That's the least that we can do  
I feel guilty when they envy me and you  
We're holding on with nothing left to hold onto  
  
We're holding on with nothing left to hold onto

Mother's hold on to your sons and you daughters

Hollywood, Hollywood Terrace of Trauma  
Palace of promises, dealer in dreams  
Some, they go hungry and some go insane  
Some go to the bottle and some to the vains  
Some become users and some become used  
And some even make it, but most never do

All of your glitter and all of your gold  
Is that what you give in exchange for a soul  
Cause they sell their soles for the likes of you  
While you chew up and spit out what you cannot use

There's a room in my heart for you  
  
We'll paint the walls from blue to white  
And set the mood by candlelight  
Together we'll keep out the cold  
And I'll still be there when we're old  
If you'll let me  
  
So there's a room in my heart for you  
If your trust has been stolen too  
If you walk softly on this worn out wooden floor  
And leave behind you the hurt you've had before  
There's a room in my heart for you

"It beats like a drum down in New Orleans  
Sings like a Motown melody  
It dreams like California  
Bigger than a Texas sky  
It bleeds, it scorns, but it shines when times get hard  
You can't break an American heart  
  
She's up before the sun, on the run  
Another dollar another day another cup of coffee  
Thank you Lord  
For giving me one more  
She still leans on her dreams but it seems  
Sometimes she's the only one who still believes that life is hard  
So she takes it on with an American heart

It's something in your touch  
And just around the eyes

I rarely think about him at all  
So when I look at you  
Tell me, what should I do  
With the little bit of him that I saw  
  
Only when you smiled  
You could have bowled me over  
A memory out of nowhere  
That came and went so fast  
  
Don't tell me I still love him  
That has to be a lie  
It's just something in your touch  
And only when you smile

Saved all our wages  
Put ten percent down

Still as glass  
While my baby lay sleeping, an angel slipped past  
And with one breath said I'm taking him back  
To his Father in Heaven  
  
Through gravel and ice and new fallen snow  
I held him through my tears  
Because I was his lonesome prairie

You'll always be a fire I can't put out.

"It all started back in 1981.  
Our life together had just begun.  
I didn't know what my future would hold,  
But you gave me a chance,  
So I set out on the road.  
  
It wasn't easy going then.  
There were times I almost threw that old towel in,

There's still things that I want to say and do.  
I hope you won't forget me, 'cause we've shared a lot dreams.  
And just know that I'll always remember you.  
  
When I first set out on the road, I figured  
I had maybe five good years to sing my songs for you folks.  
Well, it's goin' on thirty now  
And I still love it just as much as I ever did.  
When I hear that announcer say my name,  
And I walk through those curtains  
And see your smilin' faces,  
My feet don't touch the ground again  
Til I walk out and get back on that bus that got me here.  
I don't know how many more years I've got left to do this,  
But I figure a few.  
I do want you to know, though,  
That when I do walk off this stage for the last time,  
And I'm all settled in, away from all this,  
You won't be far away.  
I'll still hear your screams and cheers in my mind.  
And I'll always remember you.  
  
I'm not sayin' I'm through by any means.

A secret that my daddy said was just between us.  
He said, daddies don't just love their children every now and then.  
It's a love without end, amen, it's a love without end, amen.

There was no doubt that stubborn boy was just like my father's son.

I took my daddy's secret and I passed it on to him.

A pink dress, a matching bow, and her ponytail  
She kissed me on the school bus but told me not to tell

Cross the monkey bars to the merry-go-round  
And Emmylou got caught passing me a note

Still like two kids with stars in our eyes  
Not much has changed I still chase Emmylou  
Up and down the hall around the bed in our room  
Last night I took her out in a white limousine  
Twenty years together she still gets to me  
Can't believe it's been that long ago  
When we got started with just a little note

"I just walked down the street to the coffee shop  
Had to take a break  
I'd been by her side for eighteen hours straight  
I saw a flower growing in the middle of the sidewalk  
Pushing up through the concrete  
Like it was planted right there for me to see  
The flashin' lights, the honkin' horns  
All seemed to fade away  
In the shadow of that hospital at 5:08  
I saw God today

I've been to church  
I've read the book  
I know He's here, but I don't look  
Near as often as I should  
Yeah, I know I should  
His fingerprints are everywhere  
I'd just slow down to stop and stare  
Opened my eyes and man I swear  
I saw God today  
  
I saw a couple walking by they were holding hands  
Man, she had that glow  
Yeah I couldn't help but notice she was starting to show  
It stood there for a minute takin' the sky  
Lost in that sunset  
A splash of amber melted in the shades of red  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I got my face pressed up against the nursery glass  
She's sleeping like a rock  
My name on her wrist wearing tiny pink socks  
She's got my nose, she's got her mama's eyes  
My brand new baby girl  
She's a miracle  
I saw God today

It was a mighty big step when I started steppin' out of line  
Though she's still lovin' me, it's not the way it used to be  
That first step did something to her mind  
  
I watched her slip away a little more every day

She's growing colder since the day I told her

They got away with murder down on music row.

Slowly killed tradition and for that someone should hang

That murder was committed down on music row.

Old Hank wouldn't have a chance on today's radio

They said no one would buy them old drinking and cheating songs (I'll still

Murder's been committed down on music row.

And for my woman's love, for my woman's love  
Each day I thank the Lord above for my sweet woman's love  
Through the years of moving town to town  
Still searching for a dream somehow we never found  
And wondering if we would ever settle down  
Her love never died  
And if I have many things today  
I owe it to the love I had along the way  
No matter what went wrong, no matter come what may  
She stood by my side  
And for my woman's love, for my woman's love

I ran away for the first time when I was four years old  
I'm a freeborn man my home is on my back  
I know every inch of highway every foot of backroad every mile of rairoad

I got a gal Cincinnati I got a woman in San Antone  
I've always loved the girl next door but any place is home  
I'm a freeborn man...  
Got me a worn out guitar I carry in an old coal sack  
I've hocked it bout two hundred times but I always get it back

"Friends are never earned they're a gift from the loving God  
And they're precious beyond human evaluation  
But you dare not take them for granted or they'll lift away like a smoke  
And the warmth of their caring will vanish into the chill of the endless
nights  
Most of my friends are unknowns they probably won't even rate an obituary  
Unless they live and die in a small town  
Somewhere where nothing much ever happens  
But a few of my friends are big people  
They'd made the word ring with laughter down to this string of court  
They're famous sensitive talented and their names are household words  
And yet they're no more precious in God's eyes or in mine  
Than those wonderful nobody's who live and die in small towns  
Who is your friend he's someone who warms you with a nod  
Or with an unspoken word in hard times when you're hurting beyond words  
Who is your friend he's someone who holds you to her breast  
And sighs softly into your hair when no other medicine could possibly stop the
pain  
A friend is someone who clings his glass against yours  
Or answers the phone at three in the morning when you're lost  
And with a few words of encouragement and concern  
Makes you realize that you're not really lost at all  
Friends come in both sexes in all shapes and sizes  
The most important thing they have in common is their ability  
To share with you your most sky splitting joys  
Or your deepest most spelling ol' some sorrows for they're all your friends

By forgotten words and bonds  
And the ink stains that have dried upon some line  
That keeps you in the back roads  
By the rivers of my memory  
That keeps you ever gentle on my mind  
  
It's not clingin' to the rocks and ivy  
Planted on their columns now that bind me  
Or something that somebody said because  
They thought we fit together walkin'  
It's just knowing that the world  
Will not be cursing or forgiving  
When I walk along some railroad track and find  
That you're movin' on the back roads

And for hours you're just gentle on my mind  
  
Though the wheat fields and the clothes lines  
And the junkyards and the highways come between us  
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother  
'Cause she turned and I was gone  
I still might run in silence  
Tears of joy might stain my face  
And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind  
But not to where I cannot see  
You walkin' on the back roads  
By the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind  
  
I dip my cup of soup back from a gurglin' cracklin' cauldron  
In some train yard  
My beard a roughening coal pile  
And a dirty hat pulled low across my face  
Through cupped hands 'round a tin can

Ever smilin', ever gentle on my mind

Today is mine...

The pavement hot and cold below looks back at me and seems to know  
It ends without a tear without a smile.

And you can find beauty in the flowers  
And the birds and the bees.

The kind that comes from way inside  
The kind that comforts so.

"A laughing baby boy one evening in his play  
Disturbed the household with his noisy glee  
I warned him to be quiet but he soon would disobey  
For he would soon forget a word from me  
  
I called him to my side and said, ""now son you go to bed  
Your conduct has been very, very rude""  
With quivering lips and tear filled eyes he pleaded then with me  
""Don't make me go to bed papa and I'll be good.""  
  
Don't papa and I'll be good  
Don't papa and I'll be good""

Our lives have just been gladdened by his bright ascending beam  
Our boy now in our hearts was very dear  
We hastened to his bed one night he was talking in his sleep  
He didn't seem to know that we were near.  
  
I took him in my arms and found his body ""raked"" with pain  
To ease the pain we did the best we could  
It broke my heart to hear him cryin' loudly in his sleep  
""Don't make me go to bed papa and I'll be good.""  
  
All night and day we watched and prayed, we never left his side  
To give him up it seemed we never could  
It broke my heart to hear him crying just before he died

"Out in the west Texas town of El Paso I fell in love with a Mexican girl  
Nighttime would find me in Rosa's Cantina music would play and Feleena would
whirl  
Blacker than night were the eyes of Feleena wicked and evil while casting a
spell  
My love was deep for this Mexican maiden I was in love but in vain I could
tell  
  
One night a wild young cowboy came in wild as the west Texas wind  
Dashing and daring a drink he was sharing with wicked Feleena the girl that I
loved  
So in danger I challenged his right for the love of this maiden  
Down went his hand for the gun that he wore  
  
My challenge was answered in less than a heartbeat  
The handsome young stranger lay dead on the floor  
Just for a moment I stood there in silence shocked by the foul deed I had done  
Many thoughts raced through my mind as I stood there  
  
I had but one chance and that was to run  
Out to the backdoor of Rosa's I ran out where the horses were tied  
I caught a good one it looked like it could run up on its back and away I did
ride  
Just as fast as I could from the west Texas town of El Paso  
  
Out to the badlands of New Mexico  
Back in El Paso my life would be worthless everything's gone in life nothing
is left  
It's been so long since I've seen the young maiden  
My love is stronger than my fear of death  
  
I saddled up and away I did go riding alone in the dark  
Maybe tomorrow a bullet would find me  
Tonight nothing's worse than this pain in my heart  
And at last here I am on the hill overlooking El Paso I can see Rosa's Cantina
below  
  
My love is strong and it pushes me onward down off the hill to Feleena I go  
Off to my right I see five mounted cowboys off to my left ride a dozen or more  
Shouting and shooting I can't let them catch me  
I have to make it to Rosa's backdoor  
  
Something is dreadfuly wrong for I feel a deep burning pain in my side  
Though I am trying to stay in the saddle I'm getting weary unable to ride  
But my love for Feleena is strong and I rise where I've fallen  
Though I am weary I can's stop to rest  
  
I see the white puff of smoke from the rifle I feel the bullet go deep in my
chest  
From out of nowhere Feleena has found me kissing my cheeks as she kneels by my
side  
Cradled by two loving arms that I'll die for one little kiss then Feleena
goodbye

While a tear he shed to his wife he said just have two lanterns trimmed  
Just hang a light as I pass tonight hang it where it can be seen  
If our baby's dead just show the red if she's better then show the green  
  
In a little house by the railroad track a mother with watchful eye  
Saw a gleam of hope and a feeble smile as the train went rushing by  
Just one short look was his only chance to see the light agleam  
In the midnight air there arose a prayer thank God the light was green

"Riding on an East-bound freight train, speeding through the night  
Hobo Bill, a railroad bum, was fighting for his life...  
The sadness of his eyes revealed the torture of his soul  
He raised a weak and weary hand to brush away the cold.  
  
Ho-ho-o Bo-o-o Bil-lie!  
  
No warm lights flickered around him, no blankets there to fold  
Nothing but, the howling wind and the driving rain, so cold  
When he heard a whistle blowing, in a dreamy kind of way  
The hobo seemed contented for he smiled there where he lay.  
  
Ho-ho-o Bo-o-o Bil-lie!  
  
Outside the rain was fallin' on that lonesome boxcar door  
But the little form of Hobo Bill lay still upon the floor  
As the train sped through the darkness and the raging storm outside  
No one knew that Hobo Bill was taking his last ride.  
  
It was early in the mornin' when they raised the hobo's head  
The smile still lingered on his face, but Hobo Bill was dead  
There was no mother's longin', to soothe his weary soul  
For he was just a railroad bum, who died out in the cold.

"Tonight as I lay on a boxcar just waiting for a train to pass by  
What will become of the hobo whenever his time comes to die  
Has the Master up yonder in heaven got a place that we might call our home

Will there be any freight trains in heaven any boxcars in which we might hide

Will they hand respect for a hobo in that land that lies hidden up there

T'was a night in June by the western moon

When she smiled my heart did bubble

Her heart was as pure as pretty yellow gold  
But love meant nothin', she was too cold  
But boy, oh boy, oh boy how she could yodel  
  
Well, I said to myself, you silly little elf

She called me names made me feel so ashamed  
Then she said my fire is nobel  
Then she turned me down, didn't want me around

She yodeled a yodel as sweet as it could be  
Her heart was as pure as pretty yellow gold  
But love meant nothin', she was too cold  
But boy, oh boy, oh boy how she could yodel  
  
Next night on thr trail I heard a big wail  
She changed her mind, felt sorry  
Her yodel, you see, was meant for me  
And she said, you had me worried  
I've rode out tonight to make things right  
And I hope you will forgive me  
When I said, why yes, she took a deep breath

Her heart was as pure as pretty yellow gold  
And it turned to warm from icy cold  
But boy, oh boy, oh boy how she did yodel

We're as happy as the birds in the treeses

You either take me like I am or I'll go on alone  
  
So either say you want my love or take the way you live  
Remember though before you get you got to learn to give  
So if it change my life or go then go it's goin' be

"In the days of Noah before the Lord,  
When the wicked had all forgotten God  
Brother Noah, built a boat, which above  
God's wrath did float  
  
And the people saw that they were made of mud  
As the doors swang open and gang plank standing out.  
Noah and his family entered with a shout.  
As the scorners stretched their necks,  
  
Noah stepped out on the deck  
Saying, I'm so glad I'm on the inside looking out.  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh I'd rather be on the inside looking out  
Than to be on the outside looking in  
When the rain began to fall, sinners on the  
Lord did call  
The door was shut and night was setting in.  
Then old Noah from the window looking out  
Gazed to heaven beyond the water spout.  
And he said I thank the Lord that I took Him  
at His word.  
I'm so glad I'm on the inside looking out.  
  
Good old Daniel lived in Babylon long ago  
And he had the grace to tell the devil no.  
Though he prayed three times a day in the  
Good old fashioned way.  
  
They said he, to the lions den must go.  
And lions made him welcomed to their home  
For they knew he was nothing but backbone  
When the king looked in and said, ""Are you  
  
Alive or are you dead?""  
He was stirred as Daniel spoke in gentle tones.

I come into town with some turnips and my little Gabe came along  
No four year old in this country could beat him for purty and strong

I went in for a jug of molasses and I left the team at the door  
But they scared at somethin' and started and I heard one little squeal  
And lickety split over the prairie went team Little Britches and all.  
  
Yes lickety split over the prairie I was almost froze with skeer  
But we rousted up some torches and we searched from far and near  
At last we struck hosses and wagon snowed under a soft white mound  
Upsot dead beat but of little Gabe no hide nor hair could be found.  
  
And here all hope soured on me of findin' my little Gabe  
So I just flopped down on my marrow bones  
And crotched deep in the snow and prayed  
By this time the torches was played out and me and Israel Par  
Went off with some wood to a sheep fold that he said was somewhere thar.  
  
We found it at last in a little she'd where they shut up the lambs at night  
We looked in and seen them huddled there so warm and sleepy and white

I wants a chaw of tobaccy and that's what's the matter of me.  
  
How did he get there angels he could never have walked in that storm

The cow's gone dry and them hens won't lay  
But we're still a-livin', so everything's okay  
  
The hogs took the cholera and they've all done died  
The bees got mad and they left the hive  
The weevils got the corn and the rain rotted the hay  
But we're still a-livin', so everything's okay  
  
The porch rotted down that's more expense  
The darned old mule he tore down the fence  
The mortgage is due and I can't pay  
But we're still a-livin', so everything's okay  
  
The cow broke in the field and eat up the beans  
The darn rabbits they got the turnip greens  
And my ma-in-law just moved in to stay  
But we're still a-livin', so everything's okay  
  
My land's so poor so hard and yeller  
You have to set on a sack of fertilizer to raise an umbreller  
And it rains out here nearly every day  
But we're still a-livin', so everything's okay  
  
The wells gone dry and I have to tote the water  
Up from the spring about a mile and a quarter  
My helper, he quit for the lack of pay  
But we're still a-livin', so everything's okay  
  
The house it leaks it needs a new top  
When it rains it wets everything we got  
The chimney fell down just yesterday  
But we're still a-livin', so everything's okay  
  
The corn meals gone and the meat's run out  
Got nothin' to kill to put in the smokehouse  
The preacher's comin' Sunday to spend the day  
But we're still a-livin', so everything's okay  
  
The canned stuffs spoiled else the jar's got broke  
And all we got left is one old Billy goat  
We're gonna have a new baby about the first of may  
But we're still a-livin', so everything's okay  
  
My crop it rotted in the ground  
I asked for another loan but the banker turned me down  
But we're still a-livin' and we're prayin' for better days

Go get you some treatments just like I've had

I've really learned the meaning of living and loving  
Cause I've been down that road before  
  
Now the man that walks this rocky road  
Usually gets just what he deserves  
  
But he's just a helpless servant to  
A master that he servers  
Now I've learned to slow my temper down  
And not to pick no scraps no more  
  
Boys its a lot easier on the head and the eyes

With shoulders stooped and heads bowed low and eyes that stare in defeat.

You have no right to be the judge, to criticize and condemn.  
Just think but for the grace of God it would be you instead of him.  
One careless step, a thoughtless deed and then the misery starts  
And to those who weep death comes cheap, these men with broken hearts.  
  
Humble you should be when they come passing by,  
For it's written that the greatest of men never get to big to cry.  
Some lose faith in love and life when sorrow shoots her darts,  
With hope all gone, they walk alone these men with broken hearts.  
You've never walked in that man's shoes or saw things through his eyes,  
Or stood and watched with helpless hands while the heart inside you dies.  
  
Some were paupers, some were kings, some were masters of the arts,  
But in their shame they're all the same, these men with broken hearts.  
Life sometimes can be so cruel that a heart will pray for death.  
God why must these living dead know pain with every breath?  
So help your brother along the road, no matter where he starts!  
For the God that made you, made them too. These men with broken hearts!

Of high priest that day  
30 pieces of silver  
Was the price they would pay  
30 pieces of silver  
30 shackles of shame

Unloved and unclaimed  
In anger they pierced him  
But he died not in vein  
Twas on there on the hillside  
The multitude came  
And found our dear savoir  
Then took him away  
They bruised and mocked him  
Thorns was crowned around his head  
And his garment of purple  
Showed the blood stains of red  
Far off in the mountains with his face towards the sun  
Judas begged merci for what he had done  
He gave back the silver  
For his heart filled with strife  
Then there in the mountain he took his own life

30 shackles of shame

"In the world's mighty gallery of pictures  
Hang the scenes that're painted from life  
There's pictures of love and of passion  
And there's pictures of keys and of strife  
  
There hung pictures of youth and of beauty  
Of old age and a blushing young bride

A life has gone out with the tide

There's a poor old mother at home  
She's watching and waiting alone  
Just longing to hear from a loved one so dear  
Just a picture from life's other side  
  
The first scene is that of a gambler  
Who had lost all of his money at play  
And he drowses dead mother's ring from his finger  
Which she wore long ago on her wedding day  
  
It's his last earthly treasure but he stakes it  
Then bows his head that his shame he might hide  
But when they lifted his head they found he was dead  
That's just a picture from life's other side  
  
Now the last scene is that by the river  
Of a heartbroken mother and baby  
As the harbor lights shine and they shiver  
On an outcast, soon no one will save  
  
And yet she was once a true woman  
She was somebody's darling and pride  
God help her she leaps, oh there's no one to weep  
It's just a picture from life's other side

"I've just been to heaven with someone so true  
I dreamed about mama last night  
She read me the Bible like she used to do  
I dreamed about mama last night  
  
She never close her eyes and sleep till we were all in bed  
And on party nights till we came home she often sat and read  
We little thought about it then for we were young and gay  
Just how much mama worried when we children were away  
  
We only knew she never slept when we were out at night  
That she waited just to know that we'd all come home alright  
Why sometimes when we'd stay away till one or two or three  
It seemed to us that mama heard the turnin' of the key  
  
For always when we'd step aside she'd call and we'd reply  
But we were all too young back then to understand the reason why  
Until the last one had returned she'd always keep a light  
For mama couldn't sleep until she kissed us all goodnight  
  
She had to know that we were safe before she went to rest  
Well she seemed to fear that the world might harm  
The ones that she loved the best  
And once she told me when you're grown to women and to men  
Perhaps I'll sleep the whole night through I may be different then  
  
And so it seemed that night and day we knew a mother's care  
That always when we got back home we'd find her waitin' there  
Then came the night that we were called together round her bed  
The children are all with you now the kindly doctor said  
  
And in her eyes the gleam again that old time tender light  
That told that she's just been waitin' to know we were alright  
She smiled that old familiar smile and prayed to God to keep  
Her children safe from harm throughout the years  
And then she went to sleep  
  
My dream is a treasure that I'll always keep  
I dreamed about mama last night

"LITTLE BOSEPHUS  
WRITER HANK WILLIAMS  
Little Bosephus, you're the one, makes me feel good inside  
Just to know that you're my son makes my heart swell with pride  
I've always needed one like you to love and understand  
Now that you've come to fill that place, you're my buddy, man to man  
There comes a time when every boy grows so cocksure with life  
So that he feels he knows it all and no longer needs advice  
The complicated phase of life is called ""adolescent age""  
And sometimes breaks a father's heart---wish you could skip that stage  
I'd like to help you fill your heart with kindness, faith and truth  
Protect you from the hands that reach out to destroy manhood and you  
There is so much sorrow and despair to blight the hearts of men  
And the more we learn of love and life, the more they come crowding in  
It's just little things at first, my son, then, as we grow older  
Our troubles grow much bigger too and sometimes, they overflow  
The poisoned minds and broken hearts will cause strongest men to weep  
Overwhelm souls with bitterness and death would be so sweet  
So we must build a strong defense of love and fortitude  
On character and knowledge, son, so these ills cannot intrude  
Ah, Sonny boy, so many things a youngster needs to know  
If he is to find true happiness as down through this life he goes  
It's just a father's love, I guess, that comes to every Dad  
That makes me want to shelter you from things that make you sad  
Bosephis, boy, I'm standing by to help you when you call  
For Son, you are my flesh and blood and the grandest pal of all

"I was walking in Savannah past a church, decayed and dim  
When slowly through the window came a plaintive funeral hymn  
My sympathy awakened and a wonder quickly grew  
'Til I found myself environed in a little colored pew  
Out front a colored couple sat in sorrow nearly wild  
On the altar was a casket and in the casket was a child  
I could picture him while living, curly hair protruding lips  
I'd seen perhaps a thousand in my hurried southern trips  
Then rose a sad, old colored preacher from his little wooden desk  
With a manner sort of awkward and countenance grotesque  
The simplicity and shrewdness in his Ethiopian face  
Showed the wisdom and the ignorance of a crushed, undying race  
And he said, ""Now don't be weepin' for this pretty bit of clay  
For the little boy who lived there has done gone and run away  
He was doing very finely and he 'ppreciates your love  
But his sho nough father wanted him in the big house up above  
The Lord didn't give you that baby, by no hundred thousand miles  
He just think you need some sunshine and he lent it for a while  
And he let you keep and love him 'til your hearts were bigger grown  
And these silver tears you're shedding now, are just interest on the loan  
Just think my poor dear mourners creeping long on sorrow?s way  
What a blessed picnic this here baby got today  
Your good fathers and good mothers crowd the little fella round  
In the angels 'tender garden of the big plantation ground  
And his eyes they brightly sparkle at the pretty things he view  
But a tear came and he whispered, ""I want my parents too""  
Then the angel's chief musicians teach that little boy a song  
Says if only they be faithful, they'll soon be comin' 'long  
And so my poor dear mourners, let your hearts with Jesus rest  
And don't go to criticizn' the one what knows the best  
He has give us many comforts He's got the right to take away

When the seals are broken and names are read aloud  
You'll see many loved ones standin' in the crowd  
So brother, keep on prayin' and follow where you're lead  
You'll stand in God's Kingdom when the Book Of Life is read

"YOU BROKE YOUR OWN HEART  
WRITERS HANK WILLIAMS, HANK WILLIAMS JR.  
You're letter says you're unhappy we're many miles apart  
It's a little late to ask for pity,  
Remember you broke your own heart  
You walked out on the heart that loved you, has no pity from the start  
You cheated and lied and now you're gonna cry,  
Remember you broke your own heart  
A heart can stand so much sorrow and then it bends and breaks  
And a love that is honest and true can turn to bitter hate  
Now that you're gone and lonely, and your dreams have fallen apart  
Think of the one that once loved you,  
Remember you broke your own heart

What everybody, knew but me  
Just trusting you, was my great sin  
What can I do, you win again.  
  
I'm sorry for, your victim now  
'Cause soon his head, like mine will bow  
He'll give his heart, but all in vain  
And someday say, you win again.  
  
You have no heart, you have no shame  
You take true love, and give the blame  
I guess that I, should not complain  
I love you still, you win again.

This a a little tale about a hotel in the Caribbean.  
Well it wasn't really a hotel, it was a patio  
Bar with funky rooms and an outdoor disco  
With bad wiring. Some people said if you looked  
Between the cracks of the floorboards of our  
Dance floor you would see Hell. If you ever  
Went there, you would know what I'm talking  
About. If you never had, then we  
Thought we'd send you a little musical souvenir.  
  
Some say it was a planet  
Some say it was a rock  
For five wild years in L""Orient  
The party never stopped  
  
There were pirates from the Indies  
There were models from Paris  
There were locals and New Yorkers  
And the Brazilian Navy  
  
By mini-moke and scooters  
In cabs and stolen cars  
Came the creatures of the evening  
From St. Martin and from Mars

By the hot tub near the sea  
  
Every night at midnight  
Seems the devil took control  
And the hill became a parking lot  
Fueled by rock 'n' roll  
  
They were talking by the cannon  
But I couldn't believe my ears  
The Russian had plutonium  
The sailor wanted beers  
  
They shook hands in the moonlight  
And broke out a big cigar  
Just business as usual  
Beneath the tropic stars

Back in the old St. Barts  
  
Then the glitz and all the glamour  
Hit like a hurricane  
Or maybe we just all grew up  
But it never was the same  
  
The gendarmes finally closed the joint  
And the fire it did the rest  
But on New Year's Eve of '91  
We sang the last request

Every flounder, tadpole, and soft shell feels the choreography  
  
Beautiful swimmers they know how to move  
Sneakin' past the draggers and the oyster bars  
Beautiful swimmers just feel the groove  
Painting liquid brush strokes like Renoir  
  
I miss my dorsal fin, I can't explain  
I'm a big fish outta water  
Dwellin' on the coastal plain  
  
Now if I was as rich as the Agacon  
I tell you what I would do  
Buy every man, woman, and child on this planet  
A mask and a snorkel too  
Then I'd leave that wild migration  
Destination Chesapeake Bay  
Then we'd splash our way around the world  
Life is just a water ballet  
  
Come all you beautiful swimmers you know how to move  
Let's crowd across the water like a steel guitar  
Beautiful swimmers stay in the groove  
Catching constant currents near and far

"Once I knew a man, showed me the sleight of hand  
In the blink of an eye he danced across the strings  
He played a song I'd never heard, poignant and absurd  
And to this day it leaves me wondering  
  
Don't let tomorrow find you wishing  
Boy, you got a mission to shake it, rattle and roll  
Oh now, just use your intuition  
You'll get less competition from the clock upon the wall  
  
You are what you are, you dream what you dream  
Play on your blue guitar for me  
Play me a serenade, a simple masquerade  
Play on your blue guitar for me  
  
Was he real or make believe or someone to deceive  
That time is just a folly we can't see  
You only know one song, play it right or wrong  
Cause the truth is always somewhere in between  
  
You and I, we can't change the weather  
And we're all in this together so let the strong wind blow  
Oh now, things will be much better  
If you don't become a prisoner to the reason you should know you know  
  
Are what you are, you dream what you dream  
Play on your blue guitar for me  
Play me a serenade, a lover's masquerade  
Play on your blue guitar for me

Asking them questions of where they have been  
She offered them chocolate she offered them tea  
They all took their seats in the top of a tree  
  
And raccoon brought wine and the mice they brought cheese  
Beautiful birds floated by on the breeze  
From out in the oceans the dolphins began  
Humming a tune that soon covered the land

Gifts to the travelers from some other world  
The Bush doctor mixed up a magical spell  
Swore them to secrecy, never to tell  
  
So young Mr. Moon flew away in the night  
With his best friend Magnus still right by his side  
The sun was just rising, they'd be home by noon

Most every day goes by according to design

We can decorate or climb or find some way to get around  
Cause I'm still on your side  
From the bottom of my heart

Living large was once the deal, now I watch the stars instead  
They are timeless and predictable unlike most things that I do  
But I tell the wind and my old friend I?m headed home to you

Off the coast of Carolina

Religion is in the hands of some crazy-ass people

"In Amerigo, Carnival was as hallowed as Christmas itself, perhaps slightly
more  
So.  
There was a meaning to it. See, Islanders did not put into words, yet which  
Made it the authentic supreme day in the Kinjian calendar.  
  
Africa was marching down the main street of this little harbor town today.  
  
Africa, in undimmed black vitality, surging up out of centuries of island  
Displacement, island slavery, island isolation, island ignorance.  
  
Africa, unquenchable in its burning love of life.  
  
Carnival was Africa Day in Amerigo.

And your life is the story of the wind  
Your life is a story like the wind

Flew on up to Mexico, standin' by the shore.

couldn't help to ease his mind  
Havana daydreamin' oh he's just dreamin' his life away.  
  
Daddy shucked that sugar cane,  
One day he fell dead.  
Jesus had a wanderin' feelin'  
Swimmin around in his head.  
Sailin' on a midnight boat,  
There were no questions asked,

Oh he's just schemin', his life away.

A fragrance on the pillow case

Looking for answers  
To questions that bothered him so  
  
He was impressive  
Young and aggressive  
Savin' the world on his own  
But the warm summer breezes  
The French wines and cheeses  
Put his ambition at bay  
His summers and winters  
Scattered like splinters  
And four to five years slipped away  
  
Then he went to England  
Played the piano  
And married an actress named Kim  
They had a fine life, she was a good wife  
And bore him young son named Jim  
And all of the answers, and all the questions  
He locked in his attic one day  
'Cause he liked the quiet  
Clean country livin' and  
Twenty more years slipped away  
  
Well, the war took his baby  
Bombs killed his lady  
And left him with only one eye  
His body was battered  
His whole world was shattered  
And all he could do was just cry  
While the tears were falling and he was recalling  
Answers he'd never found  
So he hopped on a freighter, skidded the ocean  
And left England without a sound  
  
Now he lives in the islands  
Fishes the pilings  
And drinks his green label each day  
Writing his memoirs  
Losin' his hearin'  
But he don't care what most people say  
Through eighty-six years of perpetual motion  
If he likes you he'll smile, and he'll say,  
""Jimmy, some of it's magic, some of it's tragic  
But I had a good life all of the way.""

It's a job but without it I'd be less  
Than what I expect from me""  
  
I've been lazy most all of my life  
Writing songs and sleeping late  
Any manual labor I've done purely by mistake  
If street sweepers can smile then  
I've got no right to feel upset  
But sometimes I still forget  
Till the lights go on and the stage is set  
And the song hits home and you feel that sweat  
  
It's my job to be different than the rest  
and that's enough reason to go for me  
It's my job to be better than the best  
and that's a tough break for me  
It's my job to be cleaning up this mess  
and that's enough reason to go for me  
  
It's my job to be better than the best

It was a beautiful day, the kind you want to toast  
We were tree top flyin' movin' west along the coast  
Then we landed in the water, just about my favorite thrill  
When some asshole started firing as we taxied to Negril  
  
Just about to lose my temper as I endeavored to explain  
We had only come for chicken we were not a ganja plane  
Well, you should have seen their faces when they finally realized  
We were not some coked up cowboy sporting guns and alibis

They shot from the top of the cliff, they had all gone haywire  
We're catchin' fire, and there wasn't even a spliff

Friends, strangers, they were all apologizin'  
Some thought me crazy foe being way too nice

Seeking transportation to town  
As the purple ink dried on his passport  
He could still feel the eyes look around  
  
""Messieur ou est le casino?""  
He spoke to the cabbie and smiled  
The driver replied ""Vieux ou noveaux?""  
As he motioned the dark man inside.  
  
Business in Aruba concluded  
He now had a little money to spend  
That's how I came to meet my African friend  
  
We were rollin' the bones several hours  
Conversing as most gamblers do  
We were calling on all of our powers  
Hoping to see the night through.  
  
But not approving at all of our winning  
The pit boss he tugged at his sleeve  
Through the whole thing my new friend was grinning  
When he motioned it's time we should leave.  
  
With our night at the tables behind us  
We were ready just to do it again  
That's when I came to know my African Friend  
  
But I woke up on the steps of a whorehouse  
Soldier told me I' better leave  
As I stumbled to find me a taxi  
I saw a note pinned to my sleeve.  
  
""It was a pleasure and a hell of an evening  
Truly was our night to win  
But the authorities insist on my leaving  
Take care, my American friend.""  
  
With my weekend at Haiti concluded  
I now had a little money to spend  
That's when I came to meet my African friend  
That's how I came to know another good friend.

"See the lady  
Smiles as if to tell  
Her son remembers everyone  
Treats 'em all quite well  
He never asked for promises  
And now his fame is wide  
And everyone who knew him well shares a little pride  
  
[Chorus:]  
Ain't he a genius?  
The boy's become a star  
And he smiles upon the faces  
Who wish they could go far  
  
Not long ago they criticized  
The genius only wrote  
And now they listen spellbound  
With lumps caught in their throats  
  
His virtue was sheer poverty  
His vice was reading plays  
While other children starved and fought  
He learned just what to say  
Through tension and confession  
He beat the monster down  
Then surfaced in society no longer underground  
  
[Chorus]  
Now they remember  
Talk only of his good  
While jealousy flows in their veins  
And says I wish I could  
  
Ain't he a genius?

"The hills are full of secrets  
Owls watch by night  
Down in town the bars are full  
And the drunks are picking fights  
These are things I know  
But the facts are filtered through  
All the ways I want you  
All the ways I want you  
  
2:19 freight train  
Moaning somewhere near  
I see you in the distance  
But I can't get there from here  
Hard to believe its happening  
But my whole world's shrunken to  
All the ways I want you  
All the ways I want you  
  
Stars look down and laugh at me  
I ought to take a bow  
Don't have to tell them life's hard sometimes  
There's one falling now  
Nobody's here beside me  
I can talk about it to  
All the ways I want you  
All the ways I want you

"Oh no, he's buying an island  
Oh no, he's building a boat  
Why does he never stop smiling?  
Fun surrounds him like a deep moat  
  
Where does he get all those stories?  
How can he tell such a lie?  
He's bound to see purgatory  
His views are in short supply  
  
But Peter Pan would understand  
His schemes and dreams and ploys  
Best keep an eye on his slight hand  
He such an altered boy  
  
Good God, he's talking with parrots  
Painting his dreams in the sand  
Piling up beaucoup demerits  
Doing it just 'cause he can  
  
By Jove he's having a cocoa  
Evading those judgmental eyes  
Calmly walking his tight rope  
High above all the outcries  
  
But Peter Pan would understand  
His schemes and dreams and ploys  
Best keep an eye on his slight hand  
He such an altered boy  
  
The story goes  
he stumbled at the alter  
Now it seems he just blasphemes  
And dwells with dangers daughter  
  
Someone call the talking doctor  
Somebody get a SWAT team  
There he sits getting away with  
murder  
How dare him live out his dreams  
  
But Peter Pan would understand  
His schemes and dreams and ploys  
Best keep an eye on his slight hand  
He such an altered boy  
  
Oh no, he's sailing today  
Oh no, beware Paraguay  
Oh no, anchors aweigh

Instead of being my deliverance  
She had a strange resemblance  
To a cat name Frankenstein

I've got some money cause I just got paid  
How I wish I had someone to talk to  
I'm in an awful way  
  
It's hard on a fella  
When he don't know his way around  
If I don't find me a honey  
To help me spend this money  
I'm headin' back to key west town

"Cameron's getting logical,  
A Vulcan in disguise,  
The mysteries of the night are  
Putting sparkle in his eyes.  
He's looking for sound reasoning,  
But the best that I can do,  
Is this transcendental story,  
That I'll pass along to you.  
  
Past the falls they call Victoria,  
Down the river named the Nile,  
Drifts a tiny little handmade boat,  
It's shaped just like a smile.  
  
And steered by a magician,  
With the knowledge that he needs,  
To keep him on his destined course,  
Past the crocodiles and reeds.  
  
He's the Admiral of the ocean,  
The Lone Eagle in the sky,  
He gave me my first sextant,  
And he taught me how to fly.  
  
It's been quite a lengthy passage,  
From the dawn of time till now,  
He has weathered the infernal storms  
In his trusty petite dow.  
  
He has soared about colossal waves,  
Sailed the endless sea.  
Sometimes he resembles you,  
Sometimes he looks like me.  
  
I saw him through my telescope,  
On a cloudless night in June,  
As he rested between voyages  
At his beach house on the moon.  
  
There are windows to the galaxies  
And hallways to the past.  
There are trapdoors to the future  
And a splintered ancient mast.  
There are relics from Apollo trips,  
When the earthmen came to play,  
And a hammock from a distant star,  
Out in the Milky Way.  
  
He's the Admiral of the ocean  
The Lone Eagle in the sky.  
He game me my first sextant  
And he taught me how to fly.  
  
I saw him through my telescope  
On a cloudless night in June  
As he rested between voyages  
At his beach house on the moon.  
  
A stripped bass breaks the surface  
As the sunset fades away  
And our journey from the Sea of Storms  
Takes us home beside the bay.  
We go fishing in the ocean  
We go traveling back in time  
Like the song says 'teach your children'  
To go fishing with their minds.  
  
Cameron's contemplating  
I'm not sure just what he thinks  
""Is my dad some kind of lunatic  
With his stories and high hi-jinks"".  
Then he says when I get old and gray  
And feel like I'm marooned,  
He will take me in his rocket ship  
To that beach house on the moon.

"Evil it's been here all along  
Good things they just seem to have come and gone  
In my life I have seen so much go wrong  
And there's only one way left for us to get along  
You got to bend a little one way or the other  
You got to leave your mind open to discover  
Seems I've been fightin' it all along  
You got to bend a little no matter which side you're on  
Or soon you'll be gone  
  
Papers they print it every day  
Housewife wraps the garbage then throws it away  
I don't guess she thinks they have that much to say  
But when the time is right she'll be the lady with so much to pay  
You got to bend a little one way or the other  
You got to leave your mind open to discover  
Seems I've been fightin' it all along  
You got to bend a little no matter which side you're on  
Or soon you'll be gone  
  
History it teaches much too well  
Nations had to rise up before they fell  
And my eyes see the story they're tryin' to tell  
And tonight I think I heard the final toll of the bell  
We better  
  
Bend a little one way or the other  
You got to leave your mind open to discover  
Seems I've been fightin' it all along  
You got to bend a little no matter which side you're on

She sounded like she's someone and never missed a beat.  
By the time the number ended they were dancin' in the street.  
  
They'd died and gone to heaven,  
That lively little crowd,  
Trombones and saxophones  
Sent 'em through the clouds.  
It could have gone all night  
But the party had to stop.  
When they blew the circuit breaker  
In the souvenir shop.

Playing every Sunday at the Orange Grove Stand  
They don't play grunge and they don't play loud  
It's the magic of the music that still draws a crowd.

Where I dive straight down until  
I can not see  
Feel my way through a bevy of solutions  
There I realize the answer lies in me  
  
Gettin' off of this boomerang love

I bought a cheap watch from a crazy man  
Floating down canal  
It doesn't use numbers or moving hands  
It always just says now  
Now you may be thinking that I was had  
But this watch is never wrong  
And If I have trouble the warranty said  
Breathe In, Breathe Out, Move On  
  
And it rained, It was nothing really new  
And it blew, we've seen all that before  
And it poured, the Earth began to strain

It will make you strong

Past is dead and gone  
Don't try to shake it just nod your head

Philosophy is not for me, laughing is my game  
I'm a cultural infidel, slap me with the blame  
  
Loose cannon, Armageddon, preachers at the door  
Spittin' poison at the boys 'n girls on dance floor

Someone's got to raise some hell, it might as well be me  
  
I'm a cultural infidel, believe in common sense  
I'm a cultural infidel, love the present tense  
But we have to keep a look out for those mean old backed-up farts  
I'm a cultural infidel, comin' from the heart  
  
My heart, my heart, mon coeur  
Will I see you in Heaven, will I see you in Hell  
Will I see you in Rio, only time will tell  
  
Will I see you in Heaven, will I see you in Hell  
Will I see you tomorrow, only time will tell

It's the ways of her father  
If she's gonna change she hasn't done it yet  
And the desert is calling to me  
Run before the final trap is set  
All roads lead to the city  
Where the dudes and the dykes all look the same  
Lady lays out the pattern  
With the parts of her body that seem tame  
Death valley lives and tracy isn't sure what really gives  
Act like a child and I'll respond with my well-rehearsed farewell  
Quoting the verse that you bought but weren't quite prepared to sell  
Saying I think I love you  
Maybe I care  
It's not fair  
Death valley lives and tracy isn't sure what really gives  
And it's a sore spot when the room's burning hot  
And the desert air just cannot bring you down  
Still the bed's warm but a cold arm  
Keeps me floating inches off the ground  
Death valley lives and tracy isn't sure what really gives  
Go paint your toes wipe you nose and then come to say goodbye  
And all along tell yourself I am wrong if I try  
Crying sorry it's over  
I'm not to blame  
What a game  
Death valley lives now I'm not even sure what really gives  
Ho, ha

"I live on a big round ball  
I never do dream I may fall  
And even one day if I do  
Well I'll jump up and smile back at you  
I don't even know where we are  
They tell me were circling a star  
Well I'll take their word, I don't know  
But I'm dizzy so it may be so  
  
I'm riding a big round ball  
I never do dream I may fall  
And even the high must lay low  
But when I do fall I will be glad to go  
Yes when I do fall I will be glad to go

"Ramadan is over,  
The new moon's shown her face,  
I'm halfway round the planet,  
In a most unlikely place.  
  
Following my song line  
Past bamboo shacks and shops  
Behind a jitney packed like sardines,  
With bananas piled on top.  
  
I ran away from politics,  
It's too bizarre at home.  
Away I flew, tuned into Blue  
""Maybe Amsterdam or Rome""  
  
Awakened by a stewardess,  
With Spain somewhere below.  
On the threshold of adventure,  
God I do love this job so.  
  
So while I make my move  
On the big board game  
Up and down a Spanish highway,  
Some things remain the same.  
Girls meet boys  
and the boys tease girls  
I'm heading out this morning,  
For the Far Side of the World.  
  
Oh I believe in song lines  
Obvious and not  
I'd ridden them like camels  
To some most peculiar spots.  
  
They run across the oceans  
Through mountains and saloons  
And tonight out to the dessert  
Where I sit atop this dune.  
  
I was destined for this vantage point  
Which is so far from the Sea  
I've lived it in the pages of Saint-Exupery  
  
From Paris to Tunisia  
Casablanca to Dakar  
I was riding long before I flew  
Through the wind and sand and stars.  
  
Caravan  
Ride that hump  
And Timbuktu's a jillion bumps  
Sleeping bags and battle flags  
Are coiled and furled  
That's the way you travel  
To the far side of the world!  
  
A Sunset framed by lightening bolts  
Burns a lasting memory  
And a string of tiny twinkling lights  
adorn the sausage tree.  
While the embers from the log fire  
Flicker, fly, and twirl  
Then drift off toward the cosmos  
From the Far Side of the World.  
Well it's Christmas and my birthday  
and so to that extent  
The Masai not the wise men  
Are circling my tent.  
I teach them how to play guitar  
They show me how to dance  
We have rum from the Caribbean  
And Burgundy from France.  
  
New Year's Eve in Zanzibar  
With Babu and his boys  
High up on the rooftop  
You can relish all the noise.  
  
They are dancing on the tables  
People bouncing like gazelles  
Two 0-0-1 is ushered in  
With air raid horns and bells.  
  
Time to sing time to dance  
Living out my second chance.  
  
Cobras and sleeping bags are coiled and curled  
That's the way it happens  
On the Far Side of the World.  
  
Back at home, it's afternoon  
Six thousand miles away.  
I will still be there when I get through  
Attending this soiree  
  
There are jobs and chores and questions  
And plates I need to twirl,  
But tonight I'll take my chances,  
On the Far Side of the World.

Fun tickets in my pocket, visions in my brain

Up to the mountain, down to the sea  
Take me to Leblon where the samba queen  
Waits for me

1971  
I have been out wandering  
I have traveled far  
One conclusion I have made  
Is God don't own a car  
He don't wear no fancy clothes  
He'd rather take the bus  
He would pay a tourist fare  
So he could sit with us  
He don't have no tamborine  
Guitar or slide trombone  
The music we make here on earth  
The words they are his own  
And when we finally reach his home  
And walk among the stars  
He'll join our band then we'll understand  
Why God don't own a car  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la

"Well, like to explain to you all before,  
I ain't no drinkin' man  
I tried it once and it got me highly irregular  
And I swore I'd never do it again  
I promised my brother in-law that I'd go up watch his still  
  
While he went in to town to vote  
It was right up on the mountain  
Where the map said it would be  
Friends let me tell you one thing,  
Tho it wasn't no ordinary still  
It stood up on that mountainside  
Like a hugh golden opal  
  
God's yeller moon shinin' on the cool clear evenin'  
God's little lanterns twinklin' on and off in the heavens  
Like I explain'd to you once before I ain't no drinkin' man  
But temptation got the best of me  
And I took a slash  
That yella whiskey runnin' down my throat  
Like honey dew vine water  
And I took another slash,  
Took another'n an another'n an another'n  
For you knew I'd downed one whole jug of that shit  
And commenced to gettin' hot flashes  
  
Goose pimples was runnin' up and down my body  
And a feelin' came over me  
Like somethin' I'd never experienced before  
It was like, like I was in love  
  
In love for the first time, with anything that moved  
Animate, inanimate it didn't matter  
It's like there's a great neon sign flashin' on an' off  
In my brain sayin' ""Jimmy Buffett there's a great day a comin'""  
'Cause I was drunk  
I wasn't knee crawlin', slip slidin', Reggie Youngin'  
Commode huggin' drunk  
I was God's own drunk and a fearless man  
  
And that's when I first saw the bear  
He was a Kodiak lookin' fella 'bout nineteen feet tall  
He rambled up over the hill  
Expectin' me to do one of two things,  
Flip or fly, I didn't do either one  
It hung him up  
  
He started sniffin' around my body tryin' to smell fear  
But he ain't gonna smell no fear 'cause  
I'm God's own drunk and a fearless man  
It hung him up  
  
He looked right in my eyes, and my eyes  
Was a lot redder than his was  
It hung him up  
  
So I approached him, I said ""Mr. Bear, I love  
Every hair on your twenty-seven acre body  
I know you got a lot of friends over there  
On the other side of the hill  
  
There's ole' rare bear, tall bear, Freddy bear, Kelly bear  
Really bear, smelly the bear, smokey the bear,  
Pokey the bear  
  
I want you to go back over there tonight  
And tell them I'm feelin' right  
You tell them I love each and everyone of them  
Like a brother and a sister  
  
But if they give me any trouble tonight  
I'm gonna run every God damn one of them off the hill""  
He took two steps backwards and didn't know what to think  
Neither did I but bein' charitable and cautious  
Well hell I approached him again  
  
I said ""Mr. Bear, You know in the eyes of the Lord  
We're both beasts when it comes right down to it  
So I want you to be my buddy, Buddy bear""  
So I took ole' buddy bear by his island size paw  
And I led him over to the still  
He's a sniffin' around that thing cause  
He's smellin' somethin' good  
I gave him one of them jugs of honey dew vine water  
He downed it up right  
  
Looked like one of them damn bears in the circus  
Sippin' sasparilly in the moonlight  
I gave him another'n an another'n an another'n  
For I knew it he downed eight of them  
And commenced to doin' the bear dance  
Two snips, a snort, a fly turn, and a grunt  
It was so simple like the jitter bug  
It plum evaded me  
  
We worked ourselves into a tumultuous uproar  
And I was awful tired and went over to the hillside  
And I laid down and went to sleep  
Slept for four hours and dreampt me some tremulous dreams  
When I woke up, there was God's yeller moon  
Shinin' on the clear cool evenin'  
God's little lanterns twinklin' on and off  
In the heavens  
  
My buddy the bear was a missin'  
Want to know something else friends and neighbors  
So was that still

With hidden wisdom to impart  
In a world that needs more dancing

Photograph shows, she is lovely  
Her bare feet are a work of art  
Her fragrance speaks of Frangipanni  
Yes, she's still a hula girl at heart  
  
With her pen and watercolors  
Drawing fish and butterflies  
Children always seem to conjure  
Images they recognize  
  
In the land beside the ocean  
Where romantics seem to dwell  
Destiny can set in motion  
Ripples that turn into swells  
  
She knows how to face the music  
She knows where the magic starts  
In a world that needs more dancing  
She's still a hula girl at heart  
  
Song sing slow  
Days gone by  
Time can't keep her  
Nor can I  
  
She has worn a wealth of costumes  
Hula skirts to wedding gowns  
Lived in cities walked through jungles  
Always sees the sun go down  
  
In this age of teeming tourists  
Fellow travelers know her well  
The darling of deserted beaches  
Adds her rhythms in a shell  
  
Her sensual and easy motion  
Seems impossible to chart  
In a world that needs more dancing  
She's still a hula girl at heart

"Jimmy Buffett, Will Jennings, Michael Utley  
There are oceans of feelings between us  
Currents that take us and sweep us away  
That's why we seldom have seen us  
In the light of a cold hard day  
  
Lots of new friends with the same old answers  
Open your eyes, you might see  
Of our lives were that simple  
We'd live in the past  
If the phone doesn't ring, it's me  
  
If the phone doesn't ring  
You'll know that it's me  
I'll be out in the eye of the storm  
If the phone doesn't ring  
You'll know that I'll be  
Where someone can make me feel warm  
It's too bad we can't turn  
And live in the past  
If the phone doesn't ring, it's me  
  
I've had good days and bad days  
And going half mad days  
I try to let go but you're still on my mind  
I've lost all the old ways  
I'm searching for new plays  
Putting it all on the line  
  
Lots of new friends with the same old problems  
Open your eyes, you might see  
If our lives were that simple  
We'd live in the past  
If the phone doesn't ring, it's me  
  
If it takes all the future  
We'll live through the past  
If the phone doesn't ring, it's me

"In the shelter, in the morning as  
The sun was brightly gleaming,  
I heard her crying out,  
""What is it all about? I just don't know,  
But I can't go back home.""  
  
Lonely princess, all the days out  
On your own are growing empty.  
Nothin' is goin' well, if you  
Could only tell them how you feel.  
But they're too real to understand.  
  
Too many trite expressions ending in  
Forced rejection long ago.  
Too many innocent faces in too many  
Far-out places, something's wrong.  
  
Let me tell you that something's wrong.  
It's been that way so long, and it's a shame.  
  
On the street car to the city,  
Where she knows that she may lose it all,  
Riding for just a dime,  
Takin' her own sweet and knowing well  
That this could be her final fall,  
Past the boutique, to the alley,  
Down the river, people pass her by.  
She sits on the big gray rocks,  
Takes off her boots and socks,  
Not knowing what she will do next,  
Just starts to cry.  
  
To many wild rejections ending in  
Angry questions from her dad.  
To many TV dinners, ah, everyone  
Loves a winner, but she was lost.  
No ones knows the trials she had.  
  
In the shelter, in the morning as  
The sun was brightly gleaming,  
I heard her crying out,  
""What is it all about? I just  
Don't know, but I can't go back home.""  
Hell, I just don't know, but  
I can't go back home.

But now I'm incommunicado  
Driving by myself down the road with a hole in it  
Songs with no vibrato

I found myself on the continental divide  
Tell me where do we go from here?  
Think I'll ride into Leadville and have a few beers  
Think of ""Red River"",""Liberty Valence"" can't believe the old man's gone

But now he's incommunicado  
Leaving such a hole in a world that believed  
That a life with such bravado  
Was taking the right way home  
  
So when I finished the last line  
I put the book by itself on the shelf  
With my heart in it  
Never wasting time takin' the right way home  
I know you're never wastin' time  
Findin' the right way home  
  
Still I am incommunicado  
Livin' next door to a leg with a pin in it  
Never wastin' time, takin' the right way home

Rock and roll is not too long  
He said son you got to be commercial  
If you want to turn the people on.

Now that's a beautiful place to be  
But if I spend my time makin' memorable rhyme

Well the people where havin' a good time  
Makin' music all day long

One penny for playin' a song

"If necessity is the mother of invention  
Then I'd like to kill the guy who invented this  
The numbers come together in some kind of a third dimension  
A regular algebraic bliss.  
  
Let's start with something simple, like one and one ain't three  
Any two plus two will never get you five.  
There are fractions in my subtraction and x don't equal y  
But my homework is bound to multiply.

I'd like to burn this textbook, I hate this stuff so much.  
Math suks math suks  
Sometimes I think that I don't know that much  
But math suks.  
  
I got so bored with my homework, I turned on the TV.  
The beauty contest winners were all smiling through their teeth.  
Then they asked the new Miss America  
Hey babe can you add up all those bucks?  
She looked puzzled, then just said  
""Math Suks"".  
  
Math suks math suks  
You don't even have to spell it,  
All you have to do is yell it  
Math suks math suks  
Sometime times I think that I don't know that much  
But math suks.  
  
Geometry, trigonometry and if that don't tax your brain  
There are numbers to big to be named  
Numerical precision is a science with a mission  
And I think it's gonna drive me insane.  
  
Parents fighting with their children, and the Congress can't agree  
Teachers and their students are all jousting constantly.  
Management and labor keep rattling old sabers  
Quacking like those Peabody ducks.

"I went out fishing on a sandy beach  
Cast my line out as far as it would reach  
Looking for something from the frying pan  
I kick back with a beer in my hand  
  
I must've got a big one cause it's bending my pole  
I'm having to fight just to keep my hold  
It could be a whale (oh) God only knows  
Whatever it is it's not wearing any clothes  
  
She's larger than life  
Made from holy water  
She's covered in green  
She's got little scales upon her  
She's larger than life  
She's a mermaid in the night  
  
She's got a set of gills, like no fish I've ever seen  
Long blonde hair and a tail in between  
I'm in love with a creature from the sea  
And she's bringin' out the crustacean in me  
  
Her voice is a temptation it's a siren song  
When we kiss there could be no wrong  
I ask her to marry me, to be my wife  
And we could do the backstroke for the rest of our lives  
  
She's larger than life  
Made from holy water

From a worn-out picture that my mother'd had

He was big and bent and gray and old  
And I looked at him and my blood ran cold  
And I said, ""My name is Sue, how do you do  
Now you're gonna die""

Well, I hit him hard right between the eyes

But I busted a chair right across his teeth  
And we crashed through the wall and into the street  
Kicking and a' gouging in the mud and the blood and the beer  
  
I tell ya, I've fought tougher men  
But I really can't remember when  
He kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile  
I heard him laugh and then I heard him cuss  
He went for his gun and I pulled mine first  
He stood there lookin' at me and I saw him smile  
  
And he said, ""Son, this world is rough  
And if a man's gonna make it, he's gotta be tough  
And I knew I wouldn't be there to help ya along  
So I give ya that name and I said goodbye  
I knew you'd have to get tough or die  
And it's the name that helped to make you strong""

And I know you hate me, and you got the right  
To kill me now, and I wouldn't blame you if you do  
But ya ought to thank me, before I die  
For the gravel in ya guts and the spit in ya eye  
'Cause I'm the son-of-a-bitch that named you Sue""  
  
Well what could I do? What could I do?  
I got all choked up and I threw down my gun  
And I called him my paw, and he called me his son  
And I came away with a different point of view  
And I think about him, now and then  
Every time I try and every time I win  
And if I ever have a son, I think I'm gonna name him..

"I know that hearts were loving  
Long before I was here.  
And I'm not the first to ever cry  
In my bed or in my beer.  
There were songs before there was radio  
Of love that stays  
And love that goes.  
They were writing melancholy tunes  
And tearful words that rhyme.  
  
[Chorus]  
Before my time.  
Before my time.  
  
There were songs in old dusty books  
Of love that's always been.  
Sweet lovers in their glory  
Who are now gone with the wind.  
Old fashioned love words spoken  
Then keep coming back around again  
Nothing's changed except the name,  
Their love burned just like mine.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And in the dim of yesterday  
I can clearly see  
That flesh and blood  
Cried out to someone  
As it does in me.  
And there was some old song that said,  
""I love you til I die.""  
  
[Chorus]  
  
But what the old time master's had  
Is what I feel for you.  
Love is love and doesn't change  
In a century or two.  
If someway they had seen and knew  
How it would be for me and you  
They'd wish for love like yours  
And they would wish for love like mine.

"Big John, big John  
  
Every morning at the mine, you could see him arrive  
He stood 6 foot 6, weighed 245  
Kind of broad at the shoulders, narrow at the hip  
And everybody knew you didn't give no lip to big John  
  
Big John, big John  
Big, bad John  
Big John  
  
Nobody seemed to know where John called home  
He just drifted into town and stayed all alone  
He didn't say much, kind of quiet and shy  
And if you spoke at all, you'd just said hi to big John  
  
Somebody said he came from New Orleans  
Where he got into a fight over a Cajun Queen  
And a crushing blow from a huge right hand  
Sent a Louisiana fella to the promise land  
  
Big John, big John  
Big, bad John  
Big John  
  
Then came the day at the bottom of the mine  
When a timber cracked and men started crying  
Minors were praying, and hearts beat fast  
And everybody thought they had breathed their last 'cept John  
  
Through the dust and the smoke of this man made hell  
Walked a giant of a man that the minors knew well  
Grabbed a sagging timber and gave out with a groan  
And like a giant oak tree he just stood there alone, big John  
  
Big John, big John  
Big, bad John  
Big John  
  
And with all of his strength, he gave a mighty shove  
Then a minor yelled out, ""There's a light up above!""  
And 20 men scrambled from a would be grave  
Now there's only one left down there to save, big John  
  
With jacks and timbers, they started back down  
Then came that rumble way down in the ground  
And as smoke and gas smelched out of that mine  
Everybody knew it was the end of the line for big John  
  
Big John, big John  
Big, bad John  
Big John  
  
Now they never reopened that worthless pit  
They just placed a marble stand in front of it  
These few words are written on that stand  
'At the bottom of this mine, lies one hell of a man, big John'  
  
Big John, big John

"But the land was already claimed by a people  
When the cowboy came and when the soldiers came  
The story of the American Indian is in a lot of ways  
A story of tragedy, like that day at Wounded Knee, South Dakota  
Big Foot was an Indian chief  
Of the Minneconjou band  
A band of Minneconjou Sioux  
From South Dakota land  
Big Foot said to Custer  
""Stay away from Crazy Horse""  
But Custer crossed into Sioux land  
And he never came back across  
Then Big Foot led his people  
To a place called Wounded Knee  
And they found themselves surrounded  
By the 7th Cavalry  
Big chief Big Foot  
Rise up from your bed  
Minneconjou babies cry  
For their mothers lying dead  
Big Foot was down with a fever  
When he reached Wounded Knee  
And his people all were prisoners  
Of the 7th Cavalry  
Two hundred women and children  
And another hundred men  
Raised up a white flag of peace  
But peace did not begin  
An accidental gunshot  
And Big Foot was first to die  
And over the noise of the rifles  
You could hear the babies cry  
Big chief Big Foot  
It's good that you can't see  
Revenge is being wrought  
By Custer's 7th Cavalry  
Then smoke hung over the canyon  
On that cold December day  
All was death and dying  
Around where Big Foot lay  
Farther on up the canyon  
Some had tried to run and hide  
But death showed no favorites  
Women, men, and children died  
One side called it a massacre  
The other a victory  
But the white flag is still waving  
Today at Wounded Knee  
Big chief Big Foot  
Your Minneconjou band  
Is more than remembered here  
In South Dakota land

The morning passed so quickly it was time for them to meet  
It was twenty past eleven when they walked out in the street  
Folks were watching from their windows every-body held their breath  
They knew this handsome ranger was about to meet his death  
About to meet his death  
  
There was forty feet between them when they stopped to make their play  
And the swiftness of the ranger is still talked about to-day  
Texas Red had not cleared leather when a bullet fairly ripped

It was over in a moment and the folks had gathered round

He went down to Independence Hall and there was a treaty signed  
That promised peace with the USA and Indian rights combined

Although he showed them another plan and showed them another way

But I don't think you can make it and neither could I and anyway  
  
I never could, never would, never will ever kill what's between us  
So let's try again, we'll start a brand new dance between old friends  
  
Baby, come here love ain't disappeared, you're just feeling low  
And let me tell you my darling, it's a feeling I know  
It don't mean too much we just got out of touch  
Well that's easy to change

And anyway  
  
I never could, never would, never will ever kill what's between us

The mother brought a light and held her daughter tight

Her mother wiped the tears and said, ""See honey, you're only dreaming  
Your dad must work today, he has to draw his pay""  
She left her then but still could hear her cry time after time

Then the countryside was shaken by a mighty rumble  
And fear for miles around was the trembling of the ground  
The little girl was fast asleep, yet cried out one more time

Ten thousand tears and two weeks later deep in the smoking ground

In the shadows down below  
  
Following the footsteps  
Through the neon darkened corridors  
Of silent desperation  
Never speakin' to a soul

Has the dirty smell of dyin'  
'Cause it's never seen the sunshine

In the lives of all the lonely men  
Who reach for anything they can  
To keep from goin' home

She picked up the coaloil and hickernuts and said  
I sure do thank ye and quickly closed the door

I pinned a flower on her heart, I swore we'd never be apart  
She vowed her love forever and as I kissed her did the same  
Dorraine, my Dorraine, my dark haired little angel  
My belle of Ponchartrain  
We sat down on the dock and with our hearts and fingers locked  
We laughed and talked and joked about when our names are the same  
And joking I said honey are you marrying me for money  
And it took just one quick look to tell it hurt my dear Dorraine  
She jumped and stood above me and she cried why you don't love me  
I'm rowing home across the lake you won't see me again  
I called and called some more but she rowed fast from the shore  
And the clouds brought by a wind began to rain on Ponchartrain  
Dorraine, I called Dorraine  
Come back my little angel my belle of Ponchartrain  
The storm should make her learn that she should make a swift return  
But as the rain fell harder I lost sight of my Dorraine  
As panic gripped my heart I drew the oars and made my start  
To look for her on raging waters and the rain on Ponchartrain  
At darkness I still called but no one heard my cries at all  
And when the daybreak came then others helped me look for my Dorraine  
But there was not a thing afloat except the oars from her rowboat  
For all was lost upon the choppy waves and rain on Ponchartrain  
Now I come day after day to where my sweetheart rowed away  
And I gaze across the water of the rainy Ponchartrain  
Just one thing and nothing more ever floated back to shore  
Was this flower I hold it is the one I pinned on my Dorraine

I had a real slow shoeshine man  
I said you don't pop that rag like some of 'em can

He sang every song to the redhead she smiled back at him  
Then he came and sat at her table where the lights were low and dim  
What Frankie didn't know wouldn't hurt her none  
Then the redhead jumped up and slapped him  
She slapped him a time or two

It's good to touch the green, green grass of home.  
  
Then I awake and look around me,  
At the four gray walls that surround me,  
And I realize that I was only dreaming.  
For there's a guard, and there's a sad old padre,  
Arm in arm, we'll walk at daybreak.  
Again, I'll touch the green, green grass of home.  
  
Yes, they'll all come to see me  
In the shade of the old oak tree,  
As they lay me 'neath the green, green grass of home.

His wife watched TV all the time cause she got bored  
Then one day she found a TV preacher she adored  
And she gave all of Harley's hard earned money to the Lord  
Harley started drinkin' wound up in Betty Ford to see if he could by a

Then some kid who worked in Harley's factory he got himself this big idea

"(Joy to the world the Lord is come)  
Here was a man a man who was born in a small village the son of a peasant
woman  
He grew up in another small village  
Until he reached the age of thirty he worked as a carpenter  
  
Then for three years he was a traveling minister  
But he never traveled more than two hundred miles from where he was born  
And where he did go he usually walked  
He never held political office he never wrote a book never bought a home  
  
Never had a family he never went to college and he never set foot inside a big
city  
Yes here was a man  
Though he never did one on the things usually associated with greatness  
He had no credentials but himself he had nothing to do with this world  
  
Except through the devine purpose that brought him to this world  
While he was still a young man the tide of popular opinion turned against him  
Most of his friends ran away one of them denied him  
One of them betrayed him and turned him over to his enemies  
  
Then he went through the mockery of a trial  
And was nailed to a cross between two thieves  
And even while he was dying his executioners gambled  
For the only piece of property that he had in this world  
  
And that was his robe his purple robe  
When he was dead he was taken down from the cross  
And laid in a borrowed grave provided by compassionate friends  
More than nineteen centuries have come and gone  
  
And today he's a centerpiece of the human race  
Our leader in the column to human destiny  
I think I'm well within the mark when I say that all of the armies that ever
marched  
All of the navies that ever sailed the seas  
  
All of the legislative bodies that ever sat and all of the kings that ever
reigned  
All of them put together have not affected the life of man on this earth  
So powerfully as that one solitary life  
Here was a man (joy to the world the Lord is come)

I sailed a schooner round the Horn to Mexico  
I went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow

Where steel and water did collide

I had everything that money could bring  
And I took it with a gun

When a redneck grabbed my shirt

Three polaroids, two young hearts, and one real cool, black, leather jacket  
  
A little tattered and torn, it still keeps me warm on a Friday night  
Bandana patch from kickin some ass in a frat boy fight  
You wore it in the stands at the football games  
Some ink beneath the sleeve, I still wear your name  
And I loved you girl, yeah, I still love you girl  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I know you grew up, I grew up, too  
You got two kids, hell, I got two kids, too  
Thank God they look like you  
  
And every night I put it back it on and Im sixteen sittin next to you  
Down by the river if you get the shivers, Ill put it around you  
Were makin them memories in the moonlight and red wine, vinyl static  
Three words, two rings, and one real cool, black, leather jacket  
  
Well, there's nothin in the world makes me feel more alive  
When its just you and me and the moon is high  
I slip into the sleeves and with your hand in mine  
I go back to the night when I fell into your eyes  
  
Two kids just fallin in love  
And here we are right now, good heavens above  
Its only gettin better, baby  
Its only getting better, baby  
I just love that black, leather jacket

That tell you there's a fork in the road  
And you don't think it's right but you're both turnin' away  
And the ending is always the same  
When suddenly parallel lives drift apart  
And there's no one accepting the blame

Go it alone for awhile

An old love story she wishes portrayed her life  
No one would know what goes on in her mind

She never even knew she had a choice  
And that's what happens when the only voice she hears is telling her she can't  
Stupid boy  
Stupid boy  
  
So, what made you think you could take a life  
And just push it, push it around  
I guess to build yourself up so high  
You had to take her and break her down  
Well  
  
She laid her heart and soul right in your hands  
And you stole her every dream, and you crushed her plans  
She never even knew she had a choice  
And that's what happens when the only voice she hears is telling her she can't  
  
You stupid boy  
You always had to be right  
And now you lost the only thing that ever made you feel alive, oh ho  
Yeah, yeah

"I've loved you since the very first day  
When I caught you looking my way  
A smile and just knew it.  
And up until you came along, no one ever heard my song,  
Now its climbing with a bullet.  
  
Its nice to have someone, so honestly devoted,  
But when it's said and done, girl I hope you know that,  
  
The traveling, the singing, it don't mean nothing without you  
The fast cars, the guitars, they are all just second to,  
This life, this love that you and I have been dreaming of, for so long  
It'd all be as good as gone, without you.  
  
Oh ho, without you, hey hey  
  
Along comes a baby girl, and suddenly my little world,  
Just got a whole lot bigger, yes it did.  
And people that I barely knew, who love me 'cause I'm part of you  
Man it's tough to figure  
How two souls can be, miles from one another  
But still you and me, have somehow found each other.  
  
The traveling, the singing, it don't mean nothing without you  
The fast cars, the guitars, they are all just second to,  
This life, this love that you and I have been dreaming of, for so long  
It'd all be as good as gone, without you.  
  
Without you, oh oh  
Without you I'd survive, but I'd have to have the notion  
That I could live this life, just going through the motions  
  
The traveling, the singing, it don't mean nothing without you  
The fast cars, the guitars, they are all just second to,  
This life, this love that you and I have been building up so high  
It's never gonna touch the sky, without you.  
  
Mm, without you  
Without you, baby, baby, baby without you  
Without you.

It had been a long time, but later last night

I was just a kid, a motherless child  
No one to watch over me I was runnin' wild  
Free of all responsibility 'til my life

Yeah, it caught up with me

I've been tryin' my best to get along

There's nothing left to say, but  
  
Take your records, take your freedom  
Take your memories I don't need 'em  
Take your space and take your reasons  
But you'll think of me  
And take your cat and leave my sweater  
'Cause we have nothing left to weather  
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better  
But you'll think of me, you'll think of me  
  
I went out driving trying to clear my head  
I tried to sweep out all the ruins that my emotions left  
I guess I'm feeling just a little tired of this  
And all the baggage that seems to still exist  
It seems the only blessing I have left to my name  
Is not knowing what we could have been  
What we should have been  
So  
  
Take your records, take your freedom  
Take your memories I don't need 'em  
Take your space and take your reasons  
But you'll think of me  
And take your cat and leave my sweater  
'Cause we have nothing left to weather  
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better  
But you'll think of me  
  
Someday I'm gonna run across your mind  
Don't worry, I'll be fine  
I'm gonna be alright  
While you're sleeping with your pride  
Wishin' I could hold you tight  
I'll be over you  
And on with my life  
  
So take your records, take your freedom  
Take your memories I don't need 'em  
And take your cat and leave my sweater  
'Cause we have nothing left to weather  
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better

Baby can't you see that we were meant to be together  
Yeah the joinin' of our hearts is written in the stars  
We've got a love made in heaven  
So baby take my hand I want to be your man forever  
  
Well I can't think of anyone else it's true  
All day long there's no one on my mind but you  
And I have loved you since you were a little girl  
You mean everything to me and you're all I'll ever need in this world

Every time I look into your eyes I see  
The one I want beside me for eternity  
You could make me the happiest man alive

"I used to cry out in the middle of the night  
Baby hold me tight  
But there was no one beside me when I opened my eyes

Something inside me changed and I think I might  
Be starting over  
I don't wanna run  
Oh no, cause you might be the one, baby

If ever I could love  
I think it could be with you  
If ever thought I found somebody so true  
I wonder if you feel  
The same way that I do  
If ever I could love  
I think it could be with you  
  
You know I can't read your mind love  
But it seems to me  
That your heart and mine tonight are  
Defying gravity  
There's something so familiar  
And still so unknown  
The closer we get I swear it feels like coming home  
And I'm ready to be brave  
Oh yea and you look at me say

I was scared to love again  
Till the day that came  
When she walked out of my life  
I got hurt so bad  
I swear I'd never let another inside this heart of mine  
But you touch my hand and every plan that I had  
Disappeared like a fallen star  
There's a new beginning and I'm moving to the rhythm  
Of a beating braver heart  
A braver heart  
If ever I could love, oh oh  
If ever I could love, yea yea

Everybody's got a story they can tell

Gimmie one chance, baby, I can set you free

When there's no one you can trust

Baby, don't ya know that I won't ever let ya down  
Come on now, woo

Well I was talking with my baby  
Over a small glass of tea  
When she asked a loaded question  
She said ""How do you feel about me?""  
My mind was racin' I was pacin'

And there was only one thing left to do  
I feel it coming on

Was all that wasted time, all that wasted time  
  
Out of nowhere, it slipped away  
And the rope by the river hangs silently  
And the town that we knew ain't nothing like it used to be  
Ah, I can't explain

And the days got sold to the grid and the game

We had the guns on the radio  
After all this time it still feels, feels so good  
  
When I think about those summer nights  
Singing out the window, on the back roads, Sweet Child of Mine  
Sipping on the local's spark of light  
Ain't it funny how the best days of my life  
Was all that wasted time, all that wasted time  
Swinging on the line  
Living all that wasted time  
  
Hey, hey, now  
Summer dresses drying out on the hood of the car  
Only music that we had was out the left speaker  
We were living every second 'til the time ran out  
We had nothing but we had it all  
  
When I think about those summer night  
Sneaking out the window, running back roads  
Your hand in mine  
We were going nowhere, we were so alive  
Uh huh, ain't it crazy how the best days of my life  
Was all that wasted time, all that wasted time  
We were swinging out on the line  
Living all that wasted time  
  
Hey, you know oh  
All that wasted time  
Don't you feel it coming on back now  
Time, time, time

I could sing along without thinkin bout you every time it came on  
Every beat, every line, every word, every time  
When a road was a road  
I could roll on through without wishin that empty seat was you  
Money was gas, dreams were dust  
Love was fast and we were us  
  
Shotgun sunset  
A cool mint kiss  
Backseat promise  
Breaking it  
Floorboard feeling

Far too young to know that summers end

For the first time in my life  
And that's somethin'

To this day I still taste that first kiss  
How I prayed it wouldn't end  
In a way seeing you like this  
I guess it never really did

Lookin' like Blackbeard in his day  
A brother in arms just like me  
I was born a son of the sea  
I can't be still, I can't be tied

When the wind fills my sail  
Riding on a lifelong swell  
Let my heart take me where it wants to go  
That's the soul of a sailor, the soul of a sailor  
  
He slid a stool and a beer to me  
Said, you know, we're both a dying breed  
Here's to love lost and new found friends  
And living out life in the boat we're in  
I can't be still, I can't be tied  
The only time I feel alive is

Riding on a lifelong swell

"Gonna cash my check before the drive-through closes

"Walking along beneath the lights of that miracle mile  
Me and Mary making our way into the night  
You can hear the cries from the carnival rides, the pinball  
Bells, and the skee ball signs  
Watching the summer sun fall out of sight

Making it's way past the hotel walls to fill the street  
Mary is holding both of her shoes in her hand  
Said she likes to feel the sand beneath her feet  
  
And in the morning I'm leaving, making my way back to Cleveland  
So tonight I hope that I will do just fine  
And I don't see how you could ever be

In the midst of the music  
I tell her I love her  
And we both laugh, cause we know it isn't true  
Oh, but Mary, there's a summer drawing to an end tonight

There was glory in the air, there was dinner on the ground  
And my sins went for many, were washed away and gone  
Along with a buffalo nickel I forgot to leave at home  
But that seemed like such a small, small price to pay  
For the blessed peace of mind that came to me that day

"She's thinkin' about what her kids are doing  
Five miles away it's almost time for bed  
They're brushing teeth and hearing one more story  
And in the mirror, she paints her lips bright red  
  
She wishes she could call and say she loves them  
But the boss man says no calls go out or in  
So she puts on a dress that might feel pretty  
If she didn't have to take it off again  
  
[Chorus:]  
She's dancin' for the groceries  
She's dancin' for the rent  
She's dancin' for the credit card that she's already spent  
In sequins and in laces, she's dancing for the braces  
So her kids can have a perfect smile someday  
Smiling while she dances, is the price she has to pay  
  
They tell her in this job there is no future  
So get it while you can cause looks don't last  
There's money in those pockets for the taking  
And if you do it right it makes the time go fast  
  
The music's loud, the drinks are mostly water  
Whatever her name is tonight she can't recall  
The business men stare at the single mother  
Who's smiling while she's staring at the wall  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Someday she'll have a house out in the country  
Someday she'll see the other side of dawn  
And no one will ever know what it was she did before  
But she just heard the DJ say ""you're on""  
And the lights come up and they play her song  
  
She's dancin' for the groceries  
She's dancin' for the rent  
She's dancin' for the credit card that she's already spent  
In sequins and in laces, she's dancing for the braces

Maybe I'm afraid of being free

Wake up and you're twenty-five and your high school sweetheart becomes your

Turning into moms and dads next thing you know your ""better half""  
Of fifty years is there in bed  
And you're praying God takes you instead  
Trust me friend a hundred years goes faster than you think  
So don't blink  
  
I was glued to my TV when it looked like he looked at me and said  
""Best start putting first things first""  
Cause when your hourglass runs out of sand  
You can't flip it over and start again  
Take every breathe God gives you for what it's worth

"[Verse:]  
13 in the thick of a cornfield

My first chance I got out of Smallville

[Verse 2:]  
My first stop was a pawn shop  
Dropped a pretty penny for a cheap fender with a song in it  
I had a quick right hand, and an old band  
I thought good friends would make a good band  
Life has it's way of provin' you wrong, don't it?

I've been right and I've been wrong  
Somewhere in between for so long  
Live the night, miss the light, and I've been shown it  
Life has it's way of keepin' you strong, don't it?  
  
[Verse 2:]  
So there I was, a long way from nowhere  
Frightened mind, spare time and a blank stare  
I was just numb enough not to feel a thang  
After all we didn't share a set of rings  
Besides, how bad could it be!  
She never found out I'd never come clean  
Life has it's way of leadin' you on, don't it?  
  
[Chorus:]  
I've been right and I've been wrong  
Somewhere in between for so long  
Live the night, miss the light, and I've been shown it

[Verse 3:]  
Well now, have you ever been down the old back road?  
On-Time ballroom  
It's a trip, it's a bitch, it's an on and off light switch  
Nobody follows  
Everybody's got their own past  
Skeletons to stash, don't look back if you do laugh  
Life has it's way of movin' you on, don't it?

"On a hillside in Hazzard  
Sets a new double-wide  
God's little acre  
Your paradise  
  
A poor boy found heaven  
With a good country girl  
He had all he wanted  
She was his whole world  
  
But working the coal mine  
Can wear a man down  
He started spending  
Too much time in town  
  
He found temptation  
Fell under it's spell  
And hillbilly Heaven  
Went to honky tonk Hell  
  
From hillbilly Heaven  
To honky tonk Hell  
From a warm home fire burning  
To a cold, cheap motel  
And an angel is crying  
'Cause her good man fell  
From hillbilly Heaven  
To honky tonk Hell  
  
Somewhere in Hazzard  
On a dark, dead-end street  
Where whiskey and heartache  
And old memories meet  
  
He looks for salvation  
In a bottle each night  
And just goes on livin'  
Though he's lost his life  
  
Now there's a job in the coal mine  
That needs to be filled  
And a heartache in Hazzard  
That won't ever heal  
  
He had it all  
Now it's all for sale  
And hillbilly Heaven's  
Gone to honky tonk Hell  
From hillbilly Heaven  
To honky tonk Hell  
From a warm home fire burning  
To a cold, cheap motel  
And an angel is crying  
'Cause her good man fell

Singin' 'bout God, brimstone, and fire  
And the smell of Sunday chicken after church

And the sixteen summers I shared with him  
Now ""Only The Good Die Young"" stops me in my tracks  
Every time I hear that song, I go back, I go back

So weak and tired,I can barely stand,  
From being up all night, praying she'd say yes.  
So with a hopeful heart, I hit one knee

It was the moment of truth, I was scared to death.  
My life hung on what that tear meant,  
Then she smiled at me,  
And I lost it.

No one can make me cry,  
Make me laugh,  
Make me smile,

Better or worse,

It's real love,

If I lost it.

You used to call and tell me, ""you're on your way.""

Braided hair and a tye-dyed t-shirt on.  
Talkin' to himself about Vietnam,  
About the tour he did and the deal he got.  
He said,""This world ain't the same if you ask me.

I'd be rollin' on a river with Creedence.  
Stealin' kisses from Peggy Sue.  
I'd be knee-deep in sand on  
A Panama Beach In the spring of '72.  
I'd be wastin' away on the dock of the bay,  
Watchin' the tide roll in.  
He said,""What I wouldn't give just to  
Live those songs again.""  
  
Saw him workin' the counter at Walgreens...  
With a new haircut and a Bachelor's Degree.  
Talkin' to himself about his raw deal,

Smiles and says hello to everybody and tries to do her best

We sat there and talked as an hour passed like old friends.  
I saw a black and white picture and it caught my stare.  
It was a pretty girl with bu-font hair  
He said, that's my Bonnie, taken 'bout a year after we wed.  
He said, I spent five years in the bar when the cancer took her from me.  
But I've been sober three years now  
'Cause the one thing's stronger than the whiskey  
  
Was the sight of her holdin' my baby girl  
The way she adored that string of pearls  
I gave her the day that our youngest boy Earl  
Married his high school love.  
And its a new t-shirt sayin' I'm a grandpa.  
Bein' right there as our time got small  
And holdin' her hand when good the Lord called her up  
Yeah man that's the good stuff.  
  
He said, when you get home she'll start to cry.  
When she says, I'm sorry, say so am I.  
Look into those eyes so deep in love and drink it up  
'Cause that's the good stuff.  
  
That's the good stuff.

"It was early one morning  
Playa del Carmen  
That's when I first met Jose  
He had a 12 foot Schooner  
A 3 foot cooler  
Full of the catch of the day  
And he was wrinkled from grinning  
From all of the sun he had been in  
He was barefoot, cerveza in hand  
He said ""Gracias senor"", when I paid him too much for  
All of the Snapper he had  
Now I told him my friend it ain't nothing  
In the best broken Spanish I knew  
I said I make a good living  
Back home where I'm from  
He smiled and said Amigo me too  
  
He said I fish and I play my guitar  
I laugh at the bar with my friends  
I go home to my wife  
I pray every night  
I can do it all over again  
  
Somewhere over Texas  
I thought of my Lexus  
And all the stuff I work so hard for  
And all the things that I've gathered  
From climbing that ladder  
Didn't make much sense anymore  
They say my nest egg ain't ready to hatch yet  
They keep holding my feet to the fire  
They call it paying the price  
So that one day in life  
I'll have what I need to retire  
  
And just fish  
And play my guitar  
And laugh at the bar with my friends  
And go home to my wife  
And pray every night  
I can do it all over again  
  
And to think that I thought for a while there that I had it made  
When the truth is I'm really just dying  
To live like Jose  
  
And just fish  
Play my guitar  
Laugh at the bar with my friends  
Go home to my wife  
Pray every night  
I can do it all over again  
  
Wouldn't that be the life?  
Wouldn't that be the life?

A touch of crazy hides behind her wild smile  
So simple yet experimental  
Innocent but still a little wild child

I say, didn't look so great, I say you look good  
Aww she took her hand ran it up my thigh

See can you make it on the wild ride (wild ride)  
Don't try no shakin' on the wild ride (wild ride)

In tiny little pieces blown from side to side  
My heart was shattered along with my pride  
Guess you can't keep 'em on the wild ride

I could see me hanging lights on our first Christmas tree  
I could see us nail those numbers on the door that afternoon

They added on where we thought we would  
You always said it would sure look good  
They cut down that tree we were afraid would fall  
  
Looks like they picked up right where we left off

I could see me chasing you around with a water gun  
I could see us there together

"No one seemed to notice the man beside the road  
He was just a ragged soldier out there in the cold  
But he seemed to have a purpose only known to him  
As he walked along the streets that night through the town of Bethlehem.  
  
In his head he held a memory of all the wars he'd known  
In his hand he clutched a medal for the bravery he'd shown  
And the weight of every battle he carried in his heart  
But his eyes were clear and searching for a manger in the dark.  
  
[Chorus]  
Some are born to greatness, some are born to fall  
Some are bound to be forgotten like they never lived at all  
But we're all born to know Him and stand before His light  
Like the soldier who found his king tonight.  
  
He had marched for politicians, served under their command  
And he fought for all the causes that he did not understand  
But it was something deep inside him now that led him on his way  
With a single star to guide him to were the baby lay.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
He stood before the Son of God, come to pay our debt  
He smiled up at the soldier that the world would soon forget  
So he held out his medal and said this for you I bring  
There he swore allegiance to the newborn baby King.

Every piece was small  
And I didn't have a coat  
And it was away down in the fall  
Mama sewed the rags together  
So in every piece with luck  
She made my coat of many colors  
That I was so proud of  
As she sewed, she told a story  
From the Bible she had read  
About a coat of many colors Joseph wore  
And then she said,  
Perhaps this coat  
Will bring you good luck and happiness  
And I just couldn't wait to wear it  
And my mama blessed it with a kiss  
My coat of many colors  
That my mama made for me  
Made only from rags  
That I wore it so proudly  
Although we had no money  
Well, I was rich as I could be  
In my coat of many colors  
I hurried off to school  
Just to find the others laughing  
And making fun of me  
In my coat of many colors  
My mama made for me  
And no, I couldn't understand it  
For I felt I was rich  
And I told them all the story  
Mama told me while she sewed  
And how my coat of many colors  
Was worth more than all their clothes  
But they didn't understand it  
And I tried to make them see  
""But one is only poor  
Only if he chooses to be.""  
Now I know we had no money  
In my coat of many colors  
My mama made for me  
Made just for me

I'm driven as I am  
Is there something that I have  
That makes you give a damn.  
  
Be my comfort when the world  
Waves me to the ground  
Take me when I've lost my way  
Let me know I'm found.  
  
Be a blanket to my soul  
Wrap it all around  
Be a feather babe to me  
And lay my body down.  
  
Touch me with your finger tips  
Give my burdens rest  
Tell me not to worry so  
I know that you know best.

And hold them in your arm  
Lie against me in the dark  
And show me I've come home.

"In a bar in Toledo  
Across from the depot  
On a bar stool she took off her ring  
I thought I'd get closer  
So I walked on over  
I sat down and asked her name  
When the drinks finally hit her  
She said I'm no quitter

I thought how he looked out of place  
He came to the woman  
Who sat there beside me  
He had a strange look on his face  
The big hands were calloused  
He looked like a mountain  
For a minute I thought I was dead  
But he started shakin'  
His big heart was breakin'  
He turned to the woman and said  
  
You picked a fine time to leave me Lucille  
With four hungry children  
And a crop in the field  
I've had some bad times  
Lived through some sad times  
But this time your hurtin' won't heal  
You picked a fine time to leave me Lucille  
  
After he left us  
I ordered more whisky  
I thought how she'd made him look small  
From the lights of the bar room  
To a rented hotel room  
We walked without talkin' at all  
She was a beauty  
But when she came to me  
She must have thought I'd lost my mind  
I could'nt hold her

Kept coming back time after time

Pour some whiskey on my flame

Yet it's worth more gold than any man has ever seen  
And although no one has fallen for her like she's fallen for them  
She says her heart isn't broken, it's only broken in

Stood through the one-night stands  
She's ready for someone to love her

Well she has had her fill of those unfullfilling men  
You know the kind that come calling never to call back again  
Oh she's bound and determined not to be fooled anymore

Oh don't worry dad ya know  
It don't matter what we do  
I don't call him daddy  
He could never be like you  
Never be like you  
  
God bless their little hearts  
They're the ones who really pay  
When mom and dad can't get along  
And go their seperate ways  
In a way I'm glad there's someone  
There to fill the empty place  
Tears of understanding  
Streak down a dirty face

He is quite a little man  
Growing up as fast as he can  
And I don't get to see him  
Half as much as I had planned  
There's so much I need to tell him  
So precious little time  
A little rain on the window  
In a little way goodbye

The mantle is cruel holding pictures of you  
Your scent lingers there, in the bed that we shared

These rooms are unkind to play tricks on my mind  
I can see how you've lived without me

Lady, I'm your knight in shining armor and I love you.  
You have made me what I am, and I am yours.  
My love, there's so many ways I want to say I love you.

You have come into my life and made me whole.  
Forever let me wake to see you each and every morning.  
Let me hear you whisper softly in my ear.  
In my eyes I see no one else but you.  
There's no other love like our love.  
And yes, oh yes, I'll always want you near me.  
I've waited for you so long.

"We only knew each other by letter,  
When I met her over the train,  
When the smoke cleared and the dust was still,  
She was standing there speaking my name.  
  
I guarantee she looked like an angel,  
I couldn't think of what I should say,  
But when Adam saw Eve in the garden,  
I believe he felt the selfsame way.  
  
I handed her up on the wagon,  
And I loaded up her trunk behind,  
She was sitting up there with the gold in her hair,  
I tried to get a hope on my mind.  
  
You think that you could love me, Mary? ,  
You think we got a chance of a life,  
Do you think that you could love me, Mary?  
Now you are to be my wife.  
  
We finally headed out of the station,  
And drove up my home trail,  
And when we came to the farm she laid a hand on my arm,  
I thought my resolution would fail.  
  
Now froze as she stepped through the doorway,  
And I stood there as still as could be,  
I said: ""I know, it ain't much it needs a woman's touch,  
Perhaps she turned around and looked at me.""  
  
Do you think that ...  
  
We had a prairie wedding,  
There was a preacher and a neighbor or two,  
I gave my golden thing, a gold wedding ring,  
And the both of us said, ""I do"".  
  
Now when the sun is going down in the prairie,  
And the golden hair is a flame,  
I say ""do you really love me, Mary?""  
I hold her and I whisper her name.

Most days he went hungry, then the summer came  
He met a girl known on the strip as San Francisco's Mabel Joy  
Destitutions child born of an L.A. street called shame  
  
Growing up came quietly in the arms of Mabel Joy  
Laughter found their mornings, brought a meaning to his life  
Yes, the night before she left, sleep came and left that Waycross  
Country boy with dreams of Georgia cotton and a California wife  
  
Sunday morning found him standing 'neath the red light of her door  
When a right cross sent him reeling, put him face down on the floor  
In place of Mabel Joy he found a merchant mad marine  
He growled that Georgia neck is red, but sonny your still green  
  
He turned twenty-one in a gray rock federal prison  
The old judge had no mercy for a Waycross Georgia boy  
Starin' at those four gray, in silence he would listen  
That midnight freight he knew would take him back to Mabel Joy  
  
Sunday morning found him lyin' 'neath the red light of her door  
With a bullet in his side he cried have you seen Mabel Joy  
Stunned and shaken someone said she's not here no more  
She left this house four years today

Passing my world to his and gave my heart the cause  
I believed him everything is sad I thought that how it was  
I tied the best years of my life around his love  
  
I crossed the bridge of memory  
Where the grass was green and his sweet dream was mine  
But all about is over now he's broken all those precious ties that bind  
I tied the best years of my life

We were poor but we had love,  
That's the one thing that daddy made sure of,  
He shoveled coal to make a poor man's dollar.

Mommy scrubbed our clothes on a washboard ever' day.

At night we'd sleep cause we were tired

"Frosty the snowman was a jolly happy soul  
With a corncob pipe and a button nose and two eyes made out of coal  
Frosty the snowman is a fairy tale they say  
He was made of snow but the children know how he came to life one day  
There must have been some magic in that old silk that they found  
For when they placed it on his head he began to dance around  
Frosty the snowman was alive as he could be  
And the children say he could laugh and play just the same as you and me  
  
Frosty the snowman knew the sun was hot that day  
So he said let's run and we'll have some fun before I melt away  
Down to the village with a broomstick in his hand  
Running here and there all around the square saying catch me if you can  
He led them down the streets of town right to the traffic cop  
And he only paused a moment when he heard him holler stop  
Frosty the snowman had to hurry on his way  
But he waved goodbye sayin' don't you cry I'll be back again some day

"It wasn't very long ago that he held me so close  
But the little love he had has died for me who loved him most  
He left me for another and didn't say goodbye  
And if you're next to love him then you'll be next to cry  
Get set for a heartache that's all I can say  
Get set for a heartache on its way

He'll make you think he loves you too but you'll find it's not true  
You'll learn that when you need him most he'll be with someone new  
Your love will all be wasted that's how it was with me  
And soon heartaches will tell you you're just his used to be

Somewhere waiting, wondering just like me  
  
I've been waiting all my life to love you  
All that time I was dreaming of you  
Your love babe  
I've been waiting all my life  
  
And did I lose faith, did I lose heart  
Maybe I did, but I never lost my way  
To where you are - I've been  
  
Waiting all my life to find you  
Always been one step behind you  
Your love babe  
I've been waiting all my life  
  
I've been waiting all my life to love you  
All that time I was dreaming of you

Your love I've been waiting all my life

"I can take the rain on the roof of this empty house

I can take a few tears now and then and just let 'em out

There are days every now and again I pretend I'm okay

And havin' so much to say  
And watchin' you walk away  
And never knowin' what could've been  
And not seein' that lovin' you  
Is what I was trying to do  
  
It's hard to deal with the pain of losin' you everywhere I go  
But I'm doing it  
It's hard to force that smile when I see our old friends and I'm alone  
Still harder gettin' up, gettin' dressed, livin' with this regret  
But I know if I could do it over  
I would trade, give away all the words that I saved in my heart  
That I left unspoken

Roundin' third to score that winning run  
You always played with passion no matter what the game  
When you took the stage you shined just like the sun

Oh, but I do have one burning question  
Who told you life wasn't worth the fight  
They were wrong  
They lied  
And now you're gone  
And we cried

While there's light at the end of the tunnel  
Keep running towards it  
Releasing the pressure, that's my heartache  
Soon this dam will break

And the keys to Jenny's heart  
A fifth of whiskey on the floorboard  
Almost gone

Had only one thing on their mind  
Never saw the flashin' lights  
Or the train comin' on  
Now there's a wreath and two small crosses  
On the right side of the road  
Reminders of a love that won't grow

Recalling all the sweet things you said  
This was the day I was gonna hurt you bad  
Called out your name, but you  
Didn't answer back

You're gonna believe them  
And when you're fifteen  
  
And your first kiss makes your head spin around  
  
But in your life you'll do things  
Greater than dating the boy on the football team  
But I didn't know it at fifteen  
  
When all you wanted  
Was to be wanted  
Wish you could go back  
And tell yourself what you know now  
  
Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday  
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine  
And Abigail gave everything she had  
To a boy who changed his mind  
And we both cried  
  
'Cause when you're fifteen,  
Somebody tells you they love you  
You're gonna believe them  
And when you're fifteen  
  
Don't forget to look before you fall  
  
I've found time can heal most anything  
And you just might find who you're supposed to be  
I didn't know who I was supposed to be  
At fifteen  
  
La la la la la  
Your very first day  
Take a deep breath girl  
And take a deep breath as you walk through the doors

"Hey Stephen, I know looks can be deceiving

I don't always have to be alone

Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain, so  
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you  
Can't help it if there's no one else  
Mmm I can't help myself  
  
Hey Stephen, I've been holding back this feeling  
So I've got some things to say to you  
I've seen it all, so I thought  
But I've never seen nobody shine the way you do  
The way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name  
It's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change  
Hey Stephen, why are people always leaving  
I think you and I should stay the same

Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel  
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain, so  
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you  
Can't help it if there's no one else  
Mmm I can't help myself  
  
They're dimming the street lights, you're perfect for me  
Why aren't you here tonight?  
I'm waiting alone now so come on and come out  
And pull me near and shine, shine, shine  
  
Hey Stephen, I could give you fifty reasons  
Why I should be the one you choose  
All those other girls, well they're beautiful  
But would they write a song for you?

Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel  
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain, so  
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you  
Can't help it if there's no one else  
  
I can't help myself if you look like an angel  
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain, so  
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you  
Can't help it if there's no one else

Away

Fresh on the pavement  
I ran off the plane  
That July ninth  
The beat of your heart  
It jumps through your shirt  
I can still feel your arms  
  
But now I'll go sit on the floor  
Wearing your clothes  
All that I know is  
I don't know how to be something you missed  
Never thought we'd have a last kiss  
Never imagined we'd end like this  
Your name, forever the name on my lips  
  
I do remember  
The swing in your step  
The life of the party, you're showing off again  
And I roll my eyes and then  
You pull me in  
I'm not much for dancing  
But for you I did  
  
Because I love your handshake  
Meetin' my father  
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets  
How you kissed me when I was in the middle of saying something  
There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions

And it's a beautiful day  
And something reminds you  
You wish you had stayed  
You can plan for a change in weather and time

Wearing your clothes

A blue bonnet with rain on it, quiet winters and leaves that always fall

Oil paintings and making every detail turn out right  
One last dance, new romance, living for that love at first sight

"I said remember this moment  
In the back of my mind  
The time we stood with our shaking hands  
The crowds in stands went wild  
We were the kings and the queens  
And they read off our names  
The night you danced like you knew our lives  
Would never be the same  
You held your head like a hero  
On a history book page  
It was the end of a decade  
But the start of an age  
  
Long live the walls we crashed through  
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you  
I was screaming, ""long live all the magic we made""  
And bring on all the pretenders  
One day we will be remembered  
  
I said remember this feeling  
I passed the pictures around  
Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines  
Wishing for right now  
We are the kings and the queens  
You traded your baseball cap for a crown  
When they gave us our trophies  
And we held them up for our town  
And the cynics were outraged  
Screaming, ""this is absurd""  
'Cause for a moment a band of thieves in ripped up jeans got to rule the world  
  
Long live the walls we crashed through  
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you  
I was screaming, ""long live all the magic we made""  
And bring on all the pretenders  
I'm not afraid  
  
Long live all the mountains we moved  
I had the time of my life  
Fighting dragons with you  
I was screaming, ""long live the look on your face""  
And bring on all the pretenders  
One day we will be remembered  
  
Hold on to spinning around  
Confetti falls to the ground  
May these memories break our fall  
  
Can you take a moment  
Promise me this:  
That you'll stand by me forever  
But if God forbid fate should step in  
And force us into a goodbye  
If you have children someday  
When they point to the pictures  
Please tell them my name  
Tell them how the crowds went wild  
Tell them how I hope they shine  
  
Long live the walls we crashed through  
I had the time of my life with you  
  
Long, long live the walls we crashed through  
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you  
And I was screaming, ""long live all the magic we made""  
And bring on all the pretenders  
I'm not afraid  
  
Singing long live all the mountains we moved  
I had the time of my life  
Fighting dragons with you  
And long, long live the look on your face  
And bring on all the pretenders  
One day, we will be remembered

And say hello  
  
Little did I know  
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles

And I was crying on the staircase  
Begging you, please, don't go  
  
And I said,  
""Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone  
I'll be waiting, all that's left to do is run  
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess  
It's a love story, baby just say yes  
  
So I sneak out to the garden to see you  
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew  
So close your eyes, escape this town for a little while

But you were everything to me, I was begging you, please, don't go

Wondering if you were ever coming around  
My faith in you was fading

I keep waiting for you but you never come  
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think""

I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about  
And she's got everything that I have to live without  
  
Drew talks to me, I laugh 'cause it is so damn funny  
That I can't even see anyone when he's with me  
He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right,  
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night  
  
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar  
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star  
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do  
  
Drew walks by me, can he tell that I can't breathe?  
And there he goes, so perfectly,  
The kind of flawless I wish I could be  
She'd better hold him tight, give him all her love  
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky cause  
  
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar  
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star  
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

I'll put his picture down and maybe  
Get some sleep tonight  
  
Because he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar  
The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart  
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

It's the age of princesses and pirate ships  
And the seven dwarfs  
And Daddy's smart  
And you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world  
  
And now I know why the all the trees change in the fall  
I know you were on my side  
Even when I was wrong  
And I love you for giving me your eyes  
Staying back and watching me shine

Oh, but life goes on  
Oh, I'm just a girl

Got the radio on, my old blue jeans  
And I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve  
Feeling lucky today, got the sunshine  
Could you tell me what more do I need?  
And tomorrow's just a mystery, oh yeah  
But that's okay

But I'm ready to fly  
  
I'm alone, on my own

Oh, but life goes on  
Oh, I'm alone, on my own

"I walked through the door with you, the air was cold  
But something about it felt like home somehow  
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house  
And you still got it in your drawer, even now  
  
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide eyed gaze  
We're singing in the car getting lost upstate  
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place  
And I can picture it after all these days  
  
And I know it's long gone  
And that magic's not here no more  
And I might be okay  
But I'm not fine at all  
  
'Cause there we are again, on that little town street  
You almost ran the red 'cause you were looking over me  
Wind in my hair, I was there, I remember it all too well  
  
Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red  
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin size bed  
Your mother's telling stories about you on the tee ball team  
You tell me about your past, thinking your future was me  
  
And I know it's long gone  
And there's nothing else I could do  
And I forget about you long enough  
To forget why I needed to  
  
'Cause there we are again, in the middle of the night  
We're dancing around the kitchen in the refrigerator light  
Down the stairs, I was there, I remember it all too well  
  
And maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much  
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up  
Running scared, I was there, I remember it all too well  
  
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise  
So casually cruel in the name of being honest  
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here  
'Cause I remember it all, all, all too well  
  
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it  
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it  
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own  
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone  
  
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week  
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me  
You can't get rid of it 'cause you remember it all too well, yeah  
  
'Cause there we are again, when I loved you so  
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known  
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well  
  
Wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all  
Down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all  
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all to well

"I'm so glad you made time to see me.  
How's life, tell me how's your family?  
I haven't seen them in a while.  
You've been good, busier then ever.  
We small talk, work and the weather  
Your guard is up and I know why.  
  
Because the last time you saw me  
Is still burned in the back of your mind.  
You gave me roses and I left them there to die.  
  
So this is me swallowing my pride,  
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night.  
And I go back to December all the time.  
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you,  
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine.  
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right.  
I go back to December all the time.  
  
These days I haven't been sleeping  
Staying up playing back myself leaving,  
When your birthday passed and I didn't call.  
And I think about summer, all the beautiful times  
I watched you laughing from the passenger side  
And realized I'd loved you in the fall.  
And then the cold came, the dark days when fear crept into my mind.  
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye.  
  
So this is me swallowing my pride,  
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night.  
And I go back to December all the time.  
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you,  
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine.  
I'd go back to December turn around and change my own mind.  
I go back to December all the time  
  
I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile, so good to me, so right,  
And how you held me in your arms that September night,  
The first time you ever saw me cry.  
Maybe this is wishful thinking,  
Probably mindless dreaming  
But if we loved again I swear I'd love you right.  
  
I'd go back in time and change it but I can't  
So if the chain is on your door, I understand.  
  
But this is me swallowing my pride,  
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night,  
And I go back to December.  
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you,  
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine.  
I'd go back to December turn around and make it all right.  
I'd go back to December turn around and change my own mind.

"There's somethin' bout the way  
The street looks when it's just rained  
There's a glow off the pavement  
Walk me to the car  
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there  
In the middle of the parking lot  
Yeah  
  
We're drivin' down the road  
I wonder if you know  
I'm tryin' so hard not to get caught up now  
But you're just so cool  
Run your hands through your hair  
Absent mindedly makin' me want you  
  
[Chorus]  
And I don't know how it gets better than this  
You take my hand and drag me head first  
Fearless  
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance  
In a storm in my best dress  
Fearless  
  
So baby drive slow  
Til we run out of road in this one horse town  
I wanna stay right here in this passenger's seat  
You put your eyes on me  
In this moment now capture it remember it  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well you stood there with me in the doorway  
my hands shake  
I'm not usually this way but  
You pull me in and I'm a little more brave  
It's the first kiss, it's flawless, really something, it's fearless.

It could stay this simple  
I won't let nobody hurt you  
Won't let no one break your heart  
And even though you want to  
Please try to never grow up  
Don't you ever grow up  
Just never grow up

"(Spoken):  
My name's Taylor Swift  
This is a cover song I'm gonna sing for you  
By one of my favorite bands called Better Than Ezra  
And its the song called Our Last Night  
We were standing in an empty room  
The moonlight was falling  
You were holding my hand when the car pulled up for you  
And I could have spent a life with you  
But those days were over  
You were calling my name when your face faded from view  
And wasn't it you who told me the sun would always chase the day  
And wasn't it you who told me:  
Angels fly in the air tonight  
Saying wasn't it just like swimming out on the lake?  
And stars collide and the air's alive  
Or was it just like those promises that you made  
On our last night?  
I remember waking up with you  
The days doing nothing  
You meant more to me then than I think you ever knew.  
But you were gonna be a doctor, movie star  
A poet at a Nobel seminar  
I hope the world never tore that out of you  
Cause wasn't it you who told me the sun would always chase the day  
Yeah wasn't it you who told me:  
Angels fly in the air tonight  
Saying wasn't it just like swimming out on the lake?  
And stars collide and the air's alive  
Or was it just like those promises that you made  
On our last night?  
And what ever happened to the things you loved  
And the songs we played, and the indian days  
Whatever happened to the things you gave away?  
Like Harold and Maude and singing  
I was waving as you drove away  
The sunlight was falling  
You were writing backwards in a dusty window pane  
Angels fly in the air tonight  
And wasn't it just like swimming out on the lake?  
Oh oh yeah  
And stars collide and the air's alive  
Or was it just like those promises that you made  
On our last night?  
On our last night  
Oh oh oh oh oh

"I was riding shotgun with my hair undone in the front seat of his car  
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel  
The other on my heart  
I look around, turn the radio down  
He says, ""Baby, is something wrong?""  
I say, ""Nothin', I was just thinkin' how we don't have a song""  
And he said,  
  
Our song is a slamming screen door  
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window  
When we're on the phone, and you talk real slow  
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know  
Our song is the way you laugh, on the first date  
Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have  
And when I got home, before I said amen  
Asking God if he could play it again  
  
I was walking up the front porch steps after everything that day  
Had gone all wrong and been trampled on  
And lost and thrown away  
Got to the hallway, well on my way to my lovin' bed  
I almost didn't notice all the roses  
And the note that said,  
  
Our song is a slamming screen door  
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window  
When we're on the phone, and you talk real slow  
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know  
Our song is the way you laugh, on the first date  
Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have  
And when I got home, before I said amen  
Asking God if he could play it again  
  
I've heard every album, listened to the radio  
Waited for something to come along  
That was as good as our song  
  
'Cause our song is a slamming screen door  
Sneaking out late, tapping on his window  
When we're on the phone, and he talks real slow  
'Cause it's late, and his mama don't know  
Our song is the way he laughs, on the first date

Play it again, oh yeah, oh, oh, yeah

"Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street  
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin ending so suddenly  
Loving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying
through the free fall  
Like the colors in autumn, so bright just before they lose it all  
  
Losing him was blue like I'd never known  
Missing him was dark grey all alone  
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met  
But loving him was red  
Loving him was red  
  
Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front
of you  
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song  
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's
no right answer  
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that
strong  
  
Losing him was blue like I'd never known  
Missing him was dark gray all alone  
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met  
But loving him was red  
Oh red  
Burning red  
  
Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes  
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go  
But moving on from him is impossible  
When I still see it all in my head  
Burning red  
Burning it was red  
  
Oh losing him was blue like I'd never known  
Missing him was dark gray all alone  
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met  
'Cause loving him was red  
Yeah, yeah red  
We're burning red  
  
And that's why he's spinning 'round in my head  
Comes back to me, burning red  
Yeah, yeah  
His love was like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street

"I remember your bare feet down the hallway  
I remember your little laugh  
Race cars on the kitchen floor  
Plastic dinosaurs, I love you to the moon and back  
  
I remember your blue eyes looking into mine like we had our own secret club  
I remember you dancing before bed time then jumping on me waking me up  
I can still feel you hold my hand  
Little man, from even that moment I knew  
You fought it hard like an army guy  
Remember I leaned in and whispered to you  
  
Come on baby with me  
We're gonna fly away from here  
You were my best four years  
  
I remember the drive home when the blind hope  
Turned to crying and screaming, ""Why?""  
Flowers piled up in the worst way  
No one knows what to say about a beautiful boy who died  
  
And it's about to be Halloween  
You could be anything you wanted if you were still here  
  
I remember the last day when I kissed your face  
I whispered in your ear  
  
Come on baby with me  
We're gonna fly away from here  
Out of this curtained room in this hospital  
We'll just disappear  
Come on baby with me  
We're gonna fly away from here  
You were my best four years  
  
What if I'm standing in your closet trying to talk to you?  
What if I kept the hand me downs you won't grow into?  
And what if I really thought some miracle would see us through?  
But what if the miracle was even getting one moment with you  
  
Come on baby with me  
We're gonna fly away from here  
Come on baby with me  
We're gonna fly away from here  
You were my best four years

I love you to the moon and back

"New to town with a made up name in the angel city, chasing fortune and fame  
And the camera flashes, make it look like a dream  
You had it figured out since you were in school  
Everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool  
So over night, you look like a sixties queen

And they tell you that you're lucky but you're so confused  
'Cause you don't feel pretty, you just feel used  
And all the young things line up to take your place  
Another name goes up in lights  
You wonder if you'll make it out alive

Chose the rose garden over Madison Square

"You should've been there,  
Should've burst through the door,  
With that 'baby I'm right here' smile,  
And it would've felt like,  
A million little shining stars had just aligned,  
And I would've been so happy.  
  
Christmas lights glisten,  
I've got my eye on the door,  
Just waiting for you to walk in,  
But the time is ticking,  
People ask me how I've been  
As I comb back through my memory,  
How you said you'd be here,  
You said you'd be here.  
  
And it was like slow motion,  
Standing there in my party dress,  
In red lipstick,  
With no one to impress,  
And they're all laughing,  
As I'm looking around the room,  
But there was one thing missing,  
And that was the moment I knew.  
  
And the hours pass by,  
Now I just wanna be alone,  
But your close friends always seem to know  
When there's something really wrong,  
So they follow me down the hall,  
And there in the bathroom,  
I try not to fall apart,  
And the sinking feeling starts,  
As I say hopelessly,  
""He said he'd be here.""  
  
And it was like slow motion,  
Standing there in my party dress,  
In red lipstick,  
With no one to impress,  
And they're all laughing,  
And asking me about you,  
But there was one thing missing,  
And that was the moment I knew.  
  
What do you say  
When tears are streaming down your face  
In front of everyone you know?  
And what do you do when the one  
Who means the most to you  
Is the one who didn't show?  
  
You should've been here.  
And I would've been so happy.  
  
And it was like slow motion,  
Standing there in my party dress,  
In red lipstick,  
With no one to impress,  
And they're all standing around me singing  
""Happy birthday to you"",  
But there was one thing missing,  
And that was the moment I knew.  
  
Ooh, I knew.  
Ooh,

And said, ""I'm sorry, I didn't make it,""  
And I said, ""I'm sorry too,""

Ignoring words that you were saying  
Trying to make me stay

And you've called a hundred times

'Cause I'm so mad I might tell you that it's over  
But if you look a little closer  
  
I said leave but all I really want is you  
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles  
Screaming, 'I'm in love with you'  
Wait there in the pouring rain, coming back for more  
And don't you leave cause I know  
All I need is on the other side of the door

Going through the photographs  
Staring at the phone  
I keep going back over, things we both said  
And I remember the slamming door  
And all the things that I misread  
So babe if you know everything  
Tell me why you couldn't see  
That when I left I wanted you to chase after me  
  
Yeah, I said leave but all I really want is you

After everything I must confess, I need you

We stood eye to eye and toe to toe  
When I told him that he wasn't gonna come back home  
He raised his fist to me, but I didn't flinch  
I said, ""I ain't your son, you son of a bitch.""  
  
I might have had a knife in my back pocket  
I might have pulled it out before he saw it  
That's all between the river and me  
I might have had a gun, but I didn't fire it  
He might have tried to yell, but I kept him quiet  
That's all between the river and me  
That's all between the river and me  
  
Sheriff came knocking on our front door  
They said they found his body by the reservoir  
Bottle in his shirt and liquor in his blood  
He must have fallen in the river and he never came up  
  
There might have been blood, but they never saw it  
Just a little mud on the living room carpet  
That's all between the river and me  
Well, after what he done, there ain't no wonder  
I can't remember how long I held him under  
That's all between the river and me  
That's all between the river and me

"I am just a blank sheet of paper

To tell you that he's sorry for the way he did you wrong  
To ask for your forgiveness for leaving you alone  
He's been looking down at me, seems like forever  
Takes the top on and off his pen  
It's like he can't decide just what he wants to say  
If he'd just tell the truth, I'd be on my way

Was the only sound 'til momma laid down, a book she found upstairs  
It was covered in dust in the back of the closet,  
Goodwill box we almost tossed it out  
We could have lost all those memories

Ticket stubs to a Braves game  
Silver star and a baggage claim from Hanoi, Vietnam

All the Polaroids are just reminders,  
You can't hold life in a three ring binder

There's a picture at his sister taken in July  
On the steps of the church pulling out his tie  
Hair's still wet from gettin' baptized, the brand new blue suit on  
An old set of keys to his Chevrolet  
A crumpled up receipt for a wedding ring  
We watched ourselves grow up there in his arms  
In the book of John  
  
That sun came up, we were wide awake  
Head to toe in black and gray  
Long black Lincoln waiting down the drive  
He was father, son, husband and friend  
I still flip through it every now and then  
When I need just a few words of advice  
It's almost like he's not really gone

She tipped the D.J. to play her favorite song

And the music from his radio is like freedom down a dirt toad  
Makes that eight by ten a brighter hill

Five seconds since he's missed her

And all his buddies, they begged him not to drive  
Mr. Life of the Party, he's now number 37405

He took a life and that's a fact, he'd give his own to give it back  
Today's the day he finally gets parole  
  
He turns in them prison clothes, and stands there at the forkin' road  
And mama prays and waits while he decides  
And the angels close their eyes  
  
Listens to the birds sing on a perfect autumn morning  
Just down the road, rings an old church bell

Made a promise I'd take you to homecoming,  
But Annie I didn't keep it.  
Almost called you up, when I played it bolder,

And there's a song on the radio.  
You give me your hand and we start to dance,  
The cashier gives us a smile.  
As you turn and walk away, I hear your little girl say

Gave me a second chance.

He would fight every night  
If he didn't get his way  
She was kind she could find  
All the good in everyone  
And then one day she passed his way  
He felt reborn in that morning sun  
He saw her face she caught his name

He knew he'd never be the same

Look deep inside the eyes of a woman

Out of rope little hope  
I never get back on my feet

One look at her and I'm a brand new man

With just one look I found my salvation

Our feet in the water, she'd press her lips to mine

She could be honeymoon sweet and a little wild

It matters, but didn't back then

He was different he wasn't cool like me  
Sticks and stones didn't break any bones

And in his eyes I heard him say

You'll sit down by yourself and think  
About the times you pushed and shoved me

I left her standin' there with my high school ring  
Innocent tears in the pourin' rain  
As I walked away  
And I still see her in my dreams  
And to this day she's whispering  
  
""One of these days you're gonna love me

The pages start to turn  
Then suddenly I'm singin'  
The moment that I learn  
  
One of these days I'm gonna love me  
And feel the joy of sweet release  
One of these days, I'll rise above me  
And at last I'll find some peace

"Blue jean baby, L.A. lady  
She was the seamstress for the band  
Pretty eyed, pirate smile  
She'll marry a music man  
Ballerina, you must have seen  
Her dancing in the sand  
And now she's in me  
Always with me, tiny dancer in my hand  
  
Jesus freaks out in the street  
Handing tickets out for God  
Turning back she just laughs  
The boulevard is not that bad  
  
Piano man he makes his stand  
In the auditorium  
Looking on she sings the songs  
The words she knows, the tune she hums  
  
But oh how it feels so real  
Lying here with no one near  
Only you and you can hear me  
When I say softly, slowly

Hold me closer tiny dancer  
Count the headlights on the highway  
Lay me down in sheets of linen  
You had a busy day today

"In the fights they had he'd cover up his ears  
Thought big boys don't cry, fight back all the tears  
Mamma'd use her makeup to hide the bruises on her face  
In the morning they'd pretend that there'd never ever been a trace  
His old man woke him up to help him find the car  
Take the bus uptown outside some run down bar  
He swore that he was quitting, and then he'd start to cry  
And though the boy knew the truth, sometimes he'd still believe that lie  
  
The sins of the father are the sins of the son  
All you do is crawl when you want to run  
God gave boys their mammas  
'Cause they always see their promise  
And they help them understand  
How to walk like man  
Walk like a man  
  
They moved a lot of places, they never settled down  
And it got pretty old being the new kid in town  
He'd always tell his friends, ""My daddy's sick today""  
Said he's be rich if he had a nickel every time he heard his momma say:  
  
The sins of the father are the sins of the son  
Crawl before you walk boy, walk before you run  
Come on stand up straight, I'm proud of you, take my hand  
I know you can

Walk like a man

Don't you listen to you 'em cause they got no claim  
Temptations may come that ain't no sin  
You get stronger every time that you don't give in  
  
The sins of the father are the sins of son

Isn't it amazing

I'll be your partner  
And never leave your side

"Long, long ago  
In a world dark and cold  
Night so still, winter's chill  
One bright star was shining  
On a bed made of hay  
In a manger He lay  
The shepherds came, they knew His name  
King of Kings, a brand new day  
They saw the light in the darkness  
It shines on us in tenderness  
It brings out the hope that's in all of us  
May it shine it's light on you this Christmas Night  
On this Christmas day  
May that star light your way  
This Christmas Eve, I still believe  
That same star still shines on me  
They saw the light in the darkness  
It shines on us in tenderness  
It brings out the hope that's in all of us  
May it shine it's light on you this Christmas Night  
May it shine it's light on you this Christmas Night

What if one of those sweet kids was your very own  
Tonight those kids are weeping while yours are safely sleeping

"Have you ever been down to Haiti, when  
The summer sun was sinkin' low  
There's nothin' but romance, just everywhere you glance  
And the native hearts are all a-glow  
But when the Cuban Queen comes upon the scene  
They all stare like a statue out of stone  
And when they realize what's before their eyes  
The other girls are left all alone.  
  
Down in the Caribbean, it's not a dream you're seein'  
When you get a glimpse of the lady with the charm  
But from miles away you can see her sway  
To the beat of the Cuban Conga line that forms.  
  
Up in a tree so high, way up in the sky  
Sits a wide-eyed monkey on a limb  
He wonders why the people go to so much trouble  
Just to try to be like him  
He doesn't understand, that it's a lady's hand  
That makes a heart feel so sublime  
But before too long, he starts singing the song  
And then he gets in the Conga line.  
  
Columbus searched for spices, but he missed the nicest  
Part of the Caribbean  
He didn't see the charms and the open arms  
It was the gold that he was seein'  
Oh, but I'm glad he missed, the sweetest thing I've kissed

And so my heart is paying now for things I didn't do  
In anger unkind words are said that make the teardrops start

Illinois central Monday morning rail  
Fifteen cars and fifteen restless riders  
Three conductors and twenty-five sacks of mail  
All along the southbound odyssey  
The train pulls out at Kankakee  
Rolls along past houses, farms and fields  
Passin' trains that have no names  
Freight yards full of old black men  
And the graveyards of the rusted automobiles

How are you?  
Don't you know me? I'm your native son

Pass the paper bag that holds the bottle  
Feel the wheels rumblin' 'neath the floor  
  
And the sons of Pullman Porters

Ride their father's magic carpets made of steel  
Mothers with their babes asleep  
Are rockin' to the gentle beat

"Cowboys Are Frequently Secretly (Fond of Each Other)  
Well, there's many a strange impulse out on the plains of West Texas.  
There's many a young boy who feels things he can't comprehend.  
And a small town don't like it when somebody falls between sexes.  
No, a small town don't like it when a cowboy has feelings for men.  
And I believe to my soul that inside every man there's the feminine.  
And inside every lady there's a deep manly voice loud and clear.  
Well, a cowboy may brag about things that he's done with his women.  
But the ones who brag loudest are the ones that are most likely queer.  
Cowboys are frequently secretly fond of each other.  
Say, what do you think all them saddles and boots was about?  
And there's many a cowboy who don't understand the way that he feels for his
brother.  
And inside every cowboy there's a lady that'd love to slip out.  
And there's always somebody who says what the others just whisper.  
And mostly that someone's the first one to get shot down dead.  
So when you talk to a cowboy don't treat him like he was a sister.  
You can't fuck with a lady that's sleepin' in each cowboy's head.

As I watch the mating of a dove,  
And it was in the springtime that we said goodbye.  
I remember our faded love.

I can hear my mother softly singing rock of ages Rock of ages cleft for me  
  
Now this old world of ours is full of trouble  
This old world would also better be

He was made of snow but the children know how he came to life one day

Running here and there all around the square saying catch me if you can  
  
He led them down the streets of town right to the traffic cop  
And he only paused a moment when he heard him holler stop  
Frosty the snowman had to hurry on his way

How long is forever this time  
How long until one night you don't come home again  
How long is forever this time how long until I'm all alone again  
  
People say I'm foolish when I take you back  
And it could be they're right but who can say  
You'll be welcome here within my arms forever  
Even when forever ends for me today  
How long is forever this time...
