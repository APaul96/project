And make a living out of playing pool.  
Or find myself a rock 'n' roll band  
That needs a helping hand.

Blew it all away

with the horrors  
Says lord give me time for I've jumped into space

From the plaque that says his name  
Walking to my girlfriend's car  
Came back down on me  
Yeah, I guess I fell to my knees  
To keep from falling face-first into the dream  
The vision that had had me twisting out under the afternoon sky  
I didn't know it then  
But it was thirteen years to the day he died  
  
He held his hand in me  
Like brothers we walked  
Through the colorless world of an alcohol dream  
I talked for hours  
Trying the break through the silence  
That he held over me  
Then he started away, turned his head  
Keep it up so you can die like me  
  
Ever since my brother odied  
I've drifted all over from town to town to town  
Every place I go it's always the same  
I keep doing junk, I keep going down  
My mama got religion and my sisters gave up  
Man I just gave up too  
I just died inside  
Don't wanna die like george  
Everybody says there's things to see  
Everybody's pointing their fingers at me  
  
I woke up driving  
After another blackout from another bad drug  
I can't shake this hell that I made for myself  
For every other life I took  
See my sister's son walk the line I walked  
He's only sixteen  
If he don't learn from my mistakes  
He's gonna waste away  
He's gonna die like me

Lived in the apartment above me  
We smoked cigarettes on the stairs  
Tell me stories that white boys never hear  
  
Like when he found this shine  
He moved north in nineteen forty-nine  
On his tenth birthday daddy took him to town  
To see the Jackie Robinson play.  
  
It was a picture perfect day  
In the sunshine and the hate  
He didn't understand why all those  
People would say such awful things.  
  
His daddy said pay no attention to them  
Turnaround and watch the man play  
  
The one black man in the baseball field  
Was better in every way  
My daddy said if you wanna win in this world  
You gotta beat 'em the their own game.  
  
Luther Jackson Green  
Went to law school in nineteen sixty-three  
In the summer between he worked in Alabama  
With Martin Luther King  
  
He met a girl on a summer night  
He fell hard when they saw each other's eyes  
There were people in town that really didn't  
Like that he was black and she was white  
  
They found her in the ditch  
A little outside of town  
Some stupid man was blastin' about it  
So Luther beat him down  
  
He looked him in the eye, spit in his face and  
He turned and walked away.  
He knew he was better than all the hate  
He knew he was bigger than all the pain  
He knew there's a time to fight and a time to walk away  
He knew until he changed the rules  
Ooh yeah they beat 'em at their own game.  
  
He never did lose that feeling inside  
You could hear it in his voice  
You could see it in his eyes  
  
Luther moved out West to live  
When his wife passed away  
He lives right next door to his son  
So he can watch his grandchild play.  
  
Luther Jackson Green  
Watched election night with me.  
We put a black man in the White House  
A thing he never thought he'd see.  
  
Even though he never cried  
I could see tears in his eyes  
He had dreamed about this moment  
Every single day of his life.  
  
Yeah Luther died that night in his sleep  
But he lived long enough to see,  
America become the kind of place  
He always wanted it to be.  
  
He said you could never forget the day  
That we beat 'em at their own game!  
  
Yeah just like Jackie Robinson (just like Jackie Robinson)  
Gotta be bigger than all the hate (just like Jackie Robinson)  
Gotta be better than all the pain (just like Jackie Robinson)

Santa baby, now hurry down the chimney tonight  
  
Think of all the fun I've missed  
Think of all the girlies that I could've kissed  
Next year I could be just as good  
If you'd check off my christmas list  
Santa baby, forgot to mention just one little thing, a ring  
I don't mean on the phone  
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight

"I am still living with your ghost  
Lonely and dreaming of the west coast  
I don't want to be your downtime  
I don't want to be your stupid game  
  
With my big black boots and an old suitcase  
I do believe I'll find myself a new place  
I don't want to be the bad guy  
I don't want do your sleepwalk dance anymore  
I just want to see some palm trees  
I will try and shake away this disease

We can live beside the ocean  
Leave the fire behind  
Swim out past the breakers  
Watch the world die  
  
I am still dreaming of you face  
Hungry and hollow for all the things you took away  
I don't want to be your good time  
I don't want to be your fall-back crutch anymore  
  
I'll walk right out into a brand new day  
Insane and rising in my own weird way  
I don't want to be the bad guy  
I don't want to do your sleepwalk dance anymore  
  
I just want to feel some sunshine  
I just want to find some place to be alone

Not because I look like Tyson Beckford

But what she sees  
Are my faults and indecisions  
My insecure conditions  
And the tears upon the pillow that I she'd  
She don't care about my big screen

Things like that just never mattered much to her  
Plus she don't watch to much T. V.

Not because I sing like Pavarotti  
Or because I am such a hottie  
I like her for her  
Not because she's phat like Cindy Crawford  
She has got so much to offer  
Why does she waste all her time with me  
There must be something there that I don't see  
She likes me for me  
Not because I'm tough like Dirty Hairy  
Make her laugh just like Jim Carrey  
Unlike the Cable Guy  
But what she sees  
Is that I can't live without her  
My arms belong around her  
And I'm so glad I found her once again  
Found her once again  
I'm so glad I found her once again

Didn't start until  
We left on our honeymoon  
  
We stepped off the plane  
Into a warm sunny day

Together  
  
The sun shines down

Our wedding day  
Was warm and sunny  
Our friends and family  
Came from out of town  
  
We said I do  
Then ate some food  
And smiled  
Until the sun went down  
  
We'll take the Zodiac Cadillac  
Around the north shore  
Then we'll head back  
The sea turtles come to greet us  
  
So let's get loaded tonight  
We'll drink on the flight  
Back home

Paint the stars in the sky

Open up the big windows and throw a chain on the double locked door  
Open up to the flame

Blowing big through the trees in my backyard  
I sit alone in a dark room smoking  
And wondering where you are  
You went away when the truth came down  
The sex was not enough for you to make you want to stick around  
You said that I made you feel weak  
I made you feel like you couldn't do anything  
I try to sing myself to sleep to the rythym of the sound of the boulevard cars  
I lay awake with my eyes wide open underneath the western stars  
Hard promises broken that should have never been made

I was warm in the shame

"Lyrics for Hunger For Power  
Performed by Incubus  
Rational human beings irrational in other ways  
Betraying each other in an unfriendly race  
All they do is think for themselves  
Ask them for some help and they'll tell you to go to Hell  
Welcome to the brutal world  
Vehemence, the way it goes  
Rejoicing for the disgrace of the successful one  
The jealousy is the weapon of the incompetent bum  
So if you think you've got your best frined  
You better look back, you never know what he might do next  
The anger is built in silence  
It's gonna cause some ignorant violence  
That's a goal rule number one  
To achieve in command  
What they've done in the past  
You're gonna let'em pay back  
I wonder why you do to others  
What you don't want them doing to you  
If prejudice has a value in life  
Evil would rule you too  
Remember for all the bad things you commit  
You're gonna pay with the same coin, you damn fool  
Breaking the barrier between patience and rage  
That are controlling you  
Now you're feeling what your best friend was going through  
That's the way the circle of life  
Has been for many years ago people are so greedy  
When they're in trouble, they look for you  
You can't lose this society battle  
Evil plans are coming to your mind  
To fight back, a sabotage  
That has happened many times  
CHORUS  
Hunger for power  
When you die  
All you have  
Won't go with you  
Hunger for power  
Stupid fight  
You better stand straight  
Or you might fall  
CHORUS

Is a gift I didn't think could be real  
  
To know that you feel the same as I do

So would I be out of line if I said  
I miss you?  
  
I see your picture  
I smell your skin on the empty pillow next to mine  
  
You have only been gone ten days

What's the use of autonomy  
When a button does it all?

This quirk in evolution will begin

Let you see past the feathers and flocks,

Every foolish dream  
And every compromise  
Every word you spoke

Everything you left me, rambles in my head

And everything you loved

Everybody cry

The stars can't for your sign  
Don't signal now

"Looking out my window  
An angel in robes appeared and nearly pulled me apart  
A million miles of freedom, a million miles of road,  
But I still don't know where to start  
  
She wrote her number down  
And she gave it to me  
They had to scrape me off the floor  
In this transient town, waiters and dealers  
Trying to get their foot in the door  
  
That night I called her and she said  
""Daddy daddy daddy, all my life  
I've been trying to find my place in the world""  
And I said to her  
""Baby baby babe, I got all night to listen to the heart of a girl""  
  
I can see the time drippin' down the clock,  
We've been trying to hear that ancient refrain  
It's the one that knows just when our heads are down  
And reminds us of the place from where we came  
Where we came  
  
""Daddy daddy daddy, all my life  
I've been trying to find my place in this world""  
""Baby baby babe, I got all night to listen to the heart of a girl""  
  
What happened here, what is this world?  
It's too far from the heart of a girl  
A ripple in the water  
From the drop of a pearl  
I'm on the shore waitin'  
For the heart of a girl  
  
Many doors, knock on one  
Standin' still, time is raging  
Staring down the mouth of a hundred thousand guns  
And you're still here, you're still here  
  
I believe that we never have to be alone  
Yes I believe it's just around the bend  
You can hold it in  
Or you can scream it on a microphone  
There is no end (there is no end)  
There is no end (there is no end)  
  
And, deep in the night, I feel the presence  
Of something that was long ago told to me  
There is a hand, guiding the river  
The river to wide open sea  
And deep in my heart, in and again  
On any mountain, no I'm not afraid  
Standing on stone, you stand beside me  
And honor the plans that were made

"Wheels are turning  
I remember when you were mine  
Now just to reach you  
Baby, I'd stand in line  
  
But there's another world  
We're living in  
Tonight  
  
And there's another heart  
That's fading in  
The light  
  
Don't want your picture  
On my cell phone  
I want you here with me  
Don't want your memory  
In my head now  
I want you here with me  
  
Spent the summer, just laying out in the sun  
Time seems to move so slow  
When you're taking it as it comes  
Maybe we were just too young  
  
Your body was tanned and your hair was long  
You showed me your smile and my cares were gone  
Falling in love filled my soul with fright  
You said ""Come on babe, it'll be alright""  
I must have been a fool to the bitter end  
Now I hold on to hope to have you back again  
I'd bargain and I'd fight  
  
But there's another world  
We're living in  
Tonight  
  
Don't want your picture  
On my cell phone  
I want you here with me  
I don't want your memory  
In my head now  
I want you here with me  
  
Well I saw you in a restaurant  
The other day  
And instead of walking towards you  
I ran away  
And I'll keep on waiting for you  
Till you'll come around  
Come around and say  
  
Don't want your picture  
On my cell phone  
I want you here with me  
Don't need those memories  
In my head now  
I want you here with me

In an army's strength therein  
Lies the denouement. From  
Here you're haunting me. By  
The Seine so beautiful, only  
Not to be of use, impossible.  
So strange, victory, 1200 spires  
The only sound, moscow burning.  
Empty like the Tuileries. Like a dream  
Vienna seems, only not to be of use- impossible.  
In the last extremity, to  
Advance or not to advance, I  
Hear you laughing  
Even still you're calling me

Not tonight""

Someone now thinks Caton wrote them all

So today, the smurfs again  
How can they be so blue, so short, so sweet  
Smurf, you're like me we're three apples tall at least

I don't know I don't know I don't know  
  
But maybe that's the new concept  
Where the smurfs are like the bees in the garden now  
They live in mushrooms, the new sin symbols  
And where the smurfette's forced to sell her  
But how  
Said how  
  
They forced you to submit your soul  
Poor lady in blue she sings

The smurfette is the Mary Magdalene  
Gargamel is the Bush America  
And if you ask me why  
I don't know I don't know I don't know  
  
And so in my new concept  
The smurfette is risen as feminine  
The smurfs are the archetype  
Of what societies could be  
And I'd like to live in mushrooms  
I'll come with you little silly smurfs

He courts the lightning flash and her  
  
Summoning the spirits  
Through incantations  
You said the Thunder God seems to have  
And our enemies are the Reed  
But we knew the Furies held the Holly sacred  
  
We were insulated  
In a circle of words we'd drawn  
With wisdom sent from nine Hazels  
A Rowan fire and a Willow rod  
  
At ten comes the vine  
That generates bramble wine  
The constant change of the night sun  
A song in the blood of the white bull  
  
Our language of love  
The Battle of Trees  
We fought side by side  
No one had more  
  
Sharper consonants than you, love  
And my vowels, well, were trusted  
  
From Ivy leaves is an ale that can unveil  
The hidden meanings and serpents  
Only revealed through visions  
Yes vowels could insert  
""A"" was for the Silver Fir  
  
The Firs of course  
Then came next  
With Heather at her most  
Passionate  
  
The White Poplar's gift to the souls of the dead  
A promise that it was not the end  
But for the vine the ""U"", its coffer  
  
Vowels and consonants  
The power of trees  
The power they hold  
The power of prose  
  
So when the church  
Began to twist the old myths  
They built their own Tower of Babel  
From Ulster to Munster  
  
The Reed gave way then  
To the Elder  
The Earth turns her will  
So that night follows day  
  
From dawn to dawn  
From Winter to Winter  
At day the Ash had power over the Alder  
  
Our language of love  
The Battle of Trees  
We fought side by side  
Then he said to me:  
""I've dodged bullets and even poisoned arrows  
Only to be foiled by the blade of a vowel""

Does it bother anyone else,  
That someone else has your name?

Moving forward, torn  
In to pieces over reasons.  
Of what these storms are for,  
I don't understand why everything that I adore  
Takes a different form when I squint my eyes.  
Have you done that?  
When you squint your eyes,  
And your eyelashes make it look like not right  
And then when just enough light  
Comes from just the right side  
And you find you're not who you're supposed to be?  
This is not what you're supposed to see,  
Please, remember me. I am supposed to be.  
King of a kingdom. or swinging on a swing.  
Something happened to my imagination  
This situation's becoming dire.  
My tree house is on fire  
And for some reason I smell gas on my hands.  
This is not what I had planned,  
This is not what I had planned.

"Now is the climax to the story  
That gives the demons and angels purpose  
They fly around while we are walking  
And mold our emotions just to please them  
I am cold, can you hear  
I will fly, with no hope, no fear  
And the ground, taunts my wings  
Plummet as I sing, plummet as I sing  
All we are is an isle of flightless birds  
We find our worth in giving birth and stuff  
We're lining our homes against winding roads  
And we think the going is tough  
We pick songs to sing, remind us of things that no body cares about  
And honestly we're probably more suicidal than ever now  
If you decide to live by, what you think's wrong and what's right  
Believe me you'll begin to wish you were sleeping  
Your weeping will creep in head and you'll cry  
But if we wake up every morning and decide what we believe  
We can take a part our very heart and the light will set you free  
I am cold, can you hear  
I will fly, with no hope, no fear  
And the ground, taunts my wings  
Plummet as I sing, plummet as I sing  
How frustrating, and so degrading  
His time, we're wasting  
And time will fly by and the sky will cry as light is fading  
And he is waiting, oh so patiently  
While we repeat the same routine as we will please comfortability  
Please think about why you can't sleep in the evening  
And please don't be afraid of what your soul is really thinking  
Your soul knows good and evil, your soul knows both sides  
And it's time you pick your battle, and I promise you this is mine

And then try to come up with a narcistic way to say  
They don't know you  
And neither do I, so  
Here's a prime example of a standup guy, who  
Hates what he believes and loves it at the same time  
Here's my brother and his head, screwed up, but that's alright

I'm winning a momentary sinning a moment passing after

Pretending enemies are friend of me, sending me straight to bending me  
My bad behavior but I bet I could have been a better man  
Copy and paste caught me, and copy, better rhymes bother me  
The better the rhythm the badder I am but I bet I'll battle with 'em battle  
Better I am, Gambling man, better bet I am a gambling man, I am?

And my pain will range from up, down, and sideways.  
Thank God it's Friday cause Fridays will always be better than Sundays  
'Cause Sundays are my suicide days.  
  
I don't know why they always seem so dismal.  
Thunderstorms, clouds, snow and a slight drizzle.  
Whether it's the weather or the letters by my bed  
Sometimes death seems better than the migraine in my head.  
Let it be said what the headache represents  
It's me defending in suspense  
It's me suspended in a defenseless test  
Being tested by a ruthless examiner  
That's represented best by my depressing thoughts.  
I do not have writer's block my writer just hates the clock.  
It will not let me sleep I guess I'll sleep when I'm dead

I am not as fine as I seem.  
Pardon, me for yelling and telling you green gardens  
Are not what's growing in my psyche, it's a different me  
A difficult beast feasting on burnt down trees.  
Freeze frame, please let me paint a mental picture portrait.  
Something you won't forget, it's all about my forehead  
And how it is a door that hold's back contents  
That makes Pandora's box contents look non-violent.  
Behind my eyelids are islands of violence  
My mind ship-wrecked this is the only land my mind could find  
I did not know it was such a violent island  
Full of tidal waves, suicidal crazed lions.  
They're trying to eat me, blood running down their chin  
And I know that I can fight, or I can let the lion win.  
I begin to assemble what weapons I can find  
'Cause sometimes to stay alive you gotta kill your mind.

Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat.  
Shadows will scream that I'm alone.  
But I know, we've made it this far, kid.

From all the pain our brain has made, the game is not played alone.  
And I will say that we should take a moment and hold it  
And keep it frozen and know that life has a hopeful undertone.

Why it's got to be like this, is this living free,

Why won't you let me go?  
Do I threaten all your plans, I'm insignificant,  
Please tell them you have no plans for me,

As the trees they await and clouds anticipate,  
The start of a day when we put on our face,  
A mask that portrays that we don't need grace,  
On the eve of a day that is bigger than us,  
But we open our eyes 'cause we're told that we must,  
And the trees wave their arms and the clouds try to plead,  
Desperately yelling there's something we need,  
I'm not free I asked forgiveness three times,  
Same amount that I denied, I three-time mvp'ed this crime,  
I'm afraid to tell you who I adore, won't tell you what I'm sing towards,  
Metaphorically I'm a whore, and that's denial number four.

"Where'd you go, huh?  
They all think I know you,  
Yeah, it's so hard to motivate me to devote  
A single inch of me to something I can't see,  
I don't mean to pry but why  
Would you even make the eyes?  
I don't believe my ears,  
And I'm scared of my own head,  
I will deny you for years and  
I'll make you raise me from the dead,  
And if I said that I would live for you for nothing in return,  
Well, I'm sorry Mr. Gullible,  
But lying's all I've learned,  
So be concerned (x2)  
  
No music,  
And I can talk about anything  
Whether or not it's worthwhile  
Is based on who's listening,  
Most of us listening for something we can relate to,  
All of us related for something we just been through,  
Taken for granted trust is damaged and now we panic,  
Livin empty-handed living lives like we can manage,  
I can feel you but still know where home is feeling like Jonah did,  
Almost dropped the bat like every base was fully loaded,  
So be concerned (x2)  
  
I am disappearing  
Inside my birds-eye theories,  
I try to say goodbye, defy and deny,  
What it is I'm fearing  
Clearly I am dying,  
Dearly I am writing,  
Merely testifying that a test to fly requires  
I pass the test with colors flying,  
I don't believe you most the time,  
I'm lying 'cause I say I am fine,  
You are the pearl, I am the swine,  
So break my life and take this rhyme,  
I'm so sorry but I do believe  
That all my bridges I have burned,  
And I've earned a policy of no return,  
So be concerned (x4)

"He wakes up early today,

In his bed, late at night he's petrified.

Why don't you invite them up?  
I got a word or two to tell them  
It's about the situation  
A terrible miscommunication  
It involves a child of mine  
Destined to side with the oppression

Let me speak to them  
But a bad wire burn the connection  
A man fix the problem  
It is the only solution

I see them birds in flight  
Take off in every direction  
A thinking man, a feeling man

Why don't you invite them up?

A chance at love attraction  
A chance to heal the nation

"Holy cow! I think I've got one here  
Now just what am I supposed to do?  
I've got a number of irrational fears  
That I'd like to share with you  
  
First, there's rules about old goats like me  
Hangin' 'round with chicks like you -but I do like you-  
And another one: you say ""like"" too much  
  
But I'm shaking at your touch  
I like you way too much  
My baby, I'm afraid I'm falling for you  
'N I'd do about anything to get the hell out alive  
Or maybe I would rather settle down with you  
  
Holy moly, baby, wouldn't you know it?  
Just as I was bustin' loose  
I gotta go turn in my rock star card  
And get fat and old with you  
'Cause I'm a burning a candle you're a gentle month  
Teaching me to lick a little bit kinder  
And I do like you - you're the lucky one  
No! I'm the lucky one  
  
Holy Sweet goddamn! You left your cello in the basement  
I admired the glowing the stars  
And tried to play a tune'  
  
I can't believe how bad I suck, it's true

"Gordon Lightfoot  
Sang a song  
About a boat  
That sank in the lake  
At the break  
Of the morning,  
A Cat named Stevens  
Found a faith  
He could believe in  
And Joan Baez  
I never listened  
To too much jazz,  
But hippie songs  
Could be heard  
In our pad  
Eddie Rabbitt sang  
About how much  
He loved a rainy night,  
Abba, Devo, Benatar  
Were there day  
John Lennon died,  
Mr. Springsteen said  
He had a hungry heart  
Grover Washington  
Was happy on the day  
He topped the charts  
These are the songs  
  
[Chorus]  
These are my heart songs  
They never feel wrong  
And when I wake  
For goodness sake  
These are the songs  
I keep singin'  
  
Quiet Riot got me started  
With the bangin' on my head  
Iron Maiden, Judas Priest  
And Slayer  
Taught me how to shred  
I gotta admit though  
Sometimes  
I would listen  
To the radio  
Debbie Gibson  
Tell me that you think  
We're all alone  
Michael Jackson's  
In the mirror  
I've gotta have faith  
If I wanna see clear  
Never gonna give you up  
Wish me love  
Or wishing well  
It takes two to make  
A thing go right  
If the Fresh Prince  
Starts a fight  
Don't you worry  
For too long  
'Cause you know  
These are the songs

Back in 1991  
I wasn't havin' any fun  
Till my roommate said  
""Come on and put  
A brand new record on""  
Had a baby on it  
He was naked on it  
Then I heard the chords  
That broke the chains  
I had upon me  
Got together with my bros  
In some rehearsal studios  
Then we played  
Our first rock show  
And watched the fan base  
Start to grow  
Signed the deal that gave  
The dough to make  
A record of our own  
The song come  
On the radio  
Now people go  
This is the song

Tellin' 'em stories of savage cannibals

At first I was sure I didn't exist to her  
I sulker around but I didn't know why

Just feel like you're the hardest button to button
