"The stakes are high  
We have to seize the chance  
A case of do or die  
This is our last dance  
  
A moment's hesitation and we always pay the price  
Hiding in the wings is just like walking on thin ice  
  
All our yesterdays will soon be ending  
Hide the walking shadow on the stage  
All our yesterdays be soon forgotten  
There's an easy way to turn the page  
  
The vision is too real  
The prize is there to take  
We're on an even keel  
No demons in our way  
  
If you stack the cards you will one day find your heaven  
Both sides of the dice are always adding up to seven  
  
All our yesterdays will soon be ending  
Hide the walking shadow on the stage  
All our yesterdays be soon forgotten  
There's an easy way to turn the page  
  
Yesterday's tomorrow is tomorrow's yesterday  
Find More lyrics at  
Destiny's forgotten, there's another game to play  
No more future perfect we just need the present tense  
All our yesterdays are only hanging in suspense  
  
Hang the banners high  
On the outward walls  
The battles lost and won  
That's when the hammer falls  
  
Racing to the future we must never lose our way  
All we have to do is take tomorrow's chance today  
  
All our yesterdays have come of age  
Now we all can sing a different song  
All our yesterdays have all departed  
The writing on the wall will soon be gone  
  
All our yesterdays (all our yesterdays)  
Now we all can sing a different song  
All our yesterdays (all our yesterdays)  
The writing on the wall will soon be gone  
  
All our yesterdays have come of age  
The writing on the wall will soon be gone

Well I sympathise completely but there's nothing I can do  
I am just a humble servant with a message here for you  
Well I know you have good reasons and there's things you've got to do  
But the boatman won't be waiting and he's leaving here with you  
And you can't take it with you  
No matter what you do  
No you can't take it with you  
Not the place you're going to

Well I sympathise completely but there's nothing I can do  
I am just obeying orders, I'm a simple soul like you  
Well you really are persuasive, but I've heard it all before  
And the boatman's getting restless as he stands upon the shore  
And you can't take it with you  
No matter what you do  
No you can't take it with you  
Not the place you're going to  
Can't take it with you

"The traveler is always leaving town  
He never has the time to turn around  
And if the road he's taken isn't leading anywhere  
He seems to be completely unaware  
  
The traveler is always leaving home  
The only kind of life he's ever known  
When every moment seems to be  
A race against the time  
There's always one more mountain left to climb  
  
Days are numbers, watch the stars  
We can only see so far  
Someday, you'll know where you are, remember  
  
Days are numbers, count the stars  
We can only go so far  
One day, you'll know where you are  
  
The traveler awaits the morning tide  
He doesn't know what's on the other side  
But something deep inside of him  
Keeps telling him to go  
He hasn't found a reason to say no  
  
The traveler is only passing through  
He cannot understand your point of view  
Abandoning reality, unsure of what he'll find  
The traveler in me is close behind  
  
Days are numbers, watch the stars  
We can only see so far  
Someday you'll know where you are  
  
Remember  
Days are numbers, count the stars  
We can only go so far  
One day, you'll know where you are  
  
Remember  
Days are numbers, watch the stars  
We can only see so far  
Someday you'll know where you are

"If you believe in the power magic,  
I can change your mind  
And if you need to believe in someone,  
Turn and look behind  
When we were living in a dream world,  
Clouds got in the way  
We gave it up in a moment of madness  
And threw it all away  
  
Dont answer me, dont break the silence  
Dont let me win  
Dont answer me, stay on your island  
Dont let me in  
  
Run away and hide from everyone  
Can you change the things weve said and done?  
  
If you believe in the power of magic,  
Its all a fantasy  
So if you need to believe in someone,  
Just pretend its me  
It aint enough that we meet as strangers  
I cant set you free  
So will you turn your back forever on what you mean to me?  
  
Dont answer me, dont break the silence  
Dont let me win  
Dont answer me, stay on your island  
Dont let me in  
  
Run away and hide from everyone

This golden day will be mine  
For every moment in time  
If time should lose her way  
  
A symphony in the night  
Of stars that dance in the light  
And music far away  
  
They say that love is but a dance  
Don't let the music fade away  
Don't let the moment pass  
  
Without reason or rhyme  
The sweet bouquet of the wine  
Will vanish in the air  
  
The innocence of the rose  
She leaves where she goes  
For all the world to share  
  
Some days when clouds are drifting by  
I open my eyes and watch them go  
And wonder where they fly  
  
Some nights orion runs too fast  
I look to the stars as if to say  
Don't let the moment pass  
  
But soon a golden age is past  
Just when it seemed that miracles  
Where not too much to ask  
  
And though the world may turn too fast  
If it should seem like paradise  
Don't let the moment pass

He rocks in his chair like a shiny dime  
But it's all for show, all for show.  
Wearing your name and a number or two  
When the minute's up, so are you  
But everybody knows, everybody knows.  
Watching the hour from the light in his eyes,  
He waits for your soul to come in from the sky  
But it's lost below, lost below.  
Turning the Wheel of your destiny round,  
When the motion stops no more sound,  
Does anybody care, anybody care.  
Where's the man, where's the child  
Wrapped together side by side.  
Who can tell you what to do,  
When Mr. Time has come for you.  
See the truth, hear the lies,  
Can there be no compromise  
And who can tell you what they knew,  
When Mr. Time has come for you.  
Is it a feeling of deja vu?  
When he points his finger calling you  
Is it illusion? Just an illusion  
Picking up seconds that fall to his feet  
He blows them away as rocks on his seat,  
Cool as his smile, his smile.  
Where's the man, where's the child  
Wrapped together side by side.  
Who can tell you what to do,

(I) Prelude  
  
""Shadows of shadows passing. It is now 1831, and as always I am  
absorbed with a delicate thought. It is how poetry has indefinite  
sensations, to which end music is inessential. Since the comprehension  
of sweet sound is our most indefinite conception, music, when combined  
with a pleasurable idea, is poetry. Music without the idea is simply music.  
Without music or an intriguing idea, colour becomes pallor, man becomes  
carcase, home becomes catacomb, and the dead are but for a moment  
motionless.""

And through my sleeping  
I heard a tapping at my door  
I looked but nothing lay in the darkness  
And so I turned inside once more  
To my amazement  
There stood a raven  
Whose shadow hung above my door  
Then through the silence  
It spoke that one word  
That I shall hear forever more  
Nevermore  
Thus quoth the raven, nevermore  
And still the raven remains in my room  
No matter how much I implore  
No words can soothe him  
No prayer remove him  
And I must hear for evermore  
Quoth the raven, nevermore  
Thus quoth the raven  
Nevermore

Taking my life  
One day at a time  
Cause I can't think what else to do  
Taking some time  
To make up my mind  
When there's no one to ask but you  
The same old sun would shine in the morning  
The same bright eyes would welcome me home  
And the moon would rise way over my head  
And get through the night alone  
And the same old sun will shine in the morning  
The same bright stars will welcome me home  
And the clouds will rise way over my head  
I'll get through the night on my own  
Tell me what to do  
Now there's nobody watching over me  
If I seem to be calm  
Well it's all an illusion  
Tell me what to do  
When the fear of the night comes over me  
There's a smile on my face  
Just to hide the confusion  
Taking my life  
One day at a time  
Cause I can't think what else to do  
Taking some time  
To make up my mind  
When there's no one to ask but you  
The same old sun would shine in the morning

While some may rise

We seek the soul that is not ours to keep  
  
No one is an island  
No one born alone

You drink the wine  
You play the fool  
You cross the line  
You lose your cool  
But no one cares  
Still no one cares  
  
You raise the bar  
Lost in a trance  
One bridge too far  
No second chance  
But no one cares  
Still no one cares  
  
We play the game  
We hold our own  
We fight to win  
We stand alone  
  
You had a dream  
You cast the dice  
Your shady scheme  
You paid the price  
But no one cares  
Still no one cares  
  
We play the game  
With hearts of stone  
You lose again  
You're on your own  
  
A turning tide  
A streak of light  
Arms open wide  
The end's in sight  
And someone cares  
Yes someone cares  
  
We play the game  
We hold our own  
We fight to win  
We stand alone

""For my own part, I have never had a thought which I could not set down  
In words with even more distinctness than that with which I conceived it.  
There is, however, a class of fancies of exquisite delicacy which are not  
Thoughts, and to which as yet I have found it absolutely impossible to  
Adapt to language. These fancies arise in the soul, alas how rarely.  
Only at epochs of most intense tranquillity, when the bodily and mental  
Health are in perfection. And at those weird points of time, where the  
Confines of the waking world blend with the world of dreams. And so I  
Captured this fancy, where all that we see, or seem, is but a dream within  
A dream. ""

"Is there no sign of light as we stand here in the darkness?  
Watching the sun arise  
Is there no sign of life as we gaze at the waters?  
Into the strangers eyes  
  
And who are we to criticize or scorn the things that they do?  
For we shall seek and we shall find Ammonia Avenue  
  
If we call for the proof and we question the answers  
Only the doubt will grow  
Are we blind to the truth or a sign to believe in?  
Only the wise will know  
  
And word by word they handed down the light that shines today  
And those who came at first to scoff, remained behind to pray  
And those who came at first to scoff, remained behind to pray  
  
When you can't hear the rhyme and you can't see the reason  
Why should the hope remain?  
For a man will be tired and his soul will grow weary  
Living his life in vain  
  
And who are we to justify the right in all we do?  
Until we seek until we find Ammonia Avenue  
  
Through all the doubt somehow they knew  
And stone by stone they built it high  
Until the sun broke through  
A ray of hope, a shining light Ammonia Avenue

Don't know why

And we'll drive through the rain  
We don't where we'll get to  
Or if we'll get back again  
  
Call along the valley  
And you just may find us there  
I couldn't say for certain  
Cause we may be anywhere  
Head into the sunset  
Or just wander out to sea  
Wherever your heart leads you  
Is the place you're meant to be  
  
And someone who could be impressed  
With ordinary lies  
Could really use a little peace of mind  
  
We are blown by the wind  
Just like clouds in the sky  
We don't know where we'll go,

Gaze at the sky

Of days in your life  
You knew what it meant to be happy and free  
With time on your side  
  
Remember your daddy  
When no one was wiser  
Your ma used to say  
That you would go further than he ever could  
With time on your side  
  
Think of a boy with the stars in his eye  
Longing to reach them but frightened to try  
Sadly, you'd say, someday, someday  
  
But day after day  
The show must go on  
And time slipped away  
Before you could build any castles in spain  
The chance had gone by  
  
With nothing to say  
And no one to say it to  
  
Nothing has changed  
You've still got it all to do  
Surely you know  
The chance has gone by

Call me a prophet of doom, I could think of nothing else.

But I was standing in a quicksand and I could not feel the ground.

He had a ring around his finger and something burning in his hand.

Yes it's funny you should say that  
  
And I told him of a dream  
Where I caught and ate a whale  
Then I woke up feeling hungry, he said  
That's a curious tale  
For a dream contains a wish  
In this case a giant fish  
As the pressure you were under  
Might have woken you from slumber

And he also wore a ring

You are tall and so your feet  
Must protrude beyond the sheet  
While you sleep they're unprotected  
And it's just as I suspected  
You were trying to dream some heat  
  
But there are six white wolves  
In the dead of the night  
On the branch of a tree  
  
And they have such big eyes  
And they're shining so bright  
All the better to see  
  
And they have such big ears  
All the better to hear  
And they're listening to me  
  
And they have such sharp teeth  
All the better to eat  
And they're looking at me  
  
Well it's funny you should say that

Yes it's funny you should say that  
  
I was speaking to a man  
But I don't recall a ring  
Yes it's funny you should say that  
  
And I told him of a dream  
Where I turned into a snail  
And he said it is simplicity  
To follow such a trail  
For this creature takes his shell  
Anywhere that he may roam  
  
But work must keep you on the move  
You fear your wife may disapprove  
So in the dream you just remove  
And take along your home  
  
If I step on a line  
Something will happen  
There are rats in a jar  
Something will happen  
  
And they have such big eyes  
And they're shining so bright

Where I turned into a hat  
That was round and made of fur, would he say  
Nothing wrong with that  
As I sit here in my chair  
I can see your growth is spare  
And it is my observation  
That this caused you much frustration  
So you dreamed a consolation  
To replace the loss of hair  
  
I'm going to be a mother

Suppose I were to tell you that the meaning of dreams  
Is not all that it seems and the ultimate truth is a lie.  
And you are just a puppet who can dance on a string.  
Do you feel anything?  
Would you laugh? Would you care? Would you cry?  
  
But the meaning of life is a mystery, how can anyone disagree?  
And the music is a symphony which we play in a minor key.  
  
I am a mirror. I am a mirror. Looking at me you see yourself  
I am a mirror. I am a mirror. Every face is someone else.  
Look at me smile and you're the clown. And if I dance you turn around.  
Look in my eyes and see your tears until the music disappears.  
  
So if you are confused and don't know which way to go.  
You will certainly know. From the moment we're living we die.  
And if it's all a crazy game you don't want to play  
Tell me what you can say.  
It's a joke. It's the truth. It's a lie.  
  
But the meaning of life is a mystery that we don't understand.  
And the music is a rhapsody if you're happy the way that you are.  
  
I am a mirror. I am a mirror. Looking at me you see yourself  
I am a mirror. I am a mirror. Every face is someone else.  
Look at me smile and you're the clown. And if I dance you turn around.  
Look in my eyes and see your tears until the music disappears.  
  
And the meaning of life is a mystery though we live it from day to day.  
But the music of live should be harmony so that anyone here can play.  
  
I am a mirror. I am a mirror. Looking at me you see yourself  
I am a mirror. I am a mirror. Every face is someone else.

I am lost for so many worlds  
I can not say why  
I can not say why  
Light of the world, i stand alone  
Cause i could not see the light of the world  
Show me the fire, in a true believer's eye  
Just a traveler, on an endless flight  
But no matter which way i turn, i journey into the night  
Going round in circles, till the mountains fall  
To believe in so many truths  
Makes no sense at all  
Makes no sense at all  
Light of the world, i stand alone  
Cause i could not see the light of the world  
I was afraid, cause i could not see the light of the world  
Show me the fire, in a true believer's eye

Money don't buy what you really need

Some day you might get over it, but in the meantime  
It burns you up in the first degree

The heart of the family

Mine are the arms to rock you  
When you're scared of the dark of the night

Where does a dream belong  
Locked in the mind on the edge of time  
Like a ship lost in a storm  
How do we find the key  
Longing to see, through the artist's eye  
Maybe only birds can fly  
  
The man must be insane who knows  
A mind alive with images so strange  
So close but never rode the sky  
  
Watching the birds as they sail on the wind  
Trying to figure out the reason why  
Picturing wings held together with string  
One day to fly  
  
Someone said and I believe  
Try if you dare, you can walk on air  
A dream is all you need  
A circle that takes you high  
Lighter than air as the earth goes by  
Through a spiral in the sky  
  
The man must be insane who knows  
A mind alive with images so strange  
So close but never rode the sky  
  
Watching the birds as they sail on the wind  
Trying to figure out the reason why  
Picturing wings held together with string  
  
Just a charcoal sketch on canvas  
Made them laugh but now they see  
That the artist had a vision  
That the wind could set us free  
It's a bridge until tomarrow  
Taking us beyond the sun  
As the artist paints his picture  
The story's just begun  
  
Analyzing, criticizing  
Fear of the unknown  
Theorizing, visualizing  
The road to take us home  
If it takes forever  
Someone's gonna fly  
We may never get to heaven  
But still we're gonna try  
  
Watching the birds  
As they sail on the wind  
One day to fly

I was lonely and depressed  
Having fled the family home  
When I met an old acquaintance  
I had only barely known  
  
And I told her over tea  
Of my worries and my woes  
And a morbid fear of eating beans  
In tightly fitting clothes  
  
And she said psychoanalysis was just the thing for me  
And she knew a mayfair analyst I really ought to see  
  
So I went round to his rooms  
And he saw me right away  
Though he asked a sum of money I could I'll afford to pay  
  
But I lay down on the couch  
By a bowl of flaccid flowers  
And I talked and talked and talked and talked  
For hours and hours and hours  
And he told me tales of oedipus with great authority  
  
And he asked me if my mother  
Wore stiletto heels and rubber  
And I realised that this poor soul  
Was more confused than me  
  
Well the shock was so profound  
That I fled into the strand  
Where I saw a hare krishna group  
And joined in with the band  
  
This was just the life for me  
Free of worldly goods and care  
And I chanted and I ranted  
Round and round trafalgar square  
  
I converted tens of thousands and they joined us then and there  
  
But the bagwan was so jealous  
That he called me over zealous  
Then he threw me out  
When I refused to cut off all my hair  
  
(dr. Ruth, dr. Ruth, why not write to dr. Ruth?)  
  
So I wrote to dr. Ruth  
And she helpfully proposed  
I should join a nudist colony  
And throw away my clothes  
  
All that sun upon my flesh  
Would set my libido free  
And would guarentee much more of it  
Whatever 'it' may be  
  
But I don't feel that I was quite equipped for such a life  
  
Fair of skin just like my sisters  
Too much sun would give me blisters

I can spring from the trap

That mountains are so high  
The river is too deep to cross  
And none of us can fly

Is what is needed here  
Or surely we become the things we fear  
  
But the good in me don't wanna believe  
That the evil me is so  
And a voice somewhere said do as you please  
But the upper me said no, no, no, no, no, no

Gave the salvation army girl a squeeze

Scattering her lace - on dewy ground

Lifting her head, her countenance redeemed  
Re-acted the murder by the silver stream  
Ah look at me now displaying emotion

Weave me some wings to take me to her grave

While on our knees we cry in prayer.  
We trip, we stumble, and we all fall down.  
Pain won't last, this too shall pass.  
We slip, we fumble, and we all fall down  
Round and round, time and time, again.  
But ahhhh,  
If it's so simple then explain to me.  
How pain is so close to ecstasy.  
How change can make you feel so free.  
Ahhhh,  
If we were meant to be such perfect fools.  
Then why do we always break the rules,  
Crashing through life's scenery.  
We trip, we stumble, and we all fall down.  
Angry cries and desperate lies.  
We slip, we fumble, and we all fall down  
Hearts to mend, sun comes up again.

From her garden she could see me  
In her silver-clad bikini  
Singing, dancing round her fruit tree  
  
Here we go round the lemon tree  
Mister, can't you hear me  
Here we go round the lemon tree  
Mister, don't come near me  
  
Could I calm her down by throwing stones at her  
If only I could make the right approach to her  
Think I'd rather tame a tiger  
Turn those lemons into cider  
Still I'd like to get beside her

Could the deadly shade of night still bring her there

"And the lamb lies down on Broadway.  
  
Early morning Manhattan,  
Ocean winds blow on the land.  
The Movie-Palace is now undone,  
The all-night watchmen have had their fun.  
Sleeping cheaply on the midnight show,  
It's the same old ending-time to go.  
Get out!  
It seems they cannot leave their dream.  
There's something moving in the sidewalk steam,  
And the lamb lies down on Broadway.  
  
Nightime's flyers feel their pains.  
Drugstore takes down the chains.  
Metal motion comes in bursts,  
But the gas station can quench that thirst.  
Suspension cracked on unmade road  
The trucker's eyes read 'Overload'  
And out on the subway,  
Rael Imperial Aerosol Kid  
Exits into daylight, spraygun hid,  
And the lamb lies down on Broadway.  
  
The lamb seems right out of place,  
Yet the Broadway street scene finds a focus in its face.  
Somehow it's lying there,  
Brings a stillness to the air.  
Though man-made light, at night is very bright,  
There's no whitewash victim,  
As the neons dim, to the coat of white.  
Rael Imperial Aerosol Kid,  
Wipes his gun-he's forgotten what he did,

He'd left and let nobody know.  
Gone were the towers he had known from a child,  
Alone with the dream of a life  
He traveled the wide open road,  
The blinkered arcade,  
In search of another to share in his life.  
Nowhere.  
Everyone looked so strange to him.  
  
They've got no horns and they've got no tail  
They don't even know of our existence.  
Am I wrong to believe in a city of gold  
That lies in the deep distance, he cried  
  
And wept as they led him away to a cage  
Beast that can talk, read the sign.  
The creatures they pushed and they prodded his frame  
And questioned his story again.  
But soon they grew bored of their prey  
Beast that can talk?  
More like a freak or publicity stunt.  
Oh  
No.  
  
They've got no horns and they've got no tail  
They don't even know of our existence.  
Am I wrong to believe in a city of gold  
That lies in the deep distance, he cried  
  
And broke down the door of the cage and marched on out.  
He grabbed a creature by the scruff of his neck, pointing out:  
There, beyond the bounds of you weak imagination  
Lie the noble towers of my city, bright and gold.  
Let me take you there, show you a living story  
Let me show you others such as me  
Why did I ever leave?  
  
They've got no horns and they've got no tail  
They don't even know of our existence  
Am I wrong to believe in a city of gold  
That lies in the deep distance, he cried  
And wept.  
  
And so we set out with the best and his horns  
And his crazy description of home.  
After many days journey we came to a peak  
Where the beast gazed abroad and cried out.  
We followed his gaze and we thought that maybe we saw  
A spire of gold - no, a trick of the eye that's all,  
But the beast was gone and a voice was heard:  
  
They've got no horns and they've got no tail  
They don't even know of our existence  
Am I wrong to believe in a city of gold  
That lies in the deep distance

When I take out my bottle, filled up high with gasoline,  
You can tell by the night fires where Rael has been, has been.  
  
Now, walking back home after a raid, he was cuddling a sleeping porcupine.  
That night he pictured the removal of his hairy heart and to the accompaniment
of very romantic music he watched it being shaved smooth by an anonymous
stainless steel razor.  
  
As I cuddled the porcupine  
He said I had none to blame, but me.  
Held my heart, deep in hair,  
Time to shave, shave it off, it off.  
No time for romantic escape,  
When your fluffy heart is ready for rape. No!  
Off we go...  
  
Your sitting in your comfort you don't believe I'm real,  
You cannot buy protection from the way that I feel.  
Your progressive hypocrites hand out their trash,  
But it was mine in the first place, so I'll burn it to ash.  
And I've tasted all the strongest meats,  
And laid them down in coloured sheets (laid them down in coloured  
Sheets).  
Who needs illusion of love and affection  
When you're out walking the streets with your mainline connection?  
Connection.  
  
As I cuddled the porcupine  
He said I had none to blame, but me.  
Held my heart, deep in hair.  
Time to shave, shave it off, it off.  
No time for romantic escape,  
When your fluffy heart is ready for rape. No!

"Big Jim Cooley commanded respect  
Whatever he wanted he could get  
The badge on his waistcoat shone in the sun  
It ain't no lie, Big Jim was feared by everyone  
  
In the saloon one evening Big took a bet  
With a rancher whose name I forget  
He wanted a herd taken over the plain  
And he called Jim ""yellow"", he'll never do that again  
  
He got mad!  
He threw his badge on the floor and walked out  
He's gonna give it a try, he left no doubt  
  
""Must be mad, must be mad""!  
The people wished him well, and good luck  
""Hell, I don't need it""! He laughed , got on  
His horse and rode away  
  
Over on the trail, Jim 'n' his crew of five  
Were trying their best to keep the cattle alive  
The weather was hard, but so were the men  
Though I don't think even Jim'll try this trip again  
  
His horses were edgy, sensing trouble ahead  
But the trouble didn't start till the men were in bed  
A-whooping and a-hollering and flashing their knives  
Big and his men were jumped by an all-star Indian tribe  
  
  
He was scared, Big Jim was scared  
Alive, they called him lucky, but not today  
Cos he died like all good cowboys with his boots on next to his men  
  
Big Jim, he still won't lie down  
For him the bet is still on  
Some say he rides there, cursing still  
Some say they've seen him

Held by the sand, washed by the waves  
A shadow forms cast by a cloud,  
Skimming by as eyes of the past, but the rising tide  
Absorbs them effortlessly claiming.  
  
They told of one who tired of all singing,  
""Praise him, praise him.""  
""We heed not flatterers,"" he cried,  
""By our command, waters retreat,  
Show my power, halt at my feet,""  
But the cause was lost,  
Now cold winds blow.  
  
For from the north overcast ranks advance  
Fear of the storm accusing with rage and scorn.  
The waves surround the sinking throne  
Singing ""Crown him, crown him,""  
""Those who love our majesty show themselves!""  
All bent their knees.  
  
But he forced a smile even though  
His hopes lay dashed where offerings fell (where they fell).  
""Nothing can my peace destroy as long as none smile.""  
More opened ears and opened eyes,  
And soon they dared to laugh.  
See a little man with his face turning red  
Though his story's often told you can tell he's dead.

With picks and with spades  
And a new kind of order  
Showing no fear of what lies up ahead  
They'll never see the likes of us again  
  
Driving the last spike  
Lifting and laying the track  
With blistering hands  
And the sun burning your back

I can see the tears in their eyes  
Oh memories of those I've left behind  
Still ringing in my ears  
'cause I'll always remember that night

Digging in darkness and living with danger  
Showing no fear of what lies up ahead

Don't you hear me

About her music, it all seemed so important then,  
  
And she dreamed that every time that she performed  
Everyone would cry for more,  
That all she had to do was step into the light,  
And everyone would start to roar.  
  
And on the road,  
Where all but a few fall by the wayside on the grassier verge,  
She battled through  
Against the others in her world, and the sleep, and the odds.

It wasn't so easy now, all uphill, and not feeling so strong.

Too much thinking 'bout the future and what people might want.

When nobody called for more  
And soon every time she stepped into the light,

Years seem so few (four instead of two).

And wait to board the bus  
That ambles down the street.

His claim was phrased quite simply, though he never voiced it loud,  
I am he, the chosen one.  
  
In his name they could slaughter, for his name they could die.  
Though many there were believed in him, still more were sure he lied,  
But they'll fight the battle on.  
  
Then one whose faith had died  
Fled back up the mountainside,  
But before the top was made,  
A misplaced footfall made him stray  
From the path prepared for him.  
Off of the mountain,  
On to a wilderness of ice.  
  
This unexpected vision made them stand and shake with fear,  
But nothing was his fright compared with those who saw him appear.  
Terror filled their minds with awe.  
  
Simple were the folk who lived  
Upon this frozen wave.  
So not surprising was their thought,  
This is he, God's chosen one,  
Who's come to save us from  
All our oppressors.  
We shall be kings on this world.

There he talked with water, and then with the vine.  
  
They leave me no choice.  
I must lead them to glory or most likely to death.  
  
They traveled cross the plateau of ice, up to its edge.  
Then they crossed a mountain range and saw the final plain.  
Still he urged the people on.  
  
Then, on a distant slope,  
He observed one without hope  
Flee back up the mountainside.

And the weak must die according to nature's law

Wreathe snatch-hand briers where owls know my eyes

Hungrily reach from my island.

"Garden Party held today, invites call the debs to play,  
Social climbers polish ladders, wayward sons again have fathers,  
Edgy eggs and queing cumbers, rudely wakened from their slumber,  
Time has come again for slaughter on the lawns by still  
  
Cam  
Waters.  
Champagne corks are firing at the sun again  
Swooping swallows chased by violins again  
  
Straafed by Strauss they sulk in crumbling eaves again.  
Apertifs consumed en masse display their owners on the grass  
Couples loiter in the cloisters, social leeches quoting Chaucer.  
Doctor's son a parson's daughter where why not and should they oughta  
  
Please don't lie on the grass, unless accompanied by a fellow,  
May I be so bold as to suggest Othello.  
Punting on the Cam is jolly fun they say  
Beagling on the downs Oh please come they say  
  
Rugger is the tops a game for men they say.  
Angie chalks another blue, mother smiles she did it too  
Chitters chat and gossips lash, posers pose pressmen flash.  
Smiles polluted with false charm, locking onto Royal arms,  
  
Society columns now ensured, return to mingle with the crowds  
Oh what a crowd.

Yet another emotional suicide overdosed on sentiment and pride  
Too late to say I love you, too late to re-stage the play  
Abandoning the relics in my playground of yesterday

To bleed the lyric for this song to write the rites to right my wrongs  
An epitaph to a broken dream to exercise this silent scream  
A scream that's borne from sorrow  
I never did write that love song, the words just never seemed to flow  
Now sad in reflection did I gaze through perfection  
And examine the shadows on the other side of the morning  
And examine the shadows on the other side of mourning  
Promised wedding now a wake

Sit and chew on daffodils and struggle to answer why?

Where you kissed your prince and found your frog  
Remember the jester that showed you tears, the script for tears  
So I'll hold our peace forever when you wear your bridal gown

Has gone solo in the game, I've gone solo in the game

They sent me away to the school in the park  
They said it would be good for me

Alone again in the lap of luxury  
Is there no escape from the lap of luxury  
  
I don't remember the last time I cried  
I don't remember much except lies

""One day this will all be yours"" he said  
Tidy your room and straight to bed  
Tidy up those thoughts in your head  
  
Alone again in the lap of luxury

If I only had the nerve to leave this house  
Maybe somewhere by the sea  
Take me somewhere, anywhere please!

On the sacrificial altar to success, my friend  
Unleash a stranger from a kiss, my friend  
No incantations of remorse, my friend  
Unsheathe the blade within the voice, my friend  
Who decorates the scarf with the fugi knot  
Who camouflaged emotion in a thousand yard stare  
Who gouged the notches from the family tree  
Who hypnotised the guilt in career rhythm trance  
Assassing, assassing, assassing, assassing  
Listen as the syllables of slaughter cat with calm precision  
Patterned frosty phrases rape your ears and sow the ice incision  
Apocalyptic alphabet casting spell the creed of tempered diction  
Adjectives of annihilation bury the point beyond redemption  
Venomous verbs of ruthless candour plagiarise assassins fervour  
A friend in need is a friend that bleeds  
Let bitter silence infect the wound  
You were a sentimental mercenary in a free fire zone  
Parading a Hollywood conscience  
You were a fashionable objector with a uniform fetish  
Pavlovian slaver at the cash till ring of success  
A non com observer - I assassin the collector - defector  
So you resigned yourself to failure, my friend  
And I emerged the chilling stranger, my friend

Trailing an ivy league jacket like a matador  
Through the jitterbug steps of the night before  
  
Through the chalk white chill and the tear fandango  
Heading away to the inner wrangle  
Do we cry for a cell?

Some of us go down in a haze of publicity  
The price of infamy, the edge of insanity  
  
Another Holiday Inn, another temporary home  
And an interviewer threatened me with a microphone  
'Talk to me, won't you tell me your stories.""  
  
So I talked about conscience and I talked about pain  
And he looked out the window and it started to rain

Resurrection in a trance, the model, the Grail, in a Marquee of promises

To end the Cinderella search, Cinderella search, oh no more, no more!

Awaiting development with paranoid Polaroid eyes, Polaroid eyes  
The footman memorised the number

And would you leave a palace for a bed sit  
And Canterbury Tales, Canterbury Tales?  
Maybe it was infatuation or the thrill of the chase  
  
Maybe you were always beyond my reach and my heart was playing safe  
But was that love in your eye I saw or the reflection of mine?  
I'll never really know for sure, you never really gave me time  
Give me time, won't you give me that time!

Betrayed by a porcelain tear, a stained career

I the mote in your eye, I the mote in your eye

In which you will always be the star, always be the star, untouchable  
Unapproachable, constant in the darkness  
Nursing an erection, a misplaced reaction

You who I let bathe in the spotlights glare

As you stutter paralysed with rabbits eyes, searing the shadows  
Flooding the wings, to pluck elusive salvation from the understudy's lips  
Retrieve the soliloquy, maintain the obituary  
My cue line in the last act and you wait in silent solitude  
Waiting for the prompt, waiting for the prompt

Refugees of romance plead asylum from the real.  
Scrambling distress signals on random frequencies,  
Forever repatriated on guilt laden morning planes.

To another summit conference, another breakfast time divorce,  
Screaming out a ceasefire, snowblind in an avalanche zone.

Empty chambers embracing the end.  
Puzzled visions haunt the ripples of a trevi moon,  
  
Dream coins for the fountain or to cover your eyes.  
We reached ignition point from the sparks of pleasantries,  
We sensed the smoke advancing from horizons,  
You must have known that I was planning, considering an escape.

Like loose change jingle janglin'  
At the bottom of your bag  
You don't seem to feel it though  
Because you swing down the street  
Walking that unique birthday candle glow  
In broad daylight, in broad daylight  
  
And you don't even know  
The way I love you  
  
You never knew power until you  
You thought that power was this scar  
People pass the laws in gold  
Seen our needs, emotional parts  
  
Oh baby, that's nothing  
  
You think it's kind of sweet  
The stammer and the tremble in my voice  
But don?t mistake it for weakness  
Or some kind of incompleteness  
'Cause round about now  
I can feel it tingle tanglin'  
It's coiled up inside me  
And it?s ready to blow  
  
You never knew power until you  
You saw it fizzed in the over-head lines  
Burning steel are borne to currents  
  
Satisfied the vertical pylons  
You never knew power until you  
Saw it roll like a head with thoughts  
Or melting stone, a new volcano  
Earthquake, thunder, lightning, stars  
  
The way I love you  
Is something you don't understand  
  
The way I love you  
Took more than I could imagine, even now  
You never knew how hard  
All the time you felt so strong  
  
But now you can't function  
The wave of a sleeve  
Is the meaningless slew  
Falls away from your feet  
And the Universe uses  
It's light, streaming free  
Life will scream in the meteor shower  
Of this guided light  
Where you sparkle and fail  
From heavens fell  
  
Take each guiding light  
In in every hour, in every hour  
I know the power, power  
  
Listen to me  
My feelings tremble  
Am I feeling?

"Huddled in the safety of a pseudo silk kimono  
Wearing bracelets of smoke, naked of understanding  
Nicotine smears, long, long dried tears, invisible tears  
Safe in my own words, learning from my own words  
Cruel joke, cruel joke  
Huddled in the safety of a pseudo silk kimono  
A morning mare rides, in the starless shutters of my eyes  
The spirit of a misplaced childhood is rising to speak his mind  
To this orphan of heartbreak, disillusioned and scarred  
A refugee, refugee.

It's a feeling I've been having for some time  
I look down upon myself and watch my movements  
A blind eye sees the fragile vandalised  
  
Watch this cold world dishing up these endless hollow men  
Find us anywhere you look  
Come and meet our friends  
Stand us in our silly clothes  
Put our batteries in  
Line us up like fairground ducks  
Watch us grin and grin  
See the lies behind our eyes  
See the will to win  
We'll buy you and we'll sell you  
But perhaps we'll save your skin  
  
Sit quietly and listen to the breeze  
The hollow and the lonely listen too  
Sniff the air for something we can use  
  
We're tin-hard and we rattle when we're shaken

I shouldn't admit it  
But I have.  
It slipped away while I was distracted  
I haven't changed  
I swear I haven't changed  
How did this happen?  
  
I didn't feel myself  
Evaporating...  
  
My body has gone

Hovering. Witnessing.  
Cold as a ghost ..watching the streets  
Sheltering in doorways of  
Venice, Vienna,  
Budapest, Krakow, and Amsterdam  
  
I have become the invisible man  
  
The invisible heart beating against you  
The invisible pulse silently thumping  
  
I shout my name in the public places  
No one seems to notice  
No one understands  
I stand perfectly still  
In the middle of the road  
I hold my nerve  
I hold my nerve  
Hold my nerve  
But the cars don't swerve  
  
I will hear your prayers  
As you whisper alone  
I am the one you felt was close  
Close behind you in St.Stephen  
You lit a candle  
Blessings in the cold night air  
  
I'll feel your breath as you turn to go  
I'll watch you leave  
From somewhere up high  
As you cross the park  
In the Autumn light  
In the Autumn light  
In the Autumn light  
  
If I close my eyes  
I can see where you live  
Climb the winding stairs  
Up to your apartment  
The scent of you preparing  
His evening meal  
I must watch in dread  
When he's cruel to you  
In horrified silence  
As you make love  
I cannot lift a hand  
Lift a hand to stop him  
I don't exist What can I do?  
What can I do?  
  
I will scream in your ear  
As you're passing by  
I will wrap my arms around you  
You won't hear, you won't feel me  
I will walk stride for stride with you  
I will try to help  
When you stumble  
You will stumble through me.  
  
I have become the invisible man  
It's all I am  
Invisible  
  
I have read all your letters  
I know what you contain  
I have dreamt your dreams  
My head..  
My head is haunted  
I will scream again  
'I am perfectly sane'  
'I am perfectly sane'  
But I am  
The invisible man  
I am  
The invisible man

Acknowledge me  
Confide in me  
Confess to me ... or  
Leave me be  
Leave me be.

Hotel hobbies padding dawns hollow corridors  
A typewriter cackles out a stream of memories  
  
Drying out a conscience, evicting a nightmare  
Opening the doors for the dreams to come home  
  
We live out lives in private shells  
Ignore our senses and fool ourselves  
To thinking that out there there's someone else cares  
Someone to answer all our prayers, all our prayers...  
  
Are we too far gone, are we so irresponsible  
Have we lost our balls, or do we just not care  
We're terminal cases that keep talking medicine  
Pretending the end isn't quite that near  
We make futile gestures, act to the cameras  
With our made up faces and pr smiles  
And when the angel comes down, down to deliver us  
We'll find out that after all, we're only men of straw  
  
But everything is still the same  
Passing the time passing the blame  
We carry on in the same old way  
We'll find out we left it too late one day to say what we meant to say  
  
Just when you thought it was safe to go back to the water  
Those problems seem to arise the ones you never really thought of  
The feeling you get is similar to something like drowning  
Out of your mind, you're out of your depth, you should have taken soundings  
Clutching at straws, we're clutching at straws, we're clutching at straws  
  
And if you ever come across us don't give us your sympathy  
You can buy us a drink and just shake our hands  
And you'll recognise by the reflection in our eyes that deep down inside we're
all one and the same  
  
We're clutching at straws  
We're still drowning  
Clutching at straws  
We're still drowning, yeah clutching at straws  
I'm still drowning  
We're clutching at straws  
I'm still drowning

Falling towards something out of control  
Unable to miss like the man in the tram

Crying midst my rubber plants, ignoring beckoning doors  
Clippings from ancient newspapers lie scattered cross the floor

"There was a boy who came into this world  
At the hands of a holy woman in a holy place  
He wore a red coat and walked a bulldog  
Saw them reflected in the mirror of the lakes  
Lived in the shadow of the mountains  
With the smells of disinfectant, dusty old leather  
And the polished wood of his bed  
No more than a baby feeding swans on the river  
Holding the hands of his mother  
And the wax paper bag of yesterday's bread  
  
And his father on the other side of the world  
On the ships railings and some far away tide  
With the silent dry tear of home thoughts from abroad  
In his far away eyes  
In his far away eyes  
  
The smell of the wax on the wooden floor  
Mixture of polish and soap  
No children to fear or to play with  
Rows of empty hooks for the coats  
An upright piano and the boys in the choir  
Still remind him of just before he was born  
Remind him of just before he was breathing  
Strange misty visions of God  
Turn the cities into families  
Into villages of souls  
Hovering in the air while they're sleeping  
With their houses invisible  
Chase the moon between the buildings  
Running as fast as I could run  
Send to me the ghosts of Christmas  
Whispering, ""You're the only one""  
  
And ever since I was a boy  
I never felt that I belonged  
Like everything they did to me  
Was an experiment to see  
How I would cope with the illusion  
In which direction would I jump  
Would I do it all the same  
As the actors in the game  
Or would I spit it back at them  
And not get caught up in their rules  
And live according to my own  
And not be used, not be used  
To find the fundamental truths  
It was going to take some time  
Thirty five summers down the line  
The wisdom of each passing year  
Seems to serve only to confuse  
Seems to serve only to confuse  
  
Daddy came out the navy and took us away  
To his dirty grey home town  
And he worked down on a coal mine for National Service  
So that he could be around  
There was a magical purple in the chrome of the exhaust  
Of his Triumph motor bike  
And a warmth of oil and metal and the thrill of the hard corner  
Holding tight  
  
From the horizon  
Came home from the Navy to the mine  
From the horizon  
To buried alive  
Took his dream underground  
Buried his treasure in his faraway eyes  
  
And one day as the boy lay sleeping in the sunshine  
Of a half remembered afternoon  
A cloud of bees with no particular aim, and no brain  
Found the boy, decided that his time had come  
Came down out of the sky  
Stung him in the face

Oh Mummy, Daddy, will you jog my memory

And the sun on the equator  
Setting like an ember thrown to deep water  
From crimson to black  
But coming back  
Tomorrow  
On the horizon  
  
The blue pain  
Fades to a point where it doesn't fade  
It stayed  
Blue  
Stirred his red coat heart to this strange engine  
This love  
  
This love  
This inconvenient, blind, blood-diamond  
This puzzle  
I don't understand  
That knows no faith  
And tries and fails  
And tries again  
Stares at the sea  
The night's dark deep  
For one last time  
And bleeds

Lucky man with a tux on, you're still the same with a tux on

A brother pulled his cuffs down to hide the blue-black vein  
His razor'd more than lines out, they found him just too late  
The final performance, the main man lies in state  
  
With a tux on, look at him now with a tux on  
The last time with a tux on, take him away with a tux on

Someone finds a photograph that triggers of a dream  
  
The uniform that symbolises the comfortable life  
He's always known his luck's in but now he's found the drive  
He's got a tux on, look at him now with a tux on  
He's gonna get one with a tux on, free admission with a tux on  
  
Get it anyway with a tux on  
He's got a tux on the easy way with a tux on, tux on

Last nights hero picking up his dues

Chalking up a name in your hometown  
Standing all your mates to another round  
Laughing at the world 'til the barman wipes away the warm wet circles

I saw teenage girls like gaudy moths  
A classroom's shabby butterflies  
Flirt in the glow of stranded telephone boxes  
Planning white lace weddings from smeared hearts and token proclamations  
Rolled from stolen lipsticks across the razored webs of glass  
  
Sharing cigarettes with experience with her giggling jealous confidantes  
She faithfully traces his name with quick bitten fingernails  
Through the tears of condensation that'll cry through the night  
As the glancing headlights of the last bus kiss adolescence goodbye  
In a warm wet circle  
  
Like a mothers kiss on your first broken heart, a warm wet circle  
Like a bullet hole in Central Park, a warm wet circle  
And I'll always surrender to the warm wet circles  
  
She nervously undressed in the dancing beams of the Fidra lighthouse  
Giving it all away before it's too late  
She'll let a lovers tongue move in a warm wet circle  
Giving it all away and showing no shame  
She'll take a mother's kiss on her first broken heart a warm wet circle

Of what is, will be, and was

Not because the zeroes line up  
We should change our way of thought  
More if we do not, the way ahead  
Is dangerously fraught  
And if we did the things we all know to be right  
Left would be the childish fears  
Of danger in the night.  
  
We, each of us are fine  
For we have all heard the word  
But grouped together

The thoughtless herd

With time perhaps I will pass the traps and find some peace and understanding

You leave me guessing, it's depressing  
Never to know the way to go to find some time along a little less pressing  
So you just have to laugh

The world will drag on you  
Use his love to pull you through  
Find the mission of your life and start to be  
  
All the old things are returning  
Cosmic circles ever turning  
All the truth we've been yearning for  
Life is our saviour, saviour, saviour, save your soul  
  
There's one thing I can do  
Play my mellotron for you  
Try to blow away your city blues  
Your dreams are not unfound  
Get your feet back on the ground  
The truth will set us free, we cannot lose  
We cannot love, we just have to choose

"Why do we never get an answer

Could safely lead me through  
  
Between the silence of the mountains  
And the crashing of the sea  
There lies a land I once lived in  
And she's waiting there for me

"Long time ago  
Back in the mist of time  
Back when the crystal waters flowed  
There was a world  
So strange and so beautiful  
All life would flourish and would grow  
Years went by, time just fell away  
Love was worshiped like the sun  
But as we arrive at the house  
Of the water sign  
We're living in strange times  
Strange times  
Strange times  
What do we need?  
What do we hunger for?  
Who holds the secrets, who will know?  
Temples of greed  
In ruins on the river bed  
Wastelands that lived before the snow  
Time stands still  
As we race through the universe  
On our way to the sun  
And as we arrive at the house  
Of the water sign  
We're living in strange times  
Strange times  
Strange times  
It's you and I forever  
We won't be afraid  
Even if the stars are falling down  
Down, down, down, down  
Falling down  
Time stands still  
As we race through the universe  
On our way to the sun

Tired of hearing stories, he said, she said  
Tired of hearing bout the crazy things you did  
Would you listen to me just once or twice?  
Make a difference in your life  
But you don't now

I've made changes I know you see  
No more old this is my new leaf  
Leaving behind all that's stressing me  
Needlessly, drama free  
(Oh oh oh) Can you hear me?  
(Oh oh oh) Can you feel me?  
Its not that I don't care about it  
Its just that I've got to do without it  
(One) My choice to just be done  
(Two) Hope I made it clear to you  
(Three) Something that works for me  
(Four) don't want the drama no more

"I woke up on this morning  
And misery surrounded me  
And I am forced to face a day  
I didn't even want to begin  
God knows I'm going through it  
And it's hard to imagine I can make it this time  
As my sadness mounts I pray that this day will end  
Cry myself to sleep and then start again  
  
When the world loses its luster  
And you're feeling sad and lonely  
And you need someone to be there  
In your time of need  
You can turn your eyes to the heavens  
And their creator's watching over you  
With arms of love to hold you and draw you near  
  
You're in the midst of heartache  
Perhaps you've lost a loved one  
Lost all your faith-can barely pray  
For the strength you need to go on  
Well, darling don't give up now  
I know that inevitably this too shall pass  
Trouble doesn't last always  
Hold on through the pain  
I believe the sun will outlast your rain

"So many times I've walked this way  
Too many times from you I've strayed  
Fallen way behind, too my former state of mind  
I look around what do I see, so many strugglin' just like me  
Tryin' to live this life, falling down to compromise  
But then I have a question, is that what we're living for?  
Aren't we called to perfection, to strive for so much more  
I find that we have settled too many times  
Should not be so, I think it's time God's letting us know  
Chorus:  
We need to get it right  
No need to walk this way this way no more  
We need to step in the light,  
And find out what we're livin' for  
The voice of God is drawing near  
Only the wisest ones will hear  
Seeing the world today will you choose to go his way  
It doesn't end in choosin', because in all we do  
We're called to keep on goin', pressin' on just to remain true  
(chorus)  
I can see how the other life it must look so nice  
But what lies after it's over far from paradise  
Gotta know there is nothing worth missing the call  
Let me tell you He is calling and you've got to give your all

"I'd say I'm always happy if you want me to  
But sometimes it's not the case  
My life is not as perfect as it seems to be  
It's simply God's amazing grace  
I'm here to finally let you know  
What keeps me hanging on  
What keeps me going strong  
I'm here to share His love with you  
There is no need to fear to live this life of love  
  
[Chorus:]  
With a little faith, with a little love  
I know we can make it  
I know we can make it  
With a little help sent from God above  
I know we can make it  
I know we can make it through  
  
I know what it takes to be yourself  
Instead of when they put you down  
I can't understand why you choose to hide  
When you should run to the strength I found  
If only you'd see for yourself  
Then you could know the one  
Who loves you so much more  
If only I could help you out  
But God's the only one  
  
What are you waiting for  
  
[Repeat chorus]  
  
It seems to wash away  
Can't find a will to go on  
But I am here to say there's hope  
You must carry on  
Jesus will light your way  
He'll give you all that you need  
No need to be afraid all you've got to do is believe

"I've been down and out wondering what it all about  
So many pressures and the burden seemed too much for me to bear  
I tried to fight it, but there were shackles on my hands  
Tried to deny it, 'til oppression took command  
Turned to the Savior and He opened up my eyes  
It caught me by surprise, told me somethin' that was no lie  
Chorus:  
It's a good time, a good time to be free  
It's a good time, time to get free inside  
It's a good time, a good time to believe  
It's a good time, time to get free inside  
Now you're down and out wondering what your life's about  
Try to laugh your fears away, so you party everyday  
What you are feeling, there ain't nothing new to find  
What you don't know is, your life is on the line  
Time to discover, there's so much more to this than just the way you live  
I know someone with freedom to give  
(chorus)  
So let your spirit hear, and put your mind behind  
There's a freedom that only in Him you'll find  
If you heed the call you will have all you need  
'Cause who the Son sets free you know is free, free indeed

What do you want to do with your life  
Its up to you, you've got to decide  
There's freedom here if you want it, just make up your mind

I never though I'd know someone who loved me so  
To go as for to die that His love for me would show  
I searched all over but I still couldn't find  
Someone to give me love to heal my hurt and ease my mind  
I sought affection tried everything new  
Didn't even know that I was lost without a clue  
Chorus:  
You have opened my eyes to a greater love  
You have opened my eyes to a greater love  
I used to be so blind but now it's clear to me  
How your love was displayed by what you did on Calvary  
I've got to tell the world that they might hurt you  
To find what I've found to really see how  
You have captured my soul, you have made me whole  
You have set me free 'cause I have given you control  
You have mended my heart and I have been redesigned  
Lord with everything you are, you have been blowin' my mind

Man is imperfect, there is just one perfect soul  
So much more loving than than one that you've been shown  
How long is it gonna take for you to realize?

Because the God I know would never do the things they do  
Mercy and compassion on the right and on the left

I remember begging my mom for these Z. Cavarricci's  
With a striped genera shirt just to rock with these brutini's  
I begged and I begged, of course she said no  
So I committed to cutting grass just to conjour up the dough  
With a little extra change I'll cut a slope and a fade  
I'll be the freshest of the men in the midst of ninth grade  
It's crazy how we place these small things as important  
While the monument's reminding us of washed up Jordan's  
Rivers that is, not the be -ball player, told the mountains to  
Move and now there's no more Himalayas  
Had to set the devil straight since he was highly overrated  
Spoke and mountains moved and then the Alps disintegrated  
Racing through the fire I perspire like He times me  
And cross the finish line to realize that He's refined me  
Can't wait for morning breaks as joy turns from sorrow  
Busting victory laps around mount Kilimajarro  
Oh, we've made it this far and there's no turning back now  
With all of the joy deep inside  
We'll be praising His name, clapping hands while we're singing  
And dancing 'til the morning light, that's right, that's right  
Weight upon my shoulders, held a burden and they thought  
I'd never make it over, so I had to prove them wrong  
I never stopped believing, not a doubt in my mind  
The blessings I'm receiving, have cast the fears aside, yeah  
Wasn't easy, I got to let you know, had a lot to overcome  
But He loves me, he showed me the way to go  
Feels like life has just begun

I'm a scream from the rooftops, freckled face figment, light  
Complected pigment, least expected remnant, over flooding  
Supercharged enlarged freshly gutted, surgically removed was  
The flesh Jesus cut it. Was allotted when I got it, most  
Happiest, most joyful, vibrant, vibrating, dance around  
Illustrating. My matrix, a labyrinth, a maze, a holographic image,  
No end to my phonographic limits. If you've seen it once you've seen

I'm open, before receiving Christ in darkness groping, Proverbs 4  
The focus of the diagnosis spoken made the decision to collision  
With incision self division multiplying and relying, sinful dying  
Cling to vision thank God in all I do, uh-uh, thank God in all I do  
Can't entrap me and I'm happy born anew  
Won't be easy, I've got to let you know  
There's a lot to overcome  
But He loves you, He'll show you the way to go  
You will feel like life has just begun  
  
[Rap by Bonified:]  
I got to keep moving and never carry the weight  
Trying to do it myself instead of walking in faith  
Leaving the rest to Him, giving my best to Him  
And put my flesh to death without a breath to take  
Had to battle the beats and overcame defeat  
Another factor of the seven from the garden of Eden  
Bonafied a true survivor of the wilderness  
Blessed beyond I gotta move on I gotta move on  
If you want to dance with me  
Now's your chance to be totally set free  
If you're in the groove  
And you know God is seeing you through  
Better make your move

The situation worsens every day that goes by

So heavy on me all those that are hurting inside

For every word of love unspoken

Sometimes life it seems a bit too much for me  
More things we must survive on top of all that we had before  
Broken hearts, broken homes, kids abused left alone  
So many in the streets, homeless with no food to eat

"Little sarah jane ran away from home  
Fourteen and pregnent she was all alone  
Couldn't run from wrong, and was gonna be sent away  
Walkin' with her black and blue eyes full tears  
The burden that she carries much to old for her years  
Looking at her face would confirm your worst fears  
But instead she goes unnoticed  
Sarah Jane another girl who is dying inside  
You'd think that someone would stop  
But we hide, to intent on completing our day  
And she's left there to say  
Chorus:  
Do you hear me?  
Can you see me?  
Walking down the street watching you  
You could help me  
But your not looking  
I bet you would if only you knew  
You could make a difference  
Do you hear me?  
Can you see me?  
Walking down the street needing you  
I want to make it  
How can I get there?  
If you showed me that you cared, you know  
You could make the difference  
He's left to watch the world from the fifteenth floor  
Alone with the reminder, don't go out anymore  
You know those boys are trouble here in our neighborhood  
But you're my boy and you've got the chance to be something good  
Still the call of the streets was too much to ignore  
Now he's caught up in the game and can't find an open door  
He's a good boy gone bad and he's trying to get out  
But everybody's too afraid to hear what he's talking about  
Marcus Brown, lives a life much too old for his age  
If no one responds, he'll be words on a page  
Another statistic cause no calls were made  
To check on the boy who was missing from the fifth grade

Its such a shame that we could change a life but we don't try  
To look outside out world

Why is that smile upon your face  
When it's such a rainy day  
Why are you so happy?  
What do you know that I don't know?  
I wish I did but aint been told  
So tell me, what's your secret?  
I met a girl the other day at the supermarket  
Ringing up all of my things  
She had the strangest look upon her face  
Wish you could have been there  
Just to see the way she looked at me  
Thought I must look crazy something out of place  
But paid it no attention  
Just kept going with my business  
I looked up because she stepped into my space  
Saw pain in her eyes  
Her question took me by surprise she said  
I didn't have the faintest clue where to begin  
So I asked some questions (just to see what I was dealing with)  
She told me where she was and where it was she'd been  
What an awful tale life hadnt done her well  
She had thoughts of leaving  
Bridge:  
(Before you go) let me tell my story  
(Once like you, you know) all guts and no glory  
(But now I have joy) the reason why  
Whos in my life  
That is why you're asking me  
See the moral of the story is the whole worlds watching you  
So be careful what you say and be careful what you do  
Never know when it will be your time to show someone the way  
So be a guiding light and shine so they'll say

So I ignored their advice and I tried to disguise pain from you and all the
things you did  
The wrong road was chosen my heart has been broken  
Cause I didn't want to hear them

Shoulda went right but I went left that day  
Shoulda prayed but instead I strayed  
Shoulda gone a different way  
Shoulda listened to my mother  
When she said that you were no good for me  
Shoulda listened to my pastors  
When they told me turn around and leave you be  
Shoulda listened to my sisters  
When they said that I was too blind to see  
But I see the light somehow  
And I vow to listen now  
I had the chance to advance and it seemed like the best  
Opportunity that I could get  
I didn't bother to see if my people agreed  
Maybe I knew what they would say and yet  
I didn't control it I kept going for it  
When I shoulda known it wasn't in Gods plan  
Had to let go, had I listened before  
I wouldve said no from the door

You gotta sleep on your toes, and when you're on the street,  
You gotta be able to pick out the easy meat with your eyes closed.  
And then moving in silently, down wind and out of sight,  
You gotta strike when the moment is right without thinking.  
  
And after a while, you can work on points for style.  
Like the club tie, and the firm handshake,  
A certain look in the eye and an easy smile.  
You have to be trusted by the people that you lie to,  
So that when they turn their backs on you,  
You'll get the chance to put the knife in.  
  
You gotta keep one eye looking over your shoulder.  
You know it's going to get harder, and harder, and harder as you get older.  
And in the end you'll pack up and fly down south,  
Hide your head in the sand,  
Just another sad old man,  
All alone and dying of cancer.  
  
And when you loose control, you'll reap the harvest you have sown.  
And as the fear grows, the bad blood slows and turns to stone.  
And it's too late to lose the weight you used to need to throw around.  
So have a good drown, as you go down, all alone,  
Dragged down by the stone.  
  
I gotta admit that I'm a little bit confused.  
Sometimes it seems to me as if I'm just being used.  
Gotta stay awake, gotta try and shake off this creeping malaise.  
If I don't stand my own ground, how can I find my way out of this maze?  
  
Deaf, dumb, and blind, you just keep on pretending  
That everyone's expendable and no-one has a real friend.  
And it seems to you the thing to do would be to isolate the winner  
And everything's done under the sun,  
And you believe at heart, everyone's a killer.

You have grown colder and  
Nothing is very much fun any more.

Tight as a tourniquet,  
Dry as a funeral drum.  
  
Run to the bedroom,  
In the suitcase on the left  
You'll find my favorite axe.  
Don't look so frightened  
This is just a passing phase,  
One of my bad days.  
Would you like to watch T.V.?  
Or get between the sheets?  
Or contemplate the silent freeway?  
Would you like something to eat?  
Would you like to learn to fly?  
Would'ya?  
Would you like to see me try?  
  
Would you like to call the cops?  
Do you think it's time I stopped?  
Why are you running away?

Impale themselves on six-inch nails

Impersonates a watering can  
  
Some Santa Claus-like face of note  
Entreats my ears to set afloat  
My feeble sick and weary brain  
And I am overcome with shame  
And hide inside my overcoat

While some Arabian sheikh most grand  
Impersonates a hot-dog stand  
  
The Red Cross ambulance outside  
Can only mean that I must hide  
'Til dusk and finally the night  
When I will make a hasty flight  
Across the sea and far away  
To where the weary exiles stay

Impersonates a padded cell

A twisted path, our tortured course,  
And no one left alive.

Where ships come home to die.  
No lofty peak, nor fortress bold,  
Could match our captain's eye.  
Upon the seventh seasick day,  
We made our port of call.  
A sand so white, and sea so blue,  
No mortal place at all.  
  
We fired the guns, and burned the mast,  
And rowed from ship to shore.

Have passed since we made land.

"A modest man from mandrake

In a final flash of glory  
Nevermore to grace the night...

Headed for the heart of Cygnus

"When our weary world was young  
The struggle of the ancients first began  
The Gods of love and reason  
Sought alone to rule the fate of man  
  
They battled through the ages  
But still neither force would yield  
The people were divided  
Every soul a battlefield  
Every soul a battlefield  
  
I bring truth and understanding  
I bring wit and wisdom fair  
Precious gifts beyond compare  
  
We can build a world of wonder  
I can make you all aware  
I will find you food and shelter  
Show you fire to keep you warm  
Through the endless winter storm  
  
You can live in grace and comfort  
In the world that you transform  
  
The people were delighted  
Coming forth to claim their prize  
They ran to build their cities  
And converse among the wise  
  
But one day the streets fell silent  
Yet they knew not what was wrong  
They urge to build these fine things  
Seemed not to be so strong  
  
The wise men were consulted  
And the bridge of death was crossed  
In quest of Dionysus  
To find out what they had lost  
  
I bring love to give you solace  
In the darkness of the night  
In the heart's eternal light  
  
You need only trust your feelings  
Only love can steer you right  
  
I bring laughter, I bring music  
I bring joy and I bring tears  
I will soothe your primal fears  
  
Throw off those chains of reason  
And your prison disappears  
  
The cities were abandoned  
And the forests echoed song  
They danced and lived as brothers  
They knew love could not be wrong  
  
Food and wine they had aplenty  
And they slept beneath the stars  
The people were contented  
And the Gods watched from afar  
  
But the winter fell upon them  
And it caught them unprepared  
Bringing wolves and cold starvation  
And the hearts of men despaired  
  
The universe divided  
As the heart and mind collided  
With the people left unguided  
For so many troubled years  
In a cloud of doubts and fears  
Their world was torn asunder  
Into hollow hemispheres  
  
Some fought themselves, some fought each other  
Most just followed one another  
Lost aimless like their brothers  
For their hearts were so unclear  
And the truth could not appear  
Their spirits were divided  
Into blinded hemispheres  
  
Some who did not fight  
Brought tales of old to light  
My Rocinante sailed by night  
On her final flight  
  
To the heart of Cygnus fearsome force  
We set our course  
Spiraled through that timeless space  
To this immortal race  
  
I have memory and awareness  
But I have no shape or form  
As a disembodied spirit  
I am dead and yet unborn  
I have passed into Olympus  
As was told in tales of old  
To the city of immortals  
Marble white and purest gold  
  
I see the Gods in battle rage on high  
Thunderbolts across the sky  
I cannot move, I cannot hide  
I feel a silent scream begin inside  
  
Then all at once the chaos ceased  
A stillness fell, a sudden peace  
The warriors felt my silent cry  
And stayed their struggle mystified  
  
Apollo was astonished  
Dionysus thought me mad  
But they heard my story further  
And they wondered and were sad  
  
Looking down from Olympus  
On a world of doubt and fear  
It's surface splintered  
Into sorry hemispheres  
  
They sat a while in silence  
Then they turned at last to me  
(We will call you Cygnus)  
(The God of balance you shall be)  
  
We can walk our road together  
If our goals are all the same  
We can run alone and free  
If we pursue a different aim  
  
Let the truth of love be lighted  
Let the love of truth shine clear sensibility  
Armed with sense and liberty  
With the heart and mind united  
In a single, perfect, sphere

With the answers, but no clue  
  
He'd love to spend the night in Zion  
He's been a long while in Babylon  
He'd like a lover's wings to fly on  
To a tropic isle of Avalon

Subdivided and synthetic

In the science of the day

Constant change is here to stay

So that which I imagine  
Is that which I believe

You can miss a stride  
But nobody gets a free ride  
More than high performance  
More than just a spark  
More than just the bottom line  
Or a lucky shot in the dark  
In the long run...  
  
You can do a lot in a lifetime  
If you don't burn out too fast  
You can make the most of the distance  
First you need endurance  
First you've got to last...

The Watchmaker keeps to his schemes  
The hours tick away - they tick away  
  
The measure of a life is a measure of love and respect  
So hard to earn, so easily burned

A garden to nurture and protect  
  
In the rise and the set of the sun  
'Til the stars go spinning - spinning 'round the night

Each moment a memory in flight  
  
The arrow flies while you breathe, the hours tick away - the cells tick away  
The Watchmaker has time up his sleeve  
The hours tick away - they tick away  
  
The treasure of a life is a measure of love and respect  
The way you live, the gifts that you give  
In the fullness of time  
It's the only return that you expect  
  
The future disappears into memory  
With only a moment between  
Forever dwells in that moment  
Hope is what remains to be seen

Waiting for the world's applause  
Rebel without a conscience  
Martyr without a cause

Electrical storm in your veins  
Raging at unreachable glory  
Straining at invisible chains

Staring down into a heartless sea  
Can't face life on a razor's edge  
Nothings what you thought it would be

Dreamers learn to steer by the stars  
All of us do time in the gutter  
Dreamers turn to look at the cars  
Turn around and turn around and turn around  
Turn around and walk the razor's edge

Blocks the only road  
It's not as if you're all alone  
In wanting to explode  
  
Someone set a bad example  
Made surrender seem all right  
The act of a noble warrior  
Who lost the will to fight  
  
And now you're trembling on a rocky ledge  
Staring down into a heartless sea  
Done with life on a razor's edge  
Nothings what you thought it would be

No daring in your escape  
No salutes for your surrender  
Nothing noble in your fate

"Love is born with lightning bolts  
Electro-magnetic force  
Burning skin and fireworks  
A storm on a raging course  
  
Like a force of nature,  
Love can fade with the stars at dawn  
Sometimes it takes all your strength  
Just to keep holding on  
At the speed of love  
A radiance that travels  
At the speed of love  
My heart goes out to you  
  
Love is born with solar flares  
From two magnetic poles  
It moves towards a higher plane  
Where two halves make two wholes  
  
Like a force of nature,  
Love shines in many forms  
One night we are bathed in light  
One day carried away in the storms  
At the speed of love  
Nothing changes faster  
Than the speed of love  
My heart goes out to you  
  
We don't have to talk  
We don't even have to touch  
I can feel your presence  
In the silence that we share  
Got to keep moving  
At the speed of love  
Nothing changes faster  
Than the speed of love  
Got to keep on shining  
At the speed of love  
Nothing changes faster  
Than the speed of love

There is trouble in the forest

And the oaks, just shake their heads  
  
So the maples formed a union

'The oaks are just too greedy  
We will make them give us light'

I remember Christopher  
such a man  
so brave and tall  
  
he took the baby Jesus  
in his arms  
across the waterfall  
  
people cried, ""he's holy!  
he's a saint not a man!""  
all at once it was written  
in the book of the land  
  
Christopher, Mr. Christopher  
why won't they leave you alone?  
Christopher, Mr. Christopher  
why won't they leave you alone?  
  
there was Mary Margaret  
a Christian lady  
dressed in black  
  
she believed St. Christopher  
helped her find  
a way back  
  
she told him all her secrets  
and the dreams of her years  
so when they took that saint away  
all that's left were her tears  
  
Mary cried ""they're crazy!  
the world is changing too fast!""  
it was then she discovered  
that her faith couldn't last  
  
Christopher, Mr. Christopher  
why won't they leave you alone?

So sure those days would never end

On a crowded street today

Could it maybe be a cry for help  
Can't see the forest from your tree there  
  
Sometimes I think you're doing well  
Other times you put yourself through hell  
It's enough to bring you to your knees dear  
  
I'm gonna open up to you  
It's all I'm really trying to do  
Say what's on my mind

Running here and there and everywhere  
Now I know exactly how your mind is wired  
  
I always knew this day would come  
To face the monster you've been hiding from  
So either douse the flame of love  
Or stoke the fire  
  
Or we can play this guessing game  
I call your bluff you do the same  
We're just wasting time  
Wasting all my time, listen

Yeah you gotta do things my way

All you gotta do is do things my way  
  
I know you never like to compromise  
But when you think of all the lonely nights  
And I see that look in your eyes  
I'd say it's time to simplify your thinking  
  
Why does it have to be so hard  
To play your hand and show your cards  
If you will I will  
If you will I will  
  
Before you get your just desserts  
Let me clear your table first  
Have you, have you had your fill  
  
If you wanna have it your way

In the dark so all alone  
Slowly reach for the telephone  
A message waits just for you  
A secret place, another rendezvous  
  
It's not always honesty  
That is the best policy  
But little lies can give you away  
Though you'll deny it if they say maybe you're just  
  
Leading a double life  
Friends in the daytime, strangers at night  
Leading a double life  
Can it be wrong when you know that it's right?  
  
The other side of the Berlin Wall is  
Not far enough to avoid the call  
Somebody knows, somebody's seen  
Somebody knows right where you've been  
And that you're just  
  
Leading a double life  
Friends in the daytime, strangers at night  
Leading a double life  
Can it be wrong when you know that it's right?  
  
Nowhere to hide, though we both might try  
I'm schizophrenic, and so am I  
Double life, a double life, a masquerade  
You know we all live a masquerade  
I know you're out there!  
  
Leading a double life  
Friends in the daytime, strangers at night

Care less the clouds above me  
The wind is gently lifting my hair  
Where the rivers of the wind fall light rain

Walk alone through the garden

Is drawing me near  
  
Content to rest awhile  
Pondering the motion of time  
Over unforgotten memories  
Dipped in wine  
  
Listen to the flowing streams  
Golden in the shelter of my dreams  
Playing a song on the meadow that echoes with love  
  
The god of dusk is falling around me  
The night air now restless and dank  
Yet the fields are specked with flowers  
Few and rank  
  
Moon reflecting off the water  
Rippling an image to me  
Of the way that it is  
And the way that it's going to be

There in the fog his song kept calling me

Deep in my heart a voice kept echoing  
I knew I'd soon be wandering  
  
Far beyond these castle walls  
Where the distant harbour meets the sky  
There the battle raged like hell  
And every dove had lost its will to fly

Life is never what it seems

Try as you will, you can't escape the chill  
that penetrates your clothing,  
demanding that you feel  
all the trouble that surrounds you,  
the bad mixed with the good,  
the heartless bits of data waiting to be understood  
Information Central promptly processed your request,  
the task we're told honestly requires you acquiesce.  
  
Well, blind faith put you where you are now  
You're a selfish old cow gettin' high on society's milk.  
We pay your bills, life should be so tough.  
You'd better watch your fat ass, 'cause we've had enough!

We live happily forever so the story goes  
But somehow we missed out on that pot of gold  
But we'll try best that we can to carry on

They said come sail away come sail away  
Come sail away with me  
Come sail away come sail away  
Come sail away with me

One hundred percent  
No saint, no Pope, no King no Queen  
No President  
  
But our hunger for heroes  
Has made us blind  
We seek salvation  
From the cup of human kind  
  
But every time we hear the voice  
Of some new Abraham  
We wake too late to realize  
It was just another scam  
  
Fallen angel, fallen angel  
Well I guess you were no angel after all  
Fallen angel, fallen angel  
You always take us with you when you fall  
  
I said nobody's perfect  
From head to toe  
Not Einstein or Elvis or Lenin or Marx  
Or Marilyn Monroe  
  
Cause it's mostly illusion  
In flesh and bone  
An image, a look, a song or a book  
That we all claim for our own  
  
But even in the best of us  
There lies beneath the skin  
The tragic flaw in nature's law  
That's bound to do us in  
  
Fallen angel, fallen angel  
Well I guess you were no angel after all  
Fallen angel, fallen angel  
You always take us with you when you fall  
  
Pretty faces up on the silver screen  
Flawless bodies on covers of magazines  
They all look perfect to us  
So rich and cool and bored  
But hold the presses boys  
They've checked into Betty Ford  
  
Turns out nobody's perfect  
From ""A"" to ""Z""  
It's best to follow your heart  
Then to follow me  
Cause I'm only a singer  
Playin' a song  
And I've just been making it up  
As I went along  
  
See I met a man who told me once  
""Sincerity's the key  
And once you learn to fake it  
Son you're gonna be home free""  
  
Fallen angel, fallen angel  
Well I guess you were no angel after all  
Fallen angel, fallen angel  
You always take us with you when you fall

When Captain Jonas Psalter  
Sailed his ship to sea  
Anne Bonny kept him company  
  
The skull and crossbones flew  
Above the ocean blue  
The captain's men where a pirate's crew  
  
The ships they sought to take  
Were of the Spanish Main  
A gift from Ferdinand of Spain  
  
And though you rob and kill to find your dream  
Your crimes are hardly what they seem  
  
Tortuga held the treasure of a thousand kings  
So Jonas planned to steal everything  
  
Two hundred men stood guard  
Around the fortune's nest  
But Psalter's steel slew all the rest  
  
And when the smoke had cleared  
And bloody bodies lay  
Everyone could hear the minstrel play  
  
Woo woo Jonas Psalter  
You've captured every prize  
There is to dream of in one life  
  
And so we wonder why  
We found you in your bed  
With that bullet in your head

"Brick by brick you built a mansion  
Piece by piece it seems  
You're tearing it down  
  
Once you walked so tall and handsome  
Now nobody even wants you around  
Now you're just some kind of  
Leftover clown  
Now you're like Quasi Modo crying  
  
As you look in the mirror  
At what you've become  
Killing the thing that you love  
Like Lennon's assassin  
Lennon's assassin  
  
Reaching for Venus De Milo  
But she's never gonna hold you tight  
You plant plutonium silos  
Then you blister from the sun that's too bright  
Like a vampire stepping into the light  
Just a victim of your own greed as you  
  
Look in the mirror  
At what you've become  
Killing the world that you love  
Like Lennon's assassin  
Lennon's assassin  
  
The genius of a generation  
Blown away just like a leaf on the wind  
And now you're looking for salvation  
But you can't forget the places you've been  
And you can't erase a lifetime of sin  
And you can't escape the answers as you  
  
Look in the mirror  
At what you've become  
Dredging the river for what you have done  
Killing the thing that you love

Krakatoa you've changed your ways  
from evil days.  
Oh I know a once violent isle  
and gentle smile.  
When the dust and lava cooled  
you were sterile as the rock from which the earth was tooled.  
Was man's beginning a wind borne spore  
to fly no more?  
Nature's winning her docile spree  
has set her free.  
Seeds were wafted on the wind  
forming heavy undergrowth for species winged and finned.  
Tangled mangles rebuilt your soil  
from age dead toil.  
Sheltered bay coves protecting life  
from Satan's knife.  
Grow and island in the sun  
where the hell fire belching earth had destructively left none.

You gave all the love that I needed

"You were the apple of the public's eye as you cut the ribbon at the local mall  
A mirage for both you and us. How can it be real?  
We love your body in that photograph, your home state sure must be proud  
The queen of the United States, or have you lost your crown  
  
Well aren't you Miss America  
Don't you Miss America  
Won't you Miss America  
Our love  
  
Well are you really who we think you are  
Or does that smile seem to wear you down  
This girl who you once were is screaming jump out  
This dream that you must live, a disease for which there is no cure  
This roller coaster ride you're on won't stop to let you off  
  
Well aren't you Miss America  
Don't you Miss America  
Won't you Miss America

Miss America, Miss America  
Miss America, Miss America  
  
Well it's true just take a look  
The cover sometimes makes the book  
And the judges, do they ever ask to read between your lines  
And in your cage at the human zoo, they all stop to look at you  
Next year, what will you do when you have been forgotten  
  
Well aren't you Miss America  
Don't you Miss America  
Won't you Miss America

You're wondering who I am-machine or mannequin  
With parts made in Japan, I am the modern man  
  
I've got a secret I've been hiding under my skin  
My heart is human, my blood is boiling, my brain I.B.M.  
So if you see me acting strangely, don't be surprised  
I'm just a man who needed someone, and somewhere to hide  
To keep me alive, just keep me alive  
Somewhere to hide to keep me alive  
  
I'm not a robot without emotions, I'm not what you see  
I've come to help you with your problems, so we can be free  
I'm not a hero, I'm not a savior, forget what you know  
I'm just a man whose circumstances went beyond his control  
Beyond my control, we all need control  
I need control, we all need control  
  
I am the modern man, who hides behind a mask  
So no one else can see my true identity  
  
Domo arigato, Mr. Roboto, domo, domo  
Domo arigato, Mr. Roboto, domo, domo

Thank you very much, Mr. Roboto  
For doing the jobs nobody wants to  
And thank you very much, Mr. Roboto  
For helping me escape to where I needed to  
Thank you, thank you, thank you  
I want to thank you, please, thank you, oh yeah  
  
The problem's plain to see, too much technology  
Machines to save our lives. Machines dehumanize.  
  
The time has come at last  
To throw away this mask  
Now everyone can see  
My true identity  
I'm Kilroy! Kilroy! Kilroy! Kilroy!

The rhythm really gets to me

I crank the volume all the way  
  
Turn it on  
Turn it up

They don't ask questions

Go ahead and go for it

I've had enough reality

I'm overworked and underpaid

I like big things

Don't hold back your one chance  
It hardly lasts, it hardly lasts  
Better, better believe in forever  
  
Out here I stand with my heart in my hand  
My hopes on a wing and a prayer  
I must have been born with a hole in my head

Never, never, never say never

Better, better believe in forever

What'cha going to do when the sun goes down tonight  
You'll hit the same old clubs, rap that same old trash  
That's right  
You've got them real silk shirts and them baggy pants  
Dago shoes in the colors that match  
But the girls are acting bored  
And you're feeling like you're going to lose  
You've got the G.Q. Blues

Been doing the same damn job for ten long years this May

You've been working and saving for your Jamaican dream  
Paradise is waiting across the sea  
But when your plane lands Montego turns to Monsoon  
You've got the Island Blues  
  
'Cause, nothing ever goes as planned  
It's a hell of a notion  
Even Pharaohs turn to sand  
Like a drop in the ocean  
You're so together and you act so civilized  
But every time that things go wrong you're still surprised  
You've done your duty, you've paid a fortune in dues  
Still got those Mother Nature's Blues  
  
I strut around the stage like a little king tonight  
They'll scream for every word and every note, that's right  
But when the show is over and I'm all alone  
Can't reach my baby on the telephone  
And everywhere I look Mr. Loneliness is in the news  
I've got the Big Star Blues  
  
Boy, nothing ever goes as planned  
It's a hell of a notion  
Even Pharaohs turn to sand  
Like a drop in the ocean

Spreading out like a corn field

Start over again

So good  
So high tonight  
  
Starting tonight  
There will be  
A revival  
In my world  
  
Turn on the lights  
And you'll see  
This one man band  
Is now a symphony  
  
And the sun  
Is gonna shine  
Like a summer time  
That has no end  
  
And the love  
I will find  
I have no doubt  
That it will be mine  
The love I find  
Will all be mine

I could still be saved  
Let a new day come  
Stop digging my grave

The road up ahead  
Gonna get much easier

But now this emptiness haunts me every day  
We seek the lion's share never knowing why

Don't cash your freedoms in for gold

And I will lie within your arms

Wishing secretly you were a star.

They show you photographs of how your life should be  
But they're just someone else's fantasy

Because you never win the game  
Just remember that it's a Grand illusion

And the comrades that I've lost out there

But the voices of the friends they heard  
Brought them back to this reality

Most disturbing  
Quite unnerving

To be free  
Terminally  
  
We'll fly to a spot

Any sorrow  
No tomorrow  
  
People just laugh  
Cause they know how it feels  
To have loved  
And be loved  
  
Don't you worry  
Ain't no need to hurry  
All you really need  
Is love  
  
Bah bah bah bah bah

Tell me more of this place

Listen my friends  
Carefully to direction  
To get there  
And you know where  
  
Love is the place  
Skewed to matter and space  
For us all  
For us all  
  
Don't you worry  
Ain't no need to hurry  
All you really need  
Is love, love, love

older men are chosen to speak wisely

"Once a peaceful man laid his old head down by a river,  
Thought about his childhood life, his father and forgiver,  
Couldn't hide away, hide away.  
  
He controlled the horses with a hand clap or a whisper,  
Drink he couldn't combat but he knew he was no sinner,  
Couldn't hide away, hide away.  
  
He told all his sons of all the antics of adventure,  
Then he told another one who drove himself to drink  
Not to hide away, hide away.  
  
Better men have realized alone is not a venture,  
A decent man would realize alone is not a venture,  
Just to hide away, hide away.  
  
He told all his sons of all the antics of adventure,  
Then he told another one who drove himself to drink  
Not to hide away, hide away.

"The day the Circus of Heaven came to town  
Local folks lined the streets in a Midwestern town  
Waiting anxiously for the parade to begin all around  
On the very last day  
  
A unicorn headed the mystical way  
Surrounded by what seemed a thousand golden angels at play  
Behind were Centaurs, elves, bright fairies all in colors of jade  
On the very final day  
  
For what seemed only just a moment in time  
Seven solemn flying silvered regal horses rode by  
Seven golden chariots in tow, a wonder to behold  
The Seven Lords of the Mountains of Time  
There then arose where nothing really stood there before  
A giant tent rising one thousand feet high from the floor  
Towns people flocked inside with their eyes all amazed  
To greet the Seventh Lord of the seventh age  
A fanfare rang out in an incredible sound  
Bringing out the strangest visions perfect harmony round  
Any dreams he asked would they like to have seen  
From historical or mythical scenes  
  
Then there above their heads just as vivid as life  
Each vision transported multitudes inventing light  
Grecian galleons, the sack of Troy, to the Gardens of Babylon  
A play of millions roared along  
The gigantic dreams of Alexander the Great  
Civil wars where brothers fought and killed their friendship with hate  
All seen by Zeus performing scenes in the magical way  
The day the circus came to town  
  
Outside great animals as tame as the trees  
Angels high in starlight dancing streets  
Turning their colors with indigo and gold  
Dropping violet, red and emerald snow  
As the circus finally changed its invisible course  
A new world to be found  
  
On the dreamy ground we walked upon  
I turned to my son and said  
""Was that something beautiful, amazing, wonderful, extraordinary  
beautiful?""  
  
""Oh! It was OK!! But there were no clowns, no tigers, lions or bears,  
cand-floss, toffee apples, no clowns.""

"A seasoned witch could call you from the depths of your disgrace,  
And rearrange your liver to the solid mental grace,  
And achieve it all with music that came quickly from afar,  
Then taste the fruit of man recorded losing all against the hour.  
And assessing points to nowhere, leading ev'ry single one.  
A dewdrop can exalt us like the music of the sun,  
And take away the plain in which we move,  
And choose the course you're running.  
  
Down at the edge, round by the corner,  
Not right away, not right away.  
Close to the edge, down by a river,  
Not right away, not right away.  
  
Crossed the line around the changes of the summer,  
Reaching out to call the color of the sky.  
Passed around a moment clothed in mornings faster than we see.  
Getting over all the time I had to worry,  
Leaving all the changes far from far behind.  
We relieve the tension only to find out the master's name.  
  
Down at the end, round by the corner.  
Close to the edge, just by a river.  
Seasons will pass you by.  
I get up, I get down.  
Now that it's all over and done,  
Now that you find, now that you're whole.  
  
My eyes convinced, eclipsed with the younger moon attained with love.  
It changed as almost strained amidst clear manna from above.  
I crucified my hate and held the word within my hand.  
There's you, the time, the logic, or the reasons we don't understand.  
  
Sad courage claimed the victims standing still for all to see,  
As armoured movers took approached to overlook the sea.  
There since the cord, the license, or the reasons we understood will be.  
  
Down at the edge, close by a river.  
Close to the edge, round by the corner.  
Close to the end, down by the corner.  
Down at the edge, round by the river.  
  
Sudden problems shouldn't take away the startled memory.  
All in all, the journey takes you all the way.  
As apart from any reality that you've ever seen and known.  
Guessing problems only to deceive the mention,  
Passing paths that climb halfway into the void.  
As we cross from side to side, we hear the total mass retain.  
  
Down at the edge, round by the corner.  
Close to the end, down by a river.  
Seasons will pass you by.  
I get up, I get down.  
  
In her white lace, you could clearly see the lady sadly looking.  
Saying that she'd take the blame  
For the crucifixion of her own domain.  
  
I get up,  
I get down,  
I get up,  
I get down.  
  
Two million people barely satisfy.  
Two hundred women watch one woman cry, too late.  
The eyes of honesty can achieve.  
How many millions do we deceive each day?  
I get up, I get down.  
I get up, I get down.  
  
In charge of who is there in charge of me.  
Do I look on blindly and say I see the way?  
The truth is written all along the page.  
How old will I be before I come of age for you?  
I get up, I get down.  
I get up, I get down.  
I get up, I get down.  
  
The time between the notes relates the color to the scenes.  
A constant vogue of triumphs dislocate man, it seems.  
And space between the focus shape ascend knowledge of love.  
As song and chance develop time, lost social temp'rance rules above.  
Ah, ah.  
  
Then according to the man who showed his outstretched arm to space,  
He turned around and pointed, revealing all the human race.  
I shook my head and smiled a whisper, knowing all about the place.  
On the hill we viewed the silence of the valley,  
Called to witness cycles only of the past.  
And we reach all this with movements in between the said remark.  
  
Close to the edge, down by the river.  
Down at the end, round by the corner.  
Seasons will pass you by,  
Now that it's all over and done,  
Called to the seed, right to the sun.  
Now that you find, now that you're whole.  
Seasons will pass you by,  
I get up, I get down.  
I get up, I get down.  
I get up, I get down.  
I get up.

Songs cast alight on you. All pure chance.  
Hark through dark ties. As exists cross divided.  
That tunnel us out of sane existence. In all encircling mode.  
In challenge as direct. Oh closely guided plan.  
As eyes see young stars assemble. Awaken in our heart.  
  
Master of soul. Master of time.  
Set to touch. Setting sail.  
All impenetrable youth. Over all of our lands.  
Ask away. And as we look.

With all that's clear. Shall we now bid.  
Be honest with yourself. Farewell, farewell.

"Never underestimate the loving  
How we intertwine our very soul  
How we fill each other's spaces to lose control  
When you're talking, be the children  
Who stand on solid ground  
Never underestimate the giving that will bring you around  
  
I'll be there, to bring this love in the morning  
I'll be there, to bring you the stars at night  
I'll be there, just waiting to hear you singing  
  
Never underestimate a giver  
The gift of love will surely be  
When you're asking for the secrets to set you free  
When you're talking to the friendship  
That love of higher self  
This gift of love is the answer to all your doubts  
  
Be the one, giving in to love  
Never let the good in life desert you  
Be the one, giving in to love  
Never let the fools destroy your dreams  
Be the one, giving in to love  
I can dream myself every minute  
So how did we become, masters of limitation?  
  
I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there  
To make it right for you  
  
Giving in, giving in to love  
It's the balance of this everyday feeling  
Giving in, giving in to love  
Without love our dreams become illusion  
Giving in, giving in to love  
I can hear you singing every minute  
So you can sing the song, and see the truth  
  
So we worked all around amidst the glory of life  
Any fire of the flame would be made  
Should the famine of change to disguise everyone  
Who cannot see the soul of truth ready made  
But all because we're changing now  
As the prophets of doom speak their mind  
It's a long, long way from where mankind began  
It's a long, long way humankind  
  
So we dance down on nature as we try to repeat  
All our efforts as one sent today  
Taking back instead of giving, taking back more or less  
Taking back a sense of being afraid  
So all this necessary changes now, as the will to help all man  
And the children of the crucified will better off, better dead  
  
But all this senseless killing, and all these chains and lies  
I want to know right now, I want to know right now  
I want to know where we come from  
For it's a long, long way from where the system began  
It's a long, long way humankind  
It's a long, long way from where the system began  
It's a long, long way humankind, yea  
  
Giving in, giving in to love  
I can see and feel the truth every minute  
Giving in, giving in to love  
Be the one to rescue you, rescue you  
Giving in, giving in to love  
There's no way that you can live without it  
So we can become, masters of our invention

I can see and feel the truth every minute

Be the one to rescue you, rescue you

Swaying branches breaking sound, lonely forest trembling ground.

Time, like gold dust, brings mind down to hidden levels underground,  
Say a few words to the wind, that's all that's left of winter's friend.  
  
Reaching the snow in the days of the cold, casting a spell out of ice.

High time flying

I want to know right now is  
This the state of play

And their gods sought out and conquered, Ah Kin  
Do the leaves of green stay greener through the autumn  
Does the colour of the sun turn crimson white  
Does a shadow come between us in the winter  
Is the movement really light  
And I heard a million voices singing  
Acting to the story that they had heard about  
Does on child know the secret and can say it  
Or does it all come out along without you  
along without you  
along without you  
Where does reaon stop and killing just take over  
Does a lamb cry out before we shoot it dead  
Are there many more in comfort understanding  
Is the movement in the head

"Dawn of light lying between a silence and sold sources,  
Chased amid fusions of wonder  
In moments hardly seen forgotten,  
Coloured in pastures of chance  
Dancing leaves cast spells of  
Challenge,  
Amused but real in thought,  
We fled from the sea whole.  
Dawn of thought transferred through moments of days underseaarching  
Earth  
Revelaing corridors of time, provoking memories,  
Disjointed but with purpose,  
Craving penetrations offer links with the self-instructors sharp  
And tender love  
As we took to the air, a picture of distance.  
Dawn of our power we amuse redescending as fast as misused  
Expression,  
As only to teach love as to reveal passion chasing  
Late into corners,  
And we danced from the ocean.  
Dawn of love sent within us colours of awakening among the many  
Won't to follow,  
Only tunes of a different age.  
As the links span our endless caresses for the freedom of life  
Everlasting.

"Existence is a stage on which we pass  
a sleepwalk trick for mind and heart:  
it's hopeless, I know,  
but onward I must go  
and try to make a start  
at seeing something more than day to day  
survival, chased by final death  
if I believed this the sum  
of the life to which we've come,  
I wouldn't waste my breath  
Somehow, there must be more. There was a time  
when more was felt than known  
but now, entrenched inside my sett,  
in light more mundane,  
thought rattles round my brain:  
we live, we die...and yet?  
  
In the beginning there was order and destiny  
but now that path has reached the border,  
and on our knees  
is no way to face the future, whatever it be.  
Though the forces which hold us in place  
last through eons in unruffled grace  
we, too, wear the face of creation.  
  
As anti-matter sucks and pulses periodically  
the bud unfolds, the bloom is dead,  
all space is living history.  
It seems as though time must betray us,  
yet we're alive  
and though I see no God to save us,  
yetl we survive  
through the centuries of progress  
which don't get us very far.  
All illusion! All is bogus -  
we don't yet know what we are...  
Laughing, hoping, praying, joking, Son of Man!  
with lowered eyes but lifting hearts,  
we're grains of sand  
and though, in time, the sea  
may claim us for its own  
we are the rocks which root the future -  
on us it grows!  
  
We might not be there to share it  
if eternity's a jest  
but I think that I can bear it  
if the next life is the best.  
Even if there is a heaven when we die,  
endless bliss would be as meaningless as the lie  
that always comes as answer to the question,  
""Why do we see through the eyes of creation?""  
  
Adrift without a course,  
it's very lonely here,  
our only conjecture  
what lies behind the dark.  
Still, I find I can cling to a lifeline,  
think of a lifetime which means more  
than my own one -  
dreams of a grander thing than we are.  
Time and Space hang heavy on my shoulders:  
when all life is over who can say  
no mutated force shall remain?  
Though the towers of the city are denied  
to we men of clay  
still we know we shall scale  
the heights some day.  
Frightened in the silence -  
frightened, but thinking very hard,  
let us make computations of the stars.  
  
Older, wiser, sadder, blinder, watch us run:  
faster, longer, harder, stronger, now it comes:  
colour blisters, image splinters gravitate  
towards the centre, in final splendour disintegrate,  
The universe now beckons  
and Man, too, must take His place...  
just a few last fleeting seconds  
to wander in the waste,  
and the children who were ourselves move on,  
reincarnation stills its now perfected song,  
and at last we are free of the bonds of creation.  
  
All the jokers and gaolers, all the junkies  
and slavers too,  
all the throng who have danced a merry tune -  
human we can all be,  
but Humanity we must rise above,  
in the name of all faith and hope and love.  
There's a time for all pilgrims,  
and a time for the fakers too,  
there's a time when we all will stand alone  
and nude,  
naked to the galaxies -  
naked, but clothed in the overview...  
as we reach Childhood's End we must start anew.  
  
And though dark is the highway,  
and the peak's distance breaks my heart,  
for I never shall see it, still I play my part,  
believing that what waits for us  
is the cosmos compared to the dust of the past...  
In the death of mere humans life shall start

"He's a blind man, crouching by the pavement  
only seeing with his third eye  
and clutching at the astral shadow  
of every passer-by  
  
He's a wise man, trumping all the answers  
she's a wild girl, trying to keep his feet on the floor  
in whispered physical litanies  
""Stay away from the door.""  
  
""Oh, but we're all in this together,"" he says  
""three-legged race across the floor  
if only you'd loosen the handkerchief  
then I'd forget the door.""  
  
""Ooh, that feels so much better,"" he says  
""now you forget everything that I've said before  
and sit there all by yourself  
while I walk through the door.""  
  
They're a blind man, crouching by the pavement,  
only seeing with his third eye  
and clutching at the astral shadow  
of the door of a room  
called 'I'

"The killer lives inside me: I can feel him move.  
Sometimes he's lightly sleeping in the quiet of his room,  
But then his eyes will rise and stare through mine,  
He'll speak my words and slice my mind inside.  
  
The killer lives.  
  
The angels live inside me: I can feel them smile,  
Their presence strokes and soothes the tempest in my mind  
And their love can heal the wounds that I have wrought.  
They watch me as I go to fall, well, I know I shall be caught,  
  
For the angels live.  
  
How can I be free?  
How can I get help?  
Am I really me?  
Am I someone else?  
  
But stalking in my cloisters hang the acolytes of gloom  
And Death's Head throws his cloak onto the corner of my room and I am doomed,  
But laughing in my courtyard play the pranksters of my youth  
And solemn, waiting Old Man in the gables of the roof, he tells me truth  
  
And I, too, live inside me and very often don't know who I am,  
I know, I'm not a hero, I hope that I'm not damned  
I'm just a man, and killers, angels, all are these,  
Dictators, saviors, refugees  
In war and peace  
As long as Man lives  
  
I'm just a man, and killers, angels, all are these,  
Dictators, saviors, refugees

"If I'm the mirror and you're the image  
Then what's the secret between the two  
These me's and you's, how many can there be  
Oh, I don't mind all that around the place  
As long as you keep it  
Well away from me  
  
I've begun to regret that we ever met  
Between the dimensions  
It gets such a strain to pretend that the change  
Is anything but cheap  
With your infant pique and your angst pretensions  
Sometimes you act like a creep  
  
And now I'm standing in the corner  
Looking at the room and the furniture  
In cheap imitation of alienation and grief  
And now we're going to the kitchen  
Fix ourselves a drink and a cigarette  
Getting no closer to being the joker or thief  
  
Still, I reflect, this nervous wreck  
Who stands before me can see as well  
Can surely tell that he's not yet free  
He can turn aside, but can no more ignore me  
Than know which one of us is he  
Than tell what we are going to be  
Than know which one of is me  
  
And now we're going to the kitchen  
Fix ourselves a drink and a cigarette  
Getting no closer to being the joker or thief  
  
These mirror images  
These mirror images  
Won't stay, go away, are no help  
  
In these mirror images of myself  
There are no secrets

"At night, this mindless army, ranks unbroken by dissent,  
Is moved into action and their pace does not relent.  
In step, with great precision, these dancers of the night  
Advance against the darkness - how implacable their might!  
Eyes undulled by moon, their arms and legs akimbo,  
They walk and live, hoping soon to surface from this limbo.  
Their minds, anticipating the dawn of the day,  
Shall never know what's waiting mere insight away  
Too far, too soon.  
  
Senses dimmed in semi-sentience, only wheeling through this plane,  
Only seeing fragmented images prematurely curtailed by the brain,  
But breathing, living, knowing in some measure at least  
The soul which roots the matter of both Beauty and the Beast.  
From what tooth or claw does murder spring,  
From what flesh and blood does passion?  
Both cut through the air with the pendulum's swing  
In deadly but delicate fashion.  
And every range of feeling is there in the dream  
And every logic's reeling in the force of the scream  
The senses sting.  
And though I may be dreaming and reality stalls  
I only know the meaning of sight and that's all  
And that's nothing.  
  
The columns of the night advance,  
Infectiously, their cryptic dance  
Gathers converts to the fold -  
In time the whole raw world will pace these same steps  
On into the same bitter end.  
  
Somnolent muster now the dancing dead  
Forsake the shelter of their secure beds,  
Awaken to a slumber whose depths they dread,  
As if the ground they tread would give way  
Beneath the solemn weight of their conception.  
I'd search the hidden corners of all this world,  
Make reason of the sensory whorl  
If I only had time,  
But soon the dream is ended.  
  
Tonight, before you lay down to the sweetness of your sleep  
Do you question your surrender to the drop from Lover's Leap  
Or does the anaesthetic darkness take hold on its very own?  
Does your body rise in service with not one dissenting groan?  
These waking dreams of life and death  
In the mirror are twisted and buckled,  
Lashes flicker, a catch of breath,  
Skin whitening at the knuckles.  
The army of sleepwalkers shake their limbs and are loose  
And though I am a talker, I can phrase no excuse  
Not to rise again.  
In the chorus of the night-time I belong  
And I, like you, must dance to that moonlight song  
And in the end I too must pay the cost of this life.  
If all is lost none is known  
And how could we lose what we've never owned?  
Oh, I'd search out every knowledge that I could find,  
Unravel all the mysteries of mind,  
If I only had time,  
If I only had time,  
But soon my time is ended.
