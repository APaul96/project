Cause what if I never love again?

I don't need your honesty  
It's already in your eyes and I'm sure my eyes, they speak for me  
No one knows me like you do  
And since you're the only one that matters, tell me who do I run to?

"Found myself today singing out your name,  
You said I'm crazy,  
If I am I'm crazy for you.  
  
Sometimes sitting in the dark wishing you were here  
Turns me crazy,  
But it's you who makes me lose my head.  
  
And every time I'm meant to be acting sensible  
You drift into my head  
And turn me into a crumbling fool.  
  
Tell me to run and I'll race,  
If you want me to stop I'll freeze,  
And if you want me gone. I'll leave, just hold me closer baby,  
And make me crazy for you.  
Crazy for you.  
  
Lately with this state I'm in I can't help myself but spin.  
I wish you'd come over,  
Send me spinning closer to you.  
  
My oh my, how my blood boils, it's sweet taste for you,  
Strips me down bare  
And gets me into my favorite mood.  
  
I keep on trying, fighting these feelings away,  
But the more I do,  
The crazier I turn into.  
  
Pacing floors and opening doors,  
Hoping you'll walk through  
And save me boy,  
Because I'm too crazy for you.  
Crazy for you

"Daydreamer  
Sitting on the sea  
Soaking up the sun  
He is a real lover  
And making up the past  
Feeling up his girl  
Like he's never felt a figure before  
  
A jaw dropper  
Looks good when he walks  
Is the subject of their talk  
He would be hard to chase  
But good to catch  
And he could change the world  
With his hands behind his back, oh  
  
You can find him sittin' on your doorstep  
Waiting for a surprise  
And he will feel like he's been there for hours  
And you can tell that he'll be there for life  
  
Daydreamer  
With eyes that make you melt  
He lends his coat for shelter  
Plus he's there for you  
When he shouldn't be  
But he stays all the same  
Waits for you  
Then sees you through  
  
There's no way I  
Could describe him  
What I'll say is  
Just what I'm hoping for  
  
But I will find him sittin' on my doorstep

Since I felt safe in somebody's arms, em em  
You were a good friend I could confide in  
But after all the lies he told me  
I couldn't let nobody in my heart  
I was torn apart  
All this time you've been right here  
He's been doing nothing but wrong

Here with me all along

Turning it to  
The kind of heaven that I never Knew  
  
He kissed away my tears  
And now they've disappeared  
You make me feel safe in somebody's arms  
You're the kind that can do me no harm  
These questions everybody asks me  
They say they've never seen me so happy  
But that's a secret between you and me  
They don't know nothing about us baby  
Can't let up  
Can't tell anybody that you're not from around here  
They don't know that you're an angel  
But now it's all so clear  
  
I never knew  
Right beside me there was an angel  
I never knew  
You'd give my heart the wings to fly  
Because of you  
Everything in my life is changing  
Turning it to  
The kind of heaven that I never Knew  
  
Is this a dream  
Are you for real  
You got me honey  
Feeling things that I never thought I'd feel  
You taught me love  
Don't have to break my heart in two  
That's just one more of those things  
That I never, never knew  
  
I never knew  
Right beside me  
There was an angel  
I never, never knew (that my heart could fly)

Not to fall apart  
Kept trying hard to mend  
The pieces of my broken heart

I used to cry  
Now I hold my head up high  
And you see me  
  
Somebody new  
I'm not that chained up little girl  
Who fell in love with you  
And so you felt like dropping in  
And just expect me to be free

In all our trials born to be our friend.  
  
Truly He taught us to love one another  
His law is love and His gospel is peace  
Chains shall He break for the slave is our brother  
And in His name all oppression shall cease  
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we,  
Let all within us praise His holy name.

You're goin left and I'm goin right  
It's crazy

They say that dreams they sometimes do come true  
  
Your star shines so bright  
You're the queen of my night  
In the daytime not quite  
But I'm so glad that I  
  
Can dream dream dream

Like lovers do  
And it might come true

The only time  
That I'll be with you  
  
But I'll dream dream dream

Of you

You showed me out of sight.  
When we go home late tonight.  
  
Girl we gon' do it right right.  
Until the daylight.  
We'll do it light right.  
Yes, we'll do it all night.  
Don't look at the time.  
Just let it fly by.  
Yes, we'll live the good life.  
And we'll do it right right.  
Then we say bye bye.  
  
Then we say bye bye

Bye bye

"[Verse 1: John Legend]  
All this trouble in this here town  
All this shit going down  
When will they focus, on this?  
Streets ride up with the TV crews  
Look ma, we on the news  
But they didn't notice, before this  
They float above the city lights  
Forget the truth, inhale the lies  
Just enjoy the show  
They see us reaching for the sky  
Just in order to survive  
  
[Chorus: John Legend]  
Maybe we should go  
Go to the penthouse floor (let's go, let's go, let's go)  
Go to the penthouse floor (let's go, let's go, let's go)  
Let's ride the elevator, they can't keep us out no more  
Go to the penthouse floor (let's go, let's go, let's go)  
Penthouse floor  
  
[Verse 2: John Legend]  
All that bubbly, all that wine  
Oh man, look at the times  
Didn't they notice, notice?  
Only future I can see, ain't what it used to be  
And I didn't know this, I didn't know this  
Once you're above the city lights  
Won't want to spend another night, down there on your own  
The holding on is made for us  
The altitude is dangerous, but we ain't going home  
  
[Chorus: John Legend]  
Go to the penthouse floor (let's go, let's go, let's go)  
Go to the penthouse floor (let's go, let's go, let's go)  
Let's ride the elevator, it's what we've been waiting for  
Can't keep us out no more (let's go, let's go, let's go)  
Penthouse floor  
  
[Verse 3: Chance The Rapper]  
I heard this old joke once, it was like, uh  
Knock knock, who there, it's us, us who?  
Just us, who dis? Just playin'  
Just me, new phone, new hair, new era  
I'm in the penthouse, baby  
Handpicked from bad apples and bad eggs  
Held back, I had to grab crab legs  
And then there were only but a few  
Conversations held with patience, what a party, what a view  
What a dress, what a song  
What a beautiful time  
My folks downstairs still waitin' in line  
They never been in these rooms  
Never stayed with these folks  
Never laughed at the news, never hated these jokes  
So as I fly in my suit, in a group, undercover  
Forcin' a new smile, he tells me another  
He said ""What happened to the boy that climbed up the trunk?""  
Then he pushed me off the top and said ""Jump, nigga, jump!""  
  
[Bridge: John Legend]  
Oh, don't bring me down, I need a room in the clouds  
I wanna get there babe, I wanna elevate  
Oh my favorite mix, a little ignorance and bliss  
In the penthouse babe, go to the penthouse  
  
[Chorus: John Legend]  
Go to the penthouse floor (let's go, let's go, let's go)  
Go to the penthouse floor (let's go, let's go, let's go)  
Let's ride the elevator, it's what we've been waiting for  
We'll tear down those penthouse doors (let's go, let's go, let's go)  
Those penthouse doors  
We'll tear down the penthouse doors (let's go, let's go, let's go)  
Baby, I'm in the penthouse floor  
Baby, let's ride the elevator  
Til we can rise some more  
Go to the penthouse floor, penthouse floor (let's go, let's go, let's go)

Please baby don't (baby don't)  
Don't fall in love with me  
  
I've been cruisin down this road for a while now,  
I should tell the truth...  
Girl you've been so good to me but I know  
I'm no good for you  
You should run while you can  
Find yourself a better man  
'Cause I'm known for brief romance  
And breakin hearts across the land  
  
Yes I've been known to have a few temptations  
Out there on the road  
And let's say hypothetically I've slipped and  
Took a couple home  
Girl I know that's not fair  
You need someone who'll be there  
So just get away before it's too late  
And you're pain is too much to bear  
  
Please baby don't (baby don't)  
Don't fall in love with me  
Please baby don't (baby don't)  
You know my history

I'm just trying to warn you (let me warn you)  
Please baby don't (baby don't)  
Don't fall in love with me  
  
Now on second thought maybe we'll give  
This love another try  
'Cause I can't see you with no one else  
I'm selfish I can't lie  
So let's go, let's go slow  
You know all you need to know  
It could end one day but  
Let's just say we'll see how far it goes  
  
Please baby don't (baby don't)  
Don't fall in love with me  
Please baby don't (baby don't)  
You know my history

"I pray for better days to come  
I pray that I would see the sun  
Cuz life is so burdensome  
When everyday's a rainy one  
  
But suddenly there's no more clouds  
I believe without a doubt  
That heaven sent an angel down  
And then she turned my life around  
  
You know and I know  
Friends come and friends go  
Storms rise and winds blow  
But one thing I know for sure  
  
When it's cold outside  
There's no need to worry cuz  
I'm so warm inside  
You give me peace  
When the storm's outside  
Cuz we're in love I know  
It'll be alright  
Alright it's alright  
  
Oooh...  
  
Now peace is so hard to find  
We're terrorized and victimized  
But that's when I close my eyes  
And think of you to ease my mind  
You take me to another place  
There's no more war (no more war)  
Just love and grace  
Baby you restore my faith  
I know the struggle's not in vain  
You know and I know  
Through all the battles  
Baghdad to Israel  
There's one thing I know for sure  
  
When it's cold outside  
There's no need to worry cuz  
I'm so warm inside  
You give me peace  
When the storm's outside  
Cuz we're in love I know  
It'll be alright

It'll be alright  
Alright it's alright

In the middle of the storm  
When it's cold you're keeping me warm  
It's alright

I'm never gonna leave  
You give me what I need  
It's alright, alright

"[Verse 1]  
Will you live like me, in a world run by desire?  
Will you wake from worldly dream and not be tired?  
Will you work like me to lift the conversation higher?  
Will you be cool like water putting out the fire?  
How can you be free from all this sorrow?  
Will the ones you love today be gone tomorrow?  
  
[Chorus 1]  
And if angels don't have answers to your prayers  
Oh, I will be there, oh I will be there  
  
[Verse 2]  
And if who you love don't want your love, well then...  
Do you cut a deal with love and run again?  
You see, love contains the meaning of despair  
Will you think like me? Will you have your mother's fire?  
Maybe the way we are will not be how you're wired  
Will we do right by you? Will we you have what you require  
To make your days on this Earth be not so dire?  
  
[Chorus 2]  
Can you choose to lead if no one follows?  
And if we fell today, must you tomorrow?  
Sanctify your answer not your prayer  
Oh, I will be there, yeah, I will be there  
Yeah, I will be there  
  
[Outro]  
And even when it all becomes too much  
When you're growing old and feeling out of touch  
Listen to this song and just take care  
And know that I will be there, yeah, I will be there  
No, I swear that I will, yeah, I promise I will  
Little girl, I'm cryin'

I was born at the end of december  
Not afraid that the cold of the winter  
Would keep me inside, hey  
Ever since mama left me at home  
I had to search for a class of my own  
And go there in my mind  
  
I had a dream like dr. King  
I had a song I had to sing  
And I knew it wasn't make believe  
When the teacher said to me  
Baby, who do you wanna be  
Said I don't know but I know that I'm a gonna leave  
  
I'm so gone (just you)  
All I do is walk alone (just me)  
I'm so gone (just you)  
I can make it on my own (just me)  
Alright  
  
Everybody wanna follow the crowd  
But I belong in the front singing loud  
And I'll go solo, hey  
But the fame is a hell of a temptress  
Not my wife but I guess she's a mistress, oh  
Can I let her go  
  
She can play tricks on your mind  
Have you leave your soul behind  
She's turned some niggas out  
But she can't keep her spell on me  
She can't keep back mailing me  
I'm free to leave, to be just me  
  
I'm so gone (just you)  
All I do is walk alone (just me)  
I'm so gone (just you)  
I can make it on my own (just me)  
  
So many (so many people tryna be somebody else)  
Tryna be somebody else (or whatever sells)  
I've got my own lane (I've got my own lane, I'm driving by myself)  
Hope you wish my well  
  
I'm so gone (just you)  
All I do is walk alone (just me)  
I'm so gone (just you)  
I can make it on my own (just me)  
  
I'm so gone (just you)  
All I do is walk alone (just me)  
I'm so gone (just you)  
I can make it on my own (just me)

Oh cause I only got myself to blame

My hands are here to mend what is broken  
  
To feel again the warmth of your face

We love, we love, we love the stars  
We could fall so hard  
The drinks, the minks, the jewels, the house, the cars  
Why'd we ball so hard?  
Yeah, and I, I'm not afraid to fly  
Here we are, in the air, barely breathing  
And we're not afraid to die  
  
Who do we think we are?  
Baby, tell me, who do we think we are?  
Who do we think we are?  
Baby, tell me, who do we think we are?  
  
We've got a lot of nerve, girl  
We walk around here like we own this place  
  
See my jewels dripping on my Timberlands  
Stepping like a criminal, success is so imminent  
Pink champagne, black Rolls Royce  
Eggplant double-breasted suit from Tom Ford  
Bon voyage, left haters in the fog  
Look up in the sky, bet you recognize a boss  
Look into my eyes as I fantasize for us  
Still actin' shy like this is summer class crush  
Money comin' fast, I'm never in a rush, no  
Plus another twenty in a tuck  
Semi in a truck, another forty on the wrist  
Quarter-mill on my mind got me livin' like I pitch  
Dodging Robin Givens, boiling like I'm Roger Clemens  
Still in the game, uniform all linen  
She get Chanel, ski trips to Vail  
Only the highest grade, like trees that I inhale  
  
And I, I'm not afraid to fly  
Here we are, in the air, barely breathing  
And we're not afraid to die  
Who do we think we are?  
Baby, tell me, who do we think we are?  
Who do we think we are?  
Oh baby, tell me, who do we think we are?  
  
Who do we think we are?  
I don't know about y'all, but I feel good tonight  
There's something in the air tonight  
You know, everyone needs someone to look up to  
Why shouldn't it be us?  
Who do we think we are?  
Tell me, who do we think we are?  
Who do we think we are?  
Tell me, who do we think we are?

I guess that's why I was drawn to you  
Second time leads to the third, the fifth, the seventh time

You said it would end, but here it goes again and again and again  
  
Damn, I love you, but this is crazy  
I have to fight you, almost daily  
We break up so fast and we, we make up so passionately  
Why can't we just trust each other?  
You can't hate me and be my lover  
Passion ends, the pain begins  
I come back, and we're doing it again  
  
Yes, we're doing it again  
Oh, we're doing it again  
We said it would end  
But here it goes again  
  
Each time you call me home in a sweet refrain,  
Saying ""things'll change,"" you'll take away the pain  
Then we flash back to the first time you put your spell on me  
You envelop me, you feel good as hell to me  
One moment leads to another few  
Here it goes again  
Leaving you is oh so hard to do  
I just can't pretend...can't pretend  
  
I keep doing it again  
Oh, I'm doing it again

But to understand that is to know reality  
Ah don't give in (hang on in there)  
Ah I said hang on (hang on in there)  
  
How many times did you hear your mom and daddy?  
Say oh child I never had it so good  
I wanna say thank you, thank you for the start  
Cause deep in my soul, I know you did all that you could  
I'm just a part of your dreams this I know  
But I'll do what ever possible to make this thing grow.  
Ah don't give in (hang on in there)  
I said hang on (hang on in there)  
  
Ah now say tomorrow if you woke up a king  
Now tell me just how would you fix everything?  
You walk around complaining about how things are  
But what have you added to this world so far  
Check out your mind, and see what the answer is  
And tell me how much did you give  
Ah don't give in (hang on in there)  
I said hang on, hang on in there (hang on in there)  
  
There are plenty of things still left to live for  
A child, a friend, and a wife  
They all want to share your life.  
Ain't that enough to make you want hang on  
Hang on, hang on (hang on in there)

""America, love it or leave""

She looked as sweet as honeydew  
You should've seen the way she walked away

You shoud've seen the way he kissed her lips  
Did it have the same sweet taste?

Feed them and raised them  
Seasons are aging  
Earthquakes, wars, and rumors  
I want us to get by but

Only love love love can reboot us

She could be the reason for my joy and my pain  
The first thing I see each morning, last thing I see at night

That's all I wish for in my life  
  
Why did she have to go  
What do I say to find her

This should be about love, not money  
Don't let him try to take you from me  
I don't want to have to apologize  
I don't want to feel I've been penalized  
Just 'cause I can drive in a better car  
Live in a bigger house just like a superstar  
He says that I can only give you  
Material things, but that's not true  
You see my heart is rich with love for you  
Don't let him make you doubt my love for you  
Yeah, baby  
I work hard for my money  
No one gave it to me

Look at all the lovin' we do  
Find the meaning in the words I'm sayin'  
I'm not just another player playin'  
I don't want to have to apologize (or give a damn)  
And I don't appreciate being criticized (for who I am)

He wants you to believe that I'm tryin' to buy your love  
'Cause that's what he would do  
He thinks since he's a man with nothing  
That he's got better love for you  
No way  
Tell him now, let him go  
Or I can no longer be yours  
Tell him how you feel about me  
I can't keep standing on the side  
Don't let him fill your mind with lies about me  
Leave him with his fallacies  
I don't care what bull he believes  
Tell him that enough is enough  
Just don't return a disbeliever  
You've always been a willing receiver of my love  
I don't think I have to apologize (I work for this)  
I don't want to feel like I'm penalized (for being rich)  
Doesn't bother me where he thinks I stand  
I'm bein' my true self  
Just doin' what I can  
He thinks I won you with materiality  
But honey, you know that's not so  
And even if he understood me  
It's simply time for him to go, so let him go!  
I don't want to change you  
'Cause I'm in love with who you are  
So I don't want to apologize for bein' a superstar  
Haven't I proved that I'm here for you?  
What am I guilty of?  
What did or didn't I do?  
Maybe I can't be myself with somebody  
Who believes such things are true  
I'm losing self-respect from trying  
I'm losing my desire too I can't do it

"Love, what have you done? Oh, wow.  
I was sure up to now that she was a friend.  
I stayed till the end. Don't be a fool again.  
I once believed that love was fair.  
But I don't anymore. She said I'm a bore.

I tell myself it's the game of love.  
Ignore the signs and risk it all in the name of love.  
Well, I've decided I can't let nobody hurt me again.  
So I'll say to the end  
I just don't want to be a fool. (Don't want to be a fool.)  
Said I don't want to be a fool ever again.  
  
Whenever a fool's in love he doesn't know he's to blame.  
He's caught in the game. It all ends up the same.  
He doesn't feel the shame. He looks at love in a diff'rent way.  
It breaks his heart ev'rytime they all turn out strange.  
  
But he'll never change. He's never gonna change.  
Next time around I'll tell myself it'll be better than before  
I won't look back.  
There'll be no one tearing my heart out anymore.  
I just decided I can't let nobody fool me again.  
So I'll swear to the end.  
I just don't want to be a fool. (Don't want to be a fool.)  
Said I don't want to be a fool (ever again)  
No way, (I mean no more) Never again (Oo, no never)  
I can't be a fool, can't be. No way. No way. No way. Oo.  
I don't want to be. I don't want to be a fool. No.  
I can't love anybody (I can't love nobody)  
walking on a one way street. (Any way, any way any, way no.)  
If I don't (If I don't) find somebody (somebody body )  
that'll be alright with me. (know, I know it'll be alright now)

Ever ever again. Don't want to be a fool Can't be a fool.

"There's a party in Harlem, come on  
  
I like to reminisce about that night we kissed  
It was somewhere one night in Harlem  
The nights were hot and bright  
You could treat your honey right  
?Cause Sylvia's would burn all night  
  
The people there were really something  
(You know that's right)  
The music always kept us jumping  
And it used to knock me down  
When Smokey came to town  
(And the miracles, please)  
My favorite song was ""Tears Of A Clown"", oh yeah  
  
There ain't nothing like them nights in Harlem  
They really shake the funk up there  
Tonight I'm gonna stomp in Harlem  
And I'm gonna take my baby back  
To the heart of Harlem  
  
Big sister had a group  
And they'd sit out on the stoop  
And Lordy could they harmonize (Oh yeah)  
My cousin Joe could blow  
Just like the radio  
And he used to drove them ""B"" girls wild  
  
But when grandma started happy dancing  
(Oh, she gon' break somethin')  
She really turned the mother out  
I like the way they do it up in Harlem  
When there's a party up in Harlem  
That's what it's all about  
  
Ain't nothing like them nights in Harlem  
They never fake the funk up there  
I met my Cherie Amour in Harlem  
And tonight I'm gonna take her back to the 'pollo  
  
There's a party in Harlem  
They say that all the stars will be there  
Everyone is going to Harlem  
Harlem is a party and everybody's going there  
  
Follow me visually, ?cause I usually be all around  
Originally everybody headed uptown  
Finessing the fly way you ?cruisin in your car  
On the West Side to the highway, East Side D-R  
And yes, we are about to set it  
Forget it, I thought you knew  
The Apollo is where I had to go with my crew  
From BMW's to my daddy's Cadillac  
He had the sunroof top wit the diamond in the back  
Check the ambiance, the place a renaissance  
Who frontin' nonchalant up in the restaurant  
What you really really want, we grabbin' by the clutch  
Precise can flaunt with this and never too much  
It's such a love flow, high but natural  
The thug's a no-show, and drugs a no-no  
The only thing that they was shootin' was pool  
While Harlem nights was right, the party was cool  
  
Nothing like them nights in Harlem  
They really shake the funk up there  
Tonight I'm gonna stomp in Harlem  
I'm gonna take my baby back to the heart of Harlem  
  
Nights in Harlem  
They never fake the funk up there  
I met my Cherie Amour in Harlem  
Back to the Harlem Apollo  
  
Nights in Harlem  
They don't let you fake the funk up there  
Tonight I'm gonna stomp in Harlem  
I'm gonna take my honey  
Back to the Harlem Apollo  
  
Nights in Harlem  
They really shake the funk up there  
Tonight I'm gonna stomp in Harlem  
I'm gonna take my baby

Right from this heart of mine (I thought about you)

You don't know me, you're my private fantasy

Had a lovely day today (I thought about you)  
Wasn't hard to get through (I thought about you)  
Seems to happen easily  
Every time I think about you

"How many times can we say goodbye  
Steven Goldman  
(album: busy body - 1983)  
  
Duet with Dionne Warwick  
  
Here we are so close to the end now  
Still holding on we try and pretend now  
Clinging to love we both know is dying  
We've tried and tried to find us a way out  
But darling our dreams have now all been played out  
Still we go on hopelessly trying  
  
Chorus:  
But how many times can we say goodbye  
Hos many times can we see love die  
How many times can we give it one more try  
Before we really say goodbye  
  
We're so in love but wrong for each other  
Each hurt that heals brings on another  
Both of us used and both of us using  
Darling it's time that we stop pretending  
There's just no way to rewrite our ending  
We're caught in this game  
And we know we're both losing  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
Bridge:  
How many times can we break up and make up  
Both of our hearts refusing to wake up  
Just can't go on and on living a lie  
Though I'll always love you

"All of the band was on time for rehearsal

The show is selling out tonight  
Well, the lights went on and suddenly the crowd began to scream  
And as you could well imagine, it was like living a dream

"It was early Sunday morning  
Everyone in the house was still asleep  
She made some toast and coffee  
Took a shower and made herself smell sweet  
She said, ""I don't want a bus ride,  
I believe that the walk might help me think  
Got a heart kind of heavy  
I need some big hat and gloves, shoes and bag religion!""

Some of that ""make me feel better when I shout!!!"" religion

Papa Henry was full of spice  
He was a man usually nice  
But something got into him last night  
Made him want to fuss and holler  
The entire house was in a sweat  
His bottle got broken and the floor got wet  
""Clean it up!"" you could hear him scream  
Then he said, ""I'm going out""  
I need religion  
  
Religion  
That's my decision  
Some of that ""raise up the roof, 90 proof"" religion  
That's my decision  
Religion  
It's my decision, oh yes it is

It's the story about a good family

They are people who love their daughter and son  
They try to give them religion

"If you always do what you've always done, you'll always get the same old stuff  
Life can treat you good, then turn as cold as ice  
And believe me when I tell you  
  
This thing called love, for sure, is like most things in life  
Not all bad, not all good (it's just something that I believe)  
Not all cold, not all hot (yeah, I like that)  
Not all bitter, not all sweet (sounds all right to me)  
  
So don't miss all the good, waiting for the best, there's still happiness  
Right in the middle  
Perfect love sounds real nice  
But that never seemed to happen with any relationship of mine  
It was always up and down, in then out  
And after the last goodbye, I still didn't know what it was all about  
You get disappointed if it ain't bliss all the time  
  
And you get so annoyed if you can't feel the same every night  
Not all bad, not all good (I'm tryin' to tell you that it's)  
Not all high, not all low (not all high and not all low)  
Not all heaven, not all hell (as far as I can tell)  
  
It's not some prize you win, you don't have a thing to prove, just enjoy the
groove  
Right in the middle  
Cause I've learned when it comes to love, it's the exact same reality  
That's why they say ""Que sera, sera""  
Which means whatever's gonna be is gonna be  
  
Whatever's gonna be is gonna be:  
Not all bad, not all good (I need somebody to understand)  
Not all sunshine, not all rain  
(You know that too much of a good thing is really no good)  
Not all laughter, not all tears (I'm only trying to tell you)

Guess I'm to blame and it's just a shame  
Cause I had the chance to tell you what you meant  
But I lived my life thinking I had time  
And that in my mind I'd get to it  
  
Now you've gone away, not a single day goes by  
When I don't think about it  
Your spirit's all around, I can say it now  
I hope you hear this  
  
Now it's a shame that I found out the hard way  
And it ain't the same  
Cause you never ever got to hear me say  
That I love you, 'cause I waited too late  
So oh, I've got to tell everybody  
Don't make the same mistake

It's alright to say I love you out loud  
And it's all good, so don't you keep it inside  
Let it out, do it today  
No no no, don't you wait  
Cause it just might be too late  
To say I love you  
  
Don't walk a mile inside my shoes  
Cause if you do, you're gonna regret it  
Don't take it lightly thinking they might be  
Here or there tomorrow  
  
Why you want to wait, communicate  
Don't assume that they already know  
How much, how much you're really feeling  
And you really, really love them  
  
Now it's a shame that I found out the hard way  
And it ain't the same  
Cause you never ever got to hear me say  
That I love you, 'cause I waited too late  
It's like I would tell anybody  
Don't make the same mistake like I did  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Those three words make all the difference in the world  
You might wait and miss your chance  
So don't be scared to say what you're feeling  
You can't turn back the hands of time  
If you get the chance, do it right  
Let it out, say it now  
Say it  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
I'm ready  
Ready to shout it out, shout it out loud  
So ready  
Oh how I wish I could tell you right now  
But I waited too late  
So today I won't make the same mistake, no  
I won't do it, and if I get the chance I'll say it

Outta my head, can't concentrate  
Sometimes my love is a waste of time but  
She doesn't, she doesn't  
She don't mind  
  
She's better even than she used to be  
Loving her is no mystery  
Sometimes I'm not so sweet and kind  
She doesn't, she doesn't  
She don't mind

See, I've prayed for peace and love  
Like so many of us do  
Then I prayed to find someone like you  
Up in the morning  
Fell out of my bed  
Worn out, I couldn't sleep  
Thoughts of you filled my head  
How could it be?  
This is scaring me  
  
Seems every time I try  
To rest my heart is when  
The rush is back again  
Maybe this time I'll  
Make it work somehow  
Guess I'm gonna find out now  
  
I get a rush  
And it's love for sure  
What else can it be  
Something beckons me  
And I go back for more  
Ooo such a rush  
Can't pass love by  
What else can I do  
Something tells me to  
Give it one more try  
  
I'm not gonna die if love passes me by  
It goes and comes around, I know  
So maybe the next time I'll be one of the few  
Chosen by love to do just what I wanna do  
I will carry on wading through every day till love needs me  
Waiting for the rush to come and find me  
I still remember when love was an angel send  
It will be back again  
  
I can't remember when, I can't remember how  
It's very different now  
It's not a fantasy, it's very real to me

My suburban friends don't know my bag of blues  
I'm up in the morning on the corner so siditty

There's my fellow with the world for me to see  
It's a world full of cocktails at nine  
And dinners and wine very late shows  
And where the crowd goes  
  
I'm a girl with a world of her owna queen on her throne  
Till everything's gone and then  
I wake up to find that I'm a stranger  
In a world where I have never before  
I look for my man who held my hand

Gonna change my way of livin' talkin' bags of blues

Gonna change me some shoes baby  
  
Walkin' in a daze to my apartment where I'll grab another wink  
And doze on the sofa 'til eleven then get up and pour myself another drink

Drinkers drink about love and they cry in their beers  
Now you can think about it, drink about it  
But if you're on the brink about it  
Don't fall till you know all about love

A tycoon about love spends a fortune in vain  
Sing a dirge about it, splurge about it  
But if you're on the verge about it  
Don't fall till you know all about love  
  
You must examine your motives clearly  
Look at the facts sincerely  
Or you mess up very dearly if you don't

Over land and sea  
A little shy and sad of eye  
But very wise was he

One magic day, passed my way

Fools and kings,

Here I am trying to be proud  
Trying to fool myself with this unreal smile  
Telling everyone that I no longer cling to you  
But I know myself that can't be true  
Oh, how can I forget a love I've known for so long?  
The heart may not remember, but the mind goes on and on  
And the more I think about it the worse off I get  
Something keeps telling me  
You ain't seen nothing yet

I just don't know what I'm gonna do  
Now that you're gone, how can I go on  
The same love that made me smile  
Right now it makes me blue  
Oh, how can I get you back, I need you here so bad  
The neighbors say, since you've been away  
I seem to be so sad, you know they're right  
I can't stand to be out of your site  
You need to be here close to me to lift these lonely nights

Were on the road to romance - that's safe to say

Just then the devil, oh he emerged from the water, and he said in that dry

Tonight we'll love plenty, tomorrow maybe not any

Yes, I do, so much, so much 'til it hurts me  
He makes me cry when I wanna laugh sometimes  
His moods, they keep changing all the time

His world is not so different and you may not believe

"Chorus:  
I have been a rover, I have walked alone,  
Hiked a-hundred highways, never found a home.  
Still in all I'm happy, the reason is, you see,  
Once in a-while along the way, love's been good to me.  
There was a girl, in denver, before the Summer storm.  
Oh her eyes were tender, oh her arms were warm.  
And she could smile away thunder, kiss away the rain,  
And even though she's gone away, you won't hear me complain.  
Chorus  
There was a girl, in Portland, before the Winter chill.  
We used to go a-courting, along October hill,  
And she could laugh away the dark clouds, cry away the snow,  
It seems like only yesterday as down the road I go.

You'll hear melodies  
In the words.

That come all the way from China

He said ""All men will be sailors then  
Until the sea shall free them""

Long before the sky would open  
Forsaken, almost human  
He sank beneath your wisdom like a stone

There are children in the morning  
They are leaning out for love  
And they will lean that way forever

And i was oh so glad, and it was oh so sad  
That i realized that i despised this man i once called father.  
In his hanging on, with fingers clutching  
His body now just eighty-eight pounds  
Blinded eyes still searching  
For some distant dream that had faded away at the seams.  
Dying alone, naturally.

Just as long as i could play the piano and smile a little smile

Not ever once touching me and saying  
""daugther, i'll help you get over.""

Believes the words that the bible said ""til death do us two part"".

We all gather at the Harlem Strut  
And what we do is tut tut tut  
Ol' Hannah Brown, from way cross town  
Keeps drinking her liquor and she brings them down  
Just at the break of day  
You could hear old Hannah say  
I wanna pigfoot and a bottle of beer  
Send me daddy, 'cause I don't care  
I feel just like I wanna clown  
Give the piano player a drink  
'Cause he brought me down  
He's got rhythm when he stomps his feet  
He just send me right off to sleep  
Check all your razors and check your guns  
I'm gonna be arrested when the wagon comes

Take warning from me

One day they were marching.  
A young man came by  
With a beard on his cheek  
And a gleam in his eye.  
  
And before she had time  
To remember her brick...  
They were holding a sit-down  
On a nearby hay rig.

For meeting is pleasure  
And parting is pain.  
And if I have a great concert  
Maybe I won't have to sing those folk songs again.

I'm stiff and I'm sore

On a hard classroom floor.

She'd heard a man say,  
""Go perfectly limp,  
And be carried away.""

It was time she was kissed,  
She remembered her brief  
And did not resist.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh Mother, dear Mother,  
No need for distress,  
For the young man has left me  
His name and address.  
  
And if we win  
Tho' a baby there be,  
He won't have to march  
Like his da-da and me.

"Years, they will come and go.  
Sometimes the tears will flow.  
Some of my memories will fade,  
But I'll always remember that one September day.  
I used to reminisce  
'Cause I thought that love was bliss.  
How did they know it would go astray?  
It began, and it ended on one September day.  
We met by chance,  
As people often do,  
But it blossomed, yes, it blossomed  
Into something I never knew.  
Now... It is in the past.  
They said it would never last.  
I'll not forget the moment back,  
Nor hot May or December,  
Nor June or November,  
But one September day.

"The other woman finds time to manicure her nails  
The other woman is perfect where her rival fails  
And she's never seen with pin curls in her hair  
  
The other woman enchantes her clothes with french perfume  
The other woman keeps fresh cut flowers in each room  
There are never toys that's scattered everywhere  
  
And when her baby comes to call  
He'll find her waiting like a lonesome queen  
'Cause when she's by his side  
It's such a change from old routine  
  
But the other woman will always cry herself to sleep  
The other woman will never have his love to keep  
And as the years go by the other woman  
Will spend her life alone

Runs a flag up its masthead

By noontime the dock  
Is a-swarmin' with men  
Comin' out from the ghostly freighter  
They move in the shadows  
Where no one can see

And they're bringin' em to me  
Askin' me,

Askin' ME!  
""Kill them now, or later?""  
  
Noon by the clock  
And so still by the dock  
You can hear a foghorn miles away  
And in that quiet of death  
I'll say, ""Right now.  
Right now!""  
  
Then they'll pile up the bodies  
And I'll say,  
""That'll learn ya!""

"I was never one for singing what I really feel  
Except tonight I'm bringing everything I know that's real  
  
Stars, they come and go, they come fast or slow  
They go like the last light of the sun, all in a blaze  
And all you see is glory  
Hey but it gets lonely there when there's no one here to share  
We can shake it away, if you'll hear a story  
  
People lust for fame like athletes in a game,  
we break our collarbones and come up swinging,  
some of us are downed  
some of us are crowned, and some are lost and never found  
But most have seen it all,  
they live their lives in sad cafes and music halls  
They always come up singing  
  
Some make it when they're young,  
before the world has done its dirty job  
and later on someone will say  
""You've had your day, now you must make way""  
But they'll never know the pain of living with a name you never owned  
or the many years forgetting what you know too well  
That the ones who gave the crown have been let down  
You try to make amends without defending  
Perhaps pretending you never saw the eyes of grown men of twenty-five  
that follow as you walk and ask for autographs  
Or kiss you on the cheek and you never can believe they really loved you  
Some make it when they're old

or perhaps there's nothing there)  
  
Stars, they come and go, they come fast they come slow  
They go like the last light of the sun, all in a blaze  
And all you see is glory  
But most have seen it all,  
they live their lives in sad cafes and music halls  
They always have a story  
  
Some women have a body men will want to see  
and so they put it on display  
Some people play a fine guitar, I could listen to them play all day  
Some ladies really move across the stage and gee, they sure can dance  
I guess I could learn how, if I gave it half a chance  
  
But I always feel so funny when my body tries to soar  
And I seem to always worry about missing the next chord  
I guess there isn't anything to put up on display  
Except the tunes, and whatever else I say  
But anyway, that isn't really what I meant to say  
I meant to tell a story, I live from day to day  
  
Stars, they come and go, they're coming fast they come slow  
They go like the last light of the sun, all in a blaze  
And all you see is glory

And we always have a story

Black bodies swinging in the southern breeze,  
Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees.  
  
Pastoral scene of the gallant south,

Scent of magnolias, clean and fresh,  
Then the sudden smell of burning flesh.

For the rain to gather, for the wind to suck,  
For the sun to rot, for the leaves to drop,  
Here is a strange and bitter crop.

"A simple gospel message  
In a little church one day  
Touched the heart of one

There'd been an invitation  
Inviting all to come but kneeling  
Down to pray was only one  
For only one, He would have suffered

He'd have borne the shame

For God so loved the whole world  
He gave His only Son but I believe  
He'd have done the same  
For only one

With only one or two?

Don't be ashamed to come  
Even if you're the only one

I was climbing up a mountain  
Headed for the top  
My feet started sliding  
And I almost fell off  
I landed on a rocky ledge  
Suspended in the air  
And I cried out in despair  
I said, Is anybody out there?  
Anybody there at all?  
Then I saw Him reaching down  
And I heard Him call,  
chorus:  
Give me your hand, I'll lift you up  
Don't be afraid  
You just have to trust  
I have been there in the place you stand  
There's no need to fear  
That's why I'm here  
Give me your hand  
How can I repay you?  
You truly saved my life  
The Savior smiled  
And He said, That's alright  
Tomorrow when you're climbing  
Look around you on the way  
There are many others to be saved...  
Crying, Is anybody out there?  
Anybody there at all?  
Reach out to them, remember me, and call,

Well early Christmas morning  
While they were still asleep  
I packed a box of food and clothes  
And walked back to their street  
Imagine my surprise  
When I saw presents all around  
Blankets, toys and winter coats  
Beside them on the ground  
And the card I read from Santa said  
Inside the three of you  
The real heart of Christmas  
Is still beating strong and true  
  
Oh and Jesus loves you  
And so do I  
Think about the baby  
And the star up in the sky  
Santa Claus is comin

"The Potter's Field  
Words and music by Ray Boltz  
I fell asleep the other day  
Dreamed that I was falling  
And I woke up in a field of clay  
Voices were calling  
In the potter's field  
In the potter's field  
The broken pieces  
Lying on the ground...  
It was the strangest thing...  
Got up and began to dance around  
And I heard them sing  
chorus:  
In the potter's field  
Love is truly spoken  
Nothing is concealed  
'Cause everything is broken  
In the potter's field  
In the potter's field  
And they sang about the garden  
Where Jesus was betrayed  
And how Judas tried to take back  
All the money he'd been paid  
How the money bought the field of dirt  
The money bought the mud  
But all the broken pieces  
We have been purchased by the Blood  
In the potter's field  
Love is truly spoken  
He has come to heal  
Everything that's broken  
In the potter's field  
Love is truly spoken  
He has come to heal  
Everything that's broken  
Everything that's broken

"There Stood A Lamb  
Words and music by Ray Boltz  
He was standing in heaven  
With tears in his eyes  
Saying, tell me this isn't so  
For there was one in heaven  
And no one on earth  
Worthy to open the scroll  
Then one of the elders  
Said, John don't you cry  
It was all part of the plan  
Then in the center  
Of Gods glorious throne  
Hallelujah, there stood a lamb  
And they sang worthy  
Worthy of honor and praise  
They were casting down crowns  
And praising His name  
When he cried, who is worthy?  
I can hear Jesus saying, I am  
Oh, praise God, forever  
There stood a Lamb  
Now open your Bible  
Open your heart  
Its clear we are in last days  
And he said Ill come quickly  
So don't be surprised  
When he comes back to take us away  
And feeble excuses wont get very far  
When you find yourself  
There at His throne  
If you know Jesus  
And He is your Lord  
Hallelujah, you won't be alone  
And well sing worthy  
Worthy of honor and praise  
Well be casting down crowns  
And praising His name  
When he says, are you worthy?

"Walking on the road to Jerusalem,  
The time had come to sacrifice again,  
My two small sons,  
They walked beside me on the road,  
The reason that they came was to watch the lamb.  
  
""Daddy, daddy, What will see there,  
There's so much that we don't understand"",  
So I told them of Moses and Father Abraham,  
Then I said ""dear children watch the lamb"".  
""There will be so many in Jerusalem today,  
We must be sure the lamb doesn't run away"",  
And I told them of Moses and Father Abraham,  
Then I said ""dear children watch the lamb"".  
  
When we reached the city,  
I knew something must be wrong,  
There were no joyful worshipers,  
No joyful worship songs,  
I stood there with my children  
in the midst of angry men,  
Then I heard the crowd cry out  
""Crucify Him"".  
  
We tried to leave the city but  
we could not get away,  
Forced to play in this drama  
a part I did not wish to play,  
""Why upon this day were men condemned to die?,  
Why were we standing here, Where soon they would pass by?"".  
  
I looked and said, ""even now they come"",  
The first one cried for mercy,  
The people gave him none,  
The second one was violent,He was arrogant and loud,  
I still can hear his angry voice  
screaming at the crowd,  
Then someone said ""there's Jesus"",  
I could scarce believe my eyes,  
A man so badly beaten,  
He barely looked alive,  
Blood poured from His body,  
From the thorns upon His brow,  
Running down the cross, Falling to the ground.  
  
I watched Him as He struggled,  
I watched Him as He fell,  
The cross came down upon His back,  
The crowd began to yell,  
In that moment I felt such agony,  
In that moment I felt such loss,  
Till a Roman soldier grabbed my arm  
and screamed, ""you, carry His cross"".  
  
At first I tried to resist him,  
Then his hand reached for his sword,  
So I knelt and took the cross from the Lord,  
I placed it on my shoulder,  
And started down the street,  
The blood that he'd been shedding  
was running down my cheek.  
  
They led us to Golgotha,  
They drove nails deep in His feet and hands,  
Yet upon the cross I heard Him pray  
""Father, forgive them"".  
  
Oh, never have I seen such love in any other eyes,  
""Into thy hands I commit my spirit""  
He prayed and then He died,  
  
I stood for what seemed like years,  
I'd lost all sense of time until  
I felt two tiny hands holding tight to mine,  
My children stood there weeping,  
I heard the oldest say,  
""Father please forgive us,the lamb ran away"".  
  
""Daddy, daddy, What have we seen here?,  
There's so much that we don't understand"",  
So I took them in my arms,  
And we turned and faced the cross,  
Then I said ""dear children watch the lamb""

Like it was yesterday

Kneel in the church and pray  
That was what she had been hoping for  
Still she was so surprised  
Was that a glow upon his face?  
Or just the tears in her eyes?  
Hed always been a quiet man  
Everyone saw the change  
Reaching to take a strangers hand  
Asking to know their name  
Sunday mornings theyd be in church  
And after the pastor prayed  
Year after year with a voice so dear  
Bessie would hear him say

This is where I met Jesus  
I heard him calling my name  
I was so glad to meet Him  
He was so glad I came

"Carry On  
Words and music by Lawrence Chewning  
Carry on, carry on, carry on

Who are speaking out for Jesus  
As the winds of opposition  
Swirl around you day by day...  
Even if you're mocked and hated  
Don't you be intimidated  
There's a great reward that's waiting  
If you only carry on  
chorus:  
Carry on, carry on  
It won't be long before  
We're gathered 'round God's throne  
Carry on, carry on  
To the lonely missionary  
To the pastor growing weary  
To the parents of the wayward child  
For whom you've prayed so long...  
This is not the time to let up  
It's the time to lift your head up  
When you sow in tears  
You'll reap in joy  
Don't stop, carry on  
chorus  
And if you're facing great temptation  
And you need some consolation  
'Cause the devil's doing all he can  
Just to make you trip and fall...  
Well, the devil will accuse you  
He'll even try to bruise you  
But resist him, and he'll flee from you  
Get up, and carry on

"Does The Light Still Shine?  
Words by Ray Boltz, Music by Steve Millikan and Ray Boltz  
He used to run the mission  
This old friend of mine  
And it stood down on the corner  
Underneath a neon sign  
Had a cross that lit up heaven  
And the message ""Jesus Saves""  
And each week at the old folks' home  
His question was the same  
Chorus:  
Does the light still shine?  
Does the light still shine?  
Is it bright enough  
For the lost to find?  
Does the light still shine?  
Now how was I to tell him  
They tore the old sign down,  
Explain about electric codes,  
And zoning in the town  
I knew that it would break his heart,  
I didn't want to lie  
So I just held his hand and smiled  
When he asked me the last time,  
Chorus  
In a quiet ceremony  
I began to understand  
After all the testimonies  
For this ordinary man  
He took them in, he gave them food  
He taught them of God's grace  
And as they spoke  
I saw a light  
Shining on each face  
And you may not believe it  
But I tell you that's it true  
The light kept growing brighter  
Until it filled the room  
I heard a voice say,  
This, my friend, is what  
I was speaking of...  
When you touch someone in Jesus' name  
There shines the light of love  
Oh the light still shines  
Oh the light still shines  
Yes it's bright enough  
For the lost to find  
Oh the light still shines

I gave my heart to Jesus  
When I was just a child

It's been quite a while

I bowed my head and prayed  
That's the best decision

Every Sunday morning  
In a church outside of town  
Family, friends, and neighbors  
All would gather round  
When you neared the corner  
You could hear the church bell ring  
And when you reached the front door  
You could hear the people sing

He is great and greatly to be praised  
In a world that's changing  
He remains the same  
He is faithful  
He still saves  
Give your heart to Jesus  
And He'll wash your sins away  
I went home last summer  
And I tried to find my past  
But all I found were withered boards  
And panes of broken glass  
I thought about that chapel  
As I neared the edge of town  
I couldn't help but wonder  
If it was still around  
And do they sing  
Chorus  
I turned the corner  
And I looked on down the road  
Deep inside I thought it would be gone  
But there were people everywhere

Was still going strong

And He said before he returns  
We'd see lots of things  
Keep your eyes on the heavens  
And don't you be surprised  
When a trumpet sounds  
And we leave the ground  
And meet Him in the skies

"Jesus Real Loud  
Words and music by Ray Boltz  
The doors opened up  
And I got on the elevator  
I saw the other people  
Who were standing around  
Everyone was silent  
No one made a sound  
And I thought,  
What if I said Jesus real loud?  
Hey!  
Chorus:  
What if I said Jesus real loud?  
What if I just lifted up my voice  
And did it now?  
Would you think I was a prophet?  
Would you still want me around?  
What if I said Jesus real loud?  
What if I said Jesus real loud?  
What if I just lifted up my voice  
Above the crowd?  
Would you think I was a prophet?  
Would you think I was a clown?  
What if I said Jesus real loud?  
The doors opened up  
And I went in the dentist's office  
They handed me a magazine  
They told me to sit down  
Everyone was waiting  
No one made a sound  
And I thought,  
What if I said Jesus real loud?  
Hey!  
Chorus  
It's ok sometimes to whisper  
But hey, listen to me mister  
The way we act can anybody tell?  
Lift your voice a little higher  
Smell the smoke and feel the fire  
Ain't it time somebody  
Started to yell?  
Chorus  
What if I said Jesus real loud?

"Loving Each Other  
Words and music by Ray Boltz  
Your eyes are brown  
My eyes are blue  
But that doesn't mean  
That I can't love you  
You've found a place here in my heart  
So take my hand and we can start...  
CHORUS:  
Loving each other, loving the Lord  
Serving together in one accord  
There's no young or old here  
There's no rich or poor  
Loving each other, loving the Lord  
Your eyes are brown  
My eyes are blue  
He gave His life for me and for you  
We all have a place here in His heart  
So give me your hand and we will start...

Of eyes and of skin  
They were all created to glorify Him

"My Father's Song  
Words and music by Ray Boltz  
When I was just a little child  
We'd climb in this old family car  
And daddy would start to sing  
Before we rode very far  
I really don't remember  
If his songs were quite on key  
But that didn't matter to me  
It was my Father's song  
CHORUS:  
And he sings a song of love  
And a song of caring  
You sing it with your heart  
You sing it with your life  
And it's a song of giving  
Much more than you're asked  
And knowing that  
What you've done for Christ  
Is all that's going to last  
As I grew up I heard that song  
Time and time again  
A gentle word or a tender touch  
And that song would begin  
I can hear it in his laughter  
And it moves me more and more  
I can see it in his eyes  
When he talks about the Lord  
It's my Father's song  
And if I were the greatest musician  
Who ever walked upon a stage  
If I could sing any song I liked  
Any instrument I could play  
I wouldn't need a piano  
I wouldn't need a violin  
I'd choose a heart filled with his love  
And then I'd begin  
To sing my Father's song  
His song

"Never Lost  
Words and music by Ray Boltz  
They saw the clouds on the horizon  
Nobody seemed to be concerned  
Jesus said they must cross the water  
Now He was sleeping in the stern  
Quick as the flash of summer lightning  
Caught on a sea of crashing waves  
Waking Him up and crying, Save us!  
They didn't need to be afraid  
CHORUS:  
Never lost  
He knows where you're going  
Never lost  
Even though the wind is blowing  
And there may be some stormy seas  
He says you must cross  
But with Jesus at your side  
You're never lost  
We used to rise and face the morning  
Like it was just another day  
But now we know that without warning  
How quickly everything can change  
It's like we're standing in a doorway  
And what lies beyond we cannot see  
As we step into the next moment  
Or into eternity  
CHORUS  
Mountains crumble  
And crash into the sea  
Kings and kingdoms do the same  
But if we place our trust  
In what we cannot see  
Our faith in Jesus will remain

"Not Long Ago

Not long ago you were happy  
There was a light in your eyes  
Not long ago how you loved Him so  
Remember when you  
Gave Him your life?  
Can you tell me what happened?  
Did your heart slowly grow cold?  
Did you give in to temptation  
And now you feel so alone?  
Chorus:  
When not long ago  
Seems so far away  
The journey begins  
The moment you pray  
Like a prodigal son  
It's time to come home  
To the One that you loved  
Not long ago  
Not long ago God gave us  
The gift of His own precious Son  
Not long ago, how He suffered so  
For all of the wrongs we have done  
If He suffered to save us  
If He would pay such a cost  
He'll put His arms around you  
And give you back what you've lost

"One Drop Of Blood  
Words by Ray Boltz, Music by Ray Boltz and Steve Millikan  
Standing in the courtroom  
When I heard, how do you plead?  
The accuser of the brethren  
Was staring at me  
He said, we got your number  
There is no escape  
For here are your transgressions,  
Your failures and mistakes  
He pointed to the corner  
Where the scales of justice stood  
I saw so many failures there  
There was nothing good  
And in that very moment  
When it seemed all hope was lost  
I said, I plead the blood of Jesus  
And his death upon the cross  
Chorus:  
One drop of blood  
Fell to the scales  
It covered my transgressions  
And all the times I failed  
The enemy was mighty  
He came in like a flood  
He was defeated by one drop of blood  
I stood and watched in silence  
As others were brought in  
I saw them start to tremble  
When they turned and faced their sin  
They offered no excuses  
They offered no alibis  
The truth was overwhelming  
And it would not be denied  
Their righteousness like filthy rags  
And nothing they could say  
They bowed their heads in silence  
As they were led away  
But for the true believers  
Each time it was the same  
His glory shown around them  
As they called upon his name  
One drop of blood  
Fell to the scales  
It covered their transgressions  
And all the times they failed  
The enemy was mighty  
He came in like a flood  
He was defeated by one drop of blood  
No greater sacrifice has any other made  
Oh yes he paid the price  
With every drop he gave

Below or above  
We have the power to love

And out in the street  
A multitude gathered around

Was filling the earth

Laughter was filling the air  
Filled with His glorious

He is the high priest  
Who offered Himself for our sins

Where they laid Him  
And there only silence was found  
But on the third day  
The stone rolled away  
And the whole world  
Woke up to the sound

"The Gospel Of Grace  
Words by Ray Boltz, Music by Greg Gilpin and Ray Boltz  
They say in the harbor of heaven  
Is a ship called the Gospel of Grace  
A glorious ship, that once made a trip  
Through the oceans of time and space  
She followed a star to a stable  
She carried the Child of the King  
And when she set sail  
So goes the tale  
All of the angels would sing  
Chorus:  
The Gospel of Grace is sailing  
What a glorious sight to behold  
Her heavenly banners are waving  
Her sails are covered with gold  
They say when a man looks upon her  
The glory will shine on his face  
For therell never be  
A ship on the sea  
Like the glorious Gospel of Grace  
She sailed to the land of the lonely  
To the meek and the lowly she came  
And each one she passed  
From the first to the last  
Would never again be the same  
The voice of the Father had spoken  
A heavenly sign had come down  
And everyone knew  
His promise was true  
The heavens were filled with the sound  
Chorus  
Then one day she sank to the bottom  
At a place called old rugged cross  
But the Child of the King,  
Now her captain  
Came sailing her back to the top  
And then as they sailed  
Off toward heaven  
He called out, Get ready my friends  
I must go away, but therell come a day  
I promise youll see Me again  
And the Gospel of Grace will be sailing  
What a glorious sight well behold  
Her heavenly banners a waving  
Shes coming to carry us home  
For now we see through a glass darkly  
But then we will see face to face  
And as we climb aboard  
Well give thanks to the Lord  
For His glorious Gospel of Grace  
And as we climb aboard  
Well give thanks to the Lord

"I was in the crowd  
The day that Jesus died  
And as He hung upon the cross  
His mother cried  
I saw the crown of thorns He wore  
The stripes upon His back  
The water and the blood ran out  
And then the sky turned black  
My mind was filled with anger  
My heart was filled with shame  
This man brought only healing  
Who could bring Him pain  
Why does it seem the strong  
Always victimize the weak?  
And suddenly I found myself  
Standing to my feet  
And I cried, ""Who nailed Him there?  
This Child of peace and mercy  
Who nailed Him there?  
Come and face me like a man  
Who nailed Him there?""  
And the crowd began to mock me  
I cried, ""Oh my God, I do not understand""  
Then I turned and saw the hammer

An ordinary man  
I love my wife and children

How could I have killed Him?  
It must be someone else

I just can't blame myself

When we get there

"The Last To Be Chosen

Today in the school yard  
They were choosing up sides

With tears in his eyes  
He'd been there before  
And everyone knew  
He'd be alone  
When the choosing was through

The Father looked down  
And He saw what happened  
There on the ground  
And angels rejoiced  
When He said to His son,  
Watch what I do with this one

The last to be chosen  
Are the first He will call  
And what He does through them  
Will amaze one and all  
It won't be the hero  
That carries the ball  
The last to be chosen  
Are the first He will call  
Now don't be discouraged  
And don't be afraid  
God is not worried  
With the choice that He made  
Others may laugh or doubt at the start  
But He sees what's there in your heart

The last to be chosen

When my age had doubled  
I met a man and his name was Trouble

A family is fine  
And theres a time you need them  
But sure enough there will come  
A time to leave em

"A woman came to Simon's house,  
She knew the Lord was there,  
For when she walked into the room  
She was greeted by a stare,  
She surely must have shocked a few  
Of the people gathered there,  
As with tear-filled eyes  
And trembling hands  
She took down her long dark hair,  
And from an alabaster vessel  
Precious ointment filled her hair,  
As she wept she kissed his feet  
And began anointing them.  
Chorus  
With her hands, she was touching him,  
The alpha the omega,  
The beginning and the end,  
And with her hands  
She was holding on to His,  
The source of life  
Was right there in her hands.  
Now Simon said within his heart,  
Lord if you only knew the kind of woman  
That's touching you,  
But Jesus knew about her past,  
He knew about the sin,  
Yet He saw in her a repentant heart  
That had come to worship Him.

Now tell me why do we gather  
Together in His name,  
Are we like the ones who merely watched,  
Tell me is that why we came,  
Are we like this sister,  
Do we truly enter in,  
In spirit and in truth,  
Have you come to worship Him.  
With your hands, are you touching him,  
And with your heart are you loving Him,

Are you holding on to His,

Just passing through  
Strangers in a strange land

Are on the pavement

In a foreign land

Truly, I really really really really really truly truly wanna figure out  
What my doodlin's all about.

Had me arrested,  
Took me to Bellevue,  
Where I was tested.  
  
Had me a doctor  
Probin' my noodle,  
'Fore he was half-done,  
Taught him to doodle,  
Showed him hidden thoughts that linger  
Find an outlet through your finger,

Doctor was real nice,  
Told me to be cool,  
Looked at the waiter,  
Called him the real fool,  
  
Looked at my baby  
Told me he dug her,  
Got me to doodlin',

Quite to his surprise he found her,

"Hide nor hair  
Oh, I was lying in the bed with fever

My baby walked in my bedroom  
And I could hardly open my eyes

Just across the track  
She started packing some clothes in a hurry

Well I waited for her twenty four hours  
And I was just about to starve to death  
It didn't look like she was coming back  
So I had to look out for myself  
Well I called the police department  
To find out what they knew  
They said, no by heck but we will get her yet  
Because they were looking for her too.  
But I ain't seen hide nor hair my baby since that day

Well I don't know what happened across the track  
But I know my baby didn't make it back  
I ain't seen hide nor hair my baby since that day.  
Well I called my Dr. Foster  
And when the girl answered the phone  
I got a funny feeling  
The way she said Dr. Foster had gone  
She said he left with a lady patient  
About twenty four hours ago  
I added two and two and here's what I got

How did you get away, baby

They put a gun in my hand and said ""shoot until he's dead.""  
But it's hard to kill when 'please, I'm your friend' echoes through your head  
Brought up in church taught no man should take another's life  
But then put in the jungle where life has no price, no

They laugh and say quit braggin' 'bout the war you should have never been in

Like the galaxies in time  
If it's pleasing  
Then why can't it be never leaving  
Like the day that never fails  
Like on seashores there are shells  
Like the time that always tells  
It holds the key to every heart  
Throughout the universe  
It fills you up without a bite  
And quenches every thirst  
So  
If it's special  
Then with it why aren't we as careful  
As making sure we dress in style  
Posing pictures with a smile  
Keeping danger from a child  
It holds the key to every heart  
Throughout the universe  
It fills you up without a bite  
And quenches every thirst  
So  
If it's magic  
Why can't we make it everlasting  
Like the lifetime of the sun  
It will leave no heart undone  
For there's enough for everyone

"My love is gone with yesterday, my love is gone  
With yesterday  
  
We had a love for all seasons  
At least that's how it used to be  
There was no time, space, or reason  
More special to us than we  
  
My love continued to flourish  
As a flower blooms in spring  
Then you tried to play love for silly  
But the loser is the fool who doesn't play  
Love by the rules  
  
If she breaks your heart  
I will send a robin to sing happy tunes for you  
Cause I may not be around to do the things  
I used to do  
And if you awake to find you're lost  
I will send a glad star to lead you on your way  
Cause the love I felt inside  
Has gone away with yesterday  
  
My love is gone with yesterday, my love is gone  
With yesterday  
  
There was a time when forever  
Was common-place for me and you  
Laughing, loving, sharing, caring  
Seemed to be made just for us two  
But I kept on building the dream world  
That I thought was you and I  
Sorry, I'm sadly mistaken  
Cause our castle in the sky  
Has turned into a mere goodbye  
  
Well if she breaks your heart  
I will send a robin to sing happy tunes for you  
Cause I may not be around to do the things  
I used to do  
And if you awake to find you're lost  
I will send a glad star to lead you on your way  
Cause the love I felt inside  
Has gone away with yesterday  
Has gone away with yesterday  
  
My love is gone away with yesterday, my love is gone  
With yesterday  
My love is gone away with yesterday, my love is gone

You can't wave a sign that spells ""evil"" and feel really proud  
You can't sing a song with no melody

You can't be confused and still say you understand  
You can't be a friend but not through thin and thick  
You can't be a click but in danger split  
You can't evenly share and then grab the biggest hand  
You can't say you do but then show you don't  
You can't say you will and make sure you won't  
You can't want for change and not do what you need to do  
  
You can't give up all and then take back all you give  
You can't live to die but you can die to live

Being every night and day all alone  
Going through ages and ages, places and spaces  
With never finding that someone to call your own

Hidden for good in a stolen lost and found  
But just when fate was calling quits  
Love appeared in the midst of despair, came and turned your life around

New like a nightingale that's just learned to sing  
I'm new, new like the very start of dawn  
Like a child that's first born with your love, I'm new  
  
You're standing amongst a crowd of six billion people  
Crying out for help, but no one understands  
'Cause much to your dismay, you've been taken far away  
To a land where joy is pain and sorrow's a happy man  
  
Where an aching heart's the sign of the mighty  
And a love-filled heart looks down upon with fault and shame  
But at the very instant all was through, lady lucks appears, says ""love can
do""  
And changed you like a Christian who's been born again  
  
I'm new, new like the fresh morning dew  
New like a work of art that's finally through  
I'm new, new like a first flight of a dove  
So safe and secure with your love, I'm new

Coupled by your embrace

As if we can't believe it's so

Has got us longing for much more  
We lie there impatient  
Anxiously waiting foe the sun to go in  
And the clouds to burst again, to give us

The kind of rain that writes they're  
So in love on our skin  
Raindrops, that we hope won't stop  
Cooling the red hot love that we are making

"Some people ask me why always on the bright side  
When there's so much going on down the other side  
It's like I live in a bubble with no trouble  
And problems don't exist  
I chuckle and tell them that ain't the case at all  
It goes way back to the time when I was very small  
Not in mind but size and age my papa use to say  
You can always look at the negative  
But you should always live in the positive  
So I try everyday to live that way  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Some people live in what was and what they could have been  
As opposed to living in a what is and how much they can  
And be the first to complain about nothing in life going their way  
The attitude is ""that I can't do nothing 'bout""  
And very happy with just breathing in and out  
The ones that when you say ""lets go make a difference""  
They'll say ""naw that's OK""  
So I don't waste time on the trip side  
'Cause I do know the real on the flipside  
And I'm crystal clear everyday that's why I say, yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
When I see the morning  
And the sun is smiling down upon me  
I joy in the blessing  
That still the ground is not above me  
And for the people  
That I can truly say do love me, I feel  
Positivity, 'cause that's what life's meant to be  
Positivity, 'cause this day did not have to be  
Some ask me why I'm such an optimist  
When it's more fashionable be a pessimist  
From what's in seventy-five percent of what we read, hear and view  
Well I use to have a friend named Minnie Riperton  
Who use to always say when she was living  
""Like fine wine I like seeing the glass of life as half full than half empty""  
I'm saying sometimes life can't be rough  
But never to the point of me saying I've had enough  
Long as my heart beats I ain't giving up  
That's why I say everyday  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
When people ask me as an African American  
What do I see for tomorrow in the human plan?  
Is it possible for all the people of the world to co-exist?  
I say unity is only as big as our vision  
And if its narrow, try to expand beyond the horizon  
But true leaders must guide us through the ills of society  
That stands in our way  
So if the road is to harmony, be with the call  
But if its about discord, don't take the ride at all  
'Cause the world vision I see is the one-we for everybody  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
When I see the morning  
And the sun is smiling down upon me  
Just joy in the blessing  
That still the ground is not above me  
And for the people  
That you can truly say do love you, do feel

"Feelin' young and full of fun  
Hangin' out with my crew

Hair braided down to her knees

Gave it all right down to the bone

On a summer night  
  
Far from meek, and feelin' chic  
Refusing to concede defeat  
There I was same crew, same time  
Same club we kicked it at the previous week  
  
I asked her how could she have the nerve  
To treat me with such disgrace  
She blinked her eyes, smiled, apologized  
Threw her drink right in my face

I took no time, drove to her house  
Got deep into a passion high  
I heard a knock, the turn of a key

Like when snow's above your knees  
Cold chill  
Like sitting at the north pole  
A cold chill  
Wearing not one stitch of clothes  
Cold chill  
Like a winter Chicago night  
A cold chill  
Twenty ice cubes down your back for spite  
Cold chill  
Stranded in sub-zero degrees  
A cold chill  
Laid out on the arctic sea  
Cold chill  
When your fingers get frost bite  
A cold chill  
Buried beneath ten feet of ice  
Cold chill  
Baby, that ain't so nice  
A cold chill

You see, I was born and raised in the slums of the city,  
It was a one room shack that slept ten other children besides me.

It was hard times,  
Needed something to ease my troubled mind.

Folks down there tell me,  
They say, ""give yourself a chance son, don't let life pass you by"".  
But the world of reality is a rat race where only the strongest survive,  
It's a dog eat dog world, and that ain't no lie.

Other fellas never, never ring her phone  
She let's them know just where they stand  
She tells them all that I'm her man  
And when we're out on a date  
All the fellas wait till I walk away  
They try to beat my time  
She tells them in a nice way she's mine, all mine

"Life lands a freshing blow.  
And once again our heart is broken.  
And as history repeats itself.  
These few words are sadly spoken.  
  
I've passed this way before.  
I've felt this pain before.  
A hurt that took so long to end.  
Has found my poor heart again.  
  
As I watch love walking away.  
It brings back old memories.  
But a familiar pain still feels the same.  
Once again, heartache has found me.  
  
A dark cloud covered my heart.  
Oh, when she told me goodbye.  
Now there's nothing left but emptiness.  
And the tears that filled my crying eyes.

No matter how strong a man is.  
Without a love he walks in the dark, baby.  
If love deserts him it would surely hurt him.  
'Cause his weakness is his heart.  
  
A lonely journey now stands before me.  
The endless pain has started.  
But this time I know the way.  
Walking alone and broken hearted.  
  
Because I've passed this way before.

If you met me one time, just half the way  
I could meet you where you are  
Just meet me where I am

Deeper than deep

"A one in a million chance  
You know the moment that you crossed over the line  
A casual glance  
No one has to read between the lines  
In the south of France it was spring time  
Special feelings come alive  
There's romance in the air, so they say  
Love could be a small cafe away  
  
Love is a piece of cake  
And making love is all there is to eat  
It's a heart out of a lamb  
When you start to feel forever in a kiss  
But you must remember there's no point of refuge  
You only have a part in a lover's play  
And you could be the one left in the dark  
If someone takes a shortcut to your heart  
  
All too soon you're touching for the last time  
No one has to tell you how it is  
It's just a memory two people share  
File it under foreign affair

"I tied my bandana, took my pack from the floor  
You were still sleeping,as i stood at the door  
Once more i was heading to,God only knows where  
That's when it hit me,i was already there  
I could ramble,a thousand miles or more  
Never find the light I've seen in your eyes before  
  
You gave me the freedom to go on my own way  
But you gave me much more,you gave me the freedom to stay  
Why keep on running,just to wish on a star  
Searching for Heaven,when i know where you are  
Life is just empty,when you're walking alone  
So wherever we're going girl,Lord it's good to be at home

My heart, suspended in time

Remember, remember, so happy

Goldeneye, I found his weakness  
Goldeneye, he'll do what I please  
Goldeneye, no time for sweetness  
But a bitter kiss will bring him to his knees  
  
You'll never know how I watched you from the shadows as a child  
You'll never know how it feels to be the one who's left behind  
You'll never know the days and the nights, the tears, the tears I've cried  
But now my time has come and time, time is not on your side  
  
See him move through smoke and mirrors  
Feel his presence in the crowd  
Other girls they gather around him  
If I had him I wouldn't let him out  
  
Goldeneye, not lace or leather  
Golden chain take him to the spot  
Goldeneye, I'll show him forever  
It will take forever to see what I've got  
  
You'll never know how I watched you from the shadows as a child  
You'll never know how it feels to get so close and be denied  
It's a gold and honey trap I've got for you tonight  
Revenge is a kiss this time I won't miss  
Now I've got you in my sight

We always do it nice and rough

"I know I vowed to never do this again but

Though that I knew you'll never know  
  
Yea yea  
Listen babe  
  
Let me start by saying that  
The way I feel for you is never once changed  
And the games that we played, mistakes I made  
Leave me sorrier than you'll ever know  
  
We got in problem babe I cant lie  
Cause lately I realize that I  
Never knew that we was on the same (playing field)  
Knew that there was wrong but we (let it be)  
And I know you never knew when you say I do  
That you would have to face all the (pain you feel)  
  
And its killin' me girl  
That you have to live with this  
Live with the lies I tell  
Live with the pain you feel  
Knowing the man you love is fooling around  
  
Oh baby said its killin' me girl  
Said I just don't understand  
Why you wanna be with this kind of man oh ho  
Why would you love a fool with all the things I do  
I know its hard for you  
Hard for you to live with him  
  
Trail memories from moments  
Treat love to be lonely  
Guess that's just the man in me  
Blaming onto liberty  
When the nights off feel like the right time  
And its spotlight feel like the white light  
But its really just my fears  
And still don't dry your tears,  
When I say she ain't true when I really love you more  
When you say if its true  
What you do it for and I  
I really don't know there's no excuse  
I break your heart make you cry  
I just wanna say goodbye  
  
Its killin' me girl that you have to live with these

I know its hard for you  
Hard for you to live with him  
  
What a feel I don't even gotta right it  
Its like poisons in my body  
And there's no way to deny  
That my heart is a time bomb  
With seconds left to explode  
But I gotta let you know before it blows  
  
That it ain't on you  
Its my fault  
All the gossip n' talkin'  
Behind your back when you walkin'  
By the time you will know  
Before long you'll see, that you deserve more  
You deserve more  
You deserve so much more  
Than what I'll ever be

So grab some folks and won't you slide right through  
He brought this shorty that I used to know  
It brought me back to when I was in school  
  
She said usher where have you been?  
We used to kick it every now and then  
Remember when I used to call your phone  
Tell you come on cause my mother's gone  
  
How about them times I had to throw  
A rock at your window  
To let you know to come downstairs  
And open the door  
  
And after that baby it was on for sure  
  
Honey got my head spinnin' around for real  
'Cause I'm thinking 'bout how good you used to feel  
And I got a girl now and I don't get down like this, huh  
But I must admit I'm tempted and startin' to reminisce, cause

On a tour of my house so we can catch up  
For all the time lost since I blew up  
And became the man that drops his pants  
And every girl around the world is dying to love  
  
Break the beat down  
Let me tell you what I'm talking about  
If you're not careful it'll turn you out  
It's that way she used to go  
  
When you want it nice and slow  
Even though you can't  
The memory will make you want some mo'  
She used to understand me  
  
Touch me, hold me, taught me how to be a man  
She used to kiss me all them things she used to show me  
Damn I wish that I could do it again  
  
Honey got my head spinnin' around for real  
Cause I'm thinking 'bout how good you used to feel  
But I got a girl now and yo she's right upstairs  
But I must admit I'm tempted and startin' to not care, cause...

Never had somebody that's as bad  
Somebody with a whole lot of body  
That'll choose, make you want to leave the one you with  
'Cause you know how good it is  
  
Not a prissy, lil' missy baby, talk that slang  
I used to love how she kissed me when she popped that thang  
She was a friend of the fam  
Hot without the glam, not  
  
When I be trippin'  
She didn't really give a damn, stop

[Interlude]  
That night I said I was recording late  
I wasn't recording late  
I was just smokin' chillin' had a couple dranks  
Not much of anything  
That time I flew down to MIA  
Damn I went MIA  
I hit up KOD with a few bands to play  
And that ain't everything  
All I think about is bitches  
And everywhere I go they comin'  
Double standards that everybody talkin' bout  
The tables turned around I be throwin' up  
So I ain't tryna' justify

"[Intro]  
I, mean, everybody want somebody that's got confidence  
You know it's in her attitude  
The way she walks, nice legs  
She's gotta be beautiful, nice thin waist  
Fat ass, ooh  
And them soft little lips  
Little lips, little lips, little lips  
  
[Breakdown]  
Little lips, little lips, little lips, little lips  
Little lips, little lips, little lips, little lips  
I wonder if your lips are as soft as I imagine them to be  
Little lips, little lips, little lips, little lips  
Little lips, little lips, little lips, little lips  
Little lips, little lips, little lips, little lips  
Little lips, little lips, little lips, little lips  
Little lips, little lips, little lips, little lips  
The crazy shit is you're the only girl I love  
Little lips, little lips, little lips  
[Verse 1]  
I reminisce of all of the things that don't exist yet  
Like the breakfast on Sunday mornings after drunk sex  
Or when you're out with your girls and you send me a drunk text  
Saying ""Baby are you far, want you to come closer to my heart""  
I miss you girl, whoever you are  
  
[Hook]  
Oh, I miss you, already  
And I just wanna kiss you, already  
So come on, come on, come on  
If you are ready, hurry up to the home  
You don't know I miss you, already  
Girl I miss you, yeah

Little lips, little lips, little lips, little lips  
  
[Verse 2]  
Pillow cases covered in traces of your makeup  
And, if I ever cheat, all I'm gonna taste is your flavor, real shit  
I dreamt about you last night, I ain't wanna wake up  
Even though I can't see you so far  
Lookin' just like the the tint of my car  
I miss you girl, whoever you are  
  
[Hook]  
Oh, I miss you, already  
And I just wanna kiss you, already  
So come on, come on, come on  
If you are ready, hurry up to the home  
You don't know I miss you already  
  
[Post-Hook]  
I like the way your frame is  
I wonder if your sex is as good as I assume it's gonna be  
The crazy shit is you already knew what it was  
  
[Outro]  
Take this, take that girl, but don't take time  
To take my heart, baby come claim mine  
Won't wait forever but I wait for you  
Don't take too long girl cause I'm missin' you  
  
[Hook]  
Oh, I miss you, already  
And I wanna kiss you, already  
So come on, come on, come on  
If you are ready, hurry up to the phone  
You don't know I miss you, already

Used to jump up in the Maybach and roll out  
Used to care, she used to share  
The love that she used to give me can't be found  
I lost my way, she said she'd stay  
And lately I've been sleeping with a ghost  
My stock is down and out, I used to be worth my weight in gold  
That was before a great depression kicked in and rocked us  
And that was before the hurricane came, came in and stopped us  
I told you to leave, but you lied to me  
When you said that, ""baby no worries I promise to get us back"".

I really want to give her everything she deserves  
But the bad took away the good  
She thinks that I'm full of it, arguments, always pissed, man I'm tired  
Every kiss that I miss, girl you know I'm trying  
You never believe when I say, and I never believe it when you say  
I love you, and I shouldn't complain about it  
I should take it like a man and walk up out it  
Cause we will never be the same, oh  
I've been standing in gas, and you have been the flame

How could the love of my life, and my potential wife be the

Thought she someone that I can trust  
But she's been doubling up with us  
You can't, man we've been messing with the same girl  
  
See I met her at this party in Atlanta  
Well I met her at this party in Chicago  
She came right up to me given me conversation  
I said do you got a man she said no, with no hesitation  
Well it must be a music thing cause she said the same to me  
At a party all in my face, when I'm laughin' and buyin' her drinks  
  
She whispered in my ear and said can you take me home  
Me too  
Man she was in the chi singin' that same song  
Is that true  
And I thought it was true confession when she said  
I love you  
Man I thought her body was calling when she said  
I want you  
Look I even got some pictures on my phone  
Look at there, there she is with some boy shorts on  
  
[Chorus]  
  
She said she got me on her ring tone  
Are you talking about the pink phone  
Mm the blue one  
Man she told me that was turned off  
Its obvious that shes been playing us playing us  
Or constantly she's been lyin' to us lyin' to us  
Don't like the way that she's been goin' 'bout it goin' 'bout it  
Kellz what do you think we should do about it do about it  
Call her up at her home, she won?t know that I'm on the phone  
Yeah man that's a way  
Homie we about to bust this trick  
Man just ask her to meet up with you and I'm gonna show up too  
And then she won't know what to do  
We'll be standing there singing

I would pick her up at the Airport

"Hey, I feel like I could just blow on up  
Anytime I could just lose control  
Caught up in your lovin' every time I feel your touch

You're everything I wanted before I knew just what I wanted  
And hey, hey, you're killing me on the inside  
You're the only one I want I can't deny

Don't know what to do, what to say  
I'm not sure what to tell you confused  
Which way, do I take your hand or let go  
Do I take your hand or let it go

Hey, I feel I could blow on up  
Every time I feel your love I get so caught up  
It's your kiss it's your touch it's just everything  
But I'm feeling like I want to just run away  
Can't tell you what I want, but your'e everything I want  
And hey, hey it's killing me on the inside  
Cause you're all I ever wanted so I can't deny

Somebody tell me  
Oh, is it that I'm so wrong, I can't say  
Or is it my life, so young, careless ways

But the more I hold you in my arms the pressure starts to build  
Build, build, build, build

2000 it's us  
Yo, it's time to u-turn  
Ya heard me?  
You're either with us, or against us, yo  
  
It's been some years now  
Since we hit the floor to get down  
We always had a step to go with the sound  
Now everybody want to sit around, drink and ball  
Remember, the snake  
And how the floor used to clear  
And everybody would break  
What's crunk now used to be called getting to it  
We're bringing it all back  
This is how we do it, just  
  
[Chorus: x 2]  
Put your hands up, bend your knees  
Bounce around in a circle, get down with me  
Oh come on, come on  
It's not hard to learn  
Come on, come on  
It's called the u-turn  
  
In the 80s, fresh was the talk  
MJ had everybody doing the moonwalk  
In the 90s, I had a high flat top  
Doing the wop, Pee Wee to the Reebok  
I can't forget about my high school days  
The sound was Bobby Brown  
The dance was the running man  
Now everybody want to push Bentley's  
The year is two, everybody do the u-turn  
  
[Chorus: x 2]  
  
All you need to do is let go  
Let the tempo take over you  
I came to have a good time  
Let the rhythm deep inside your soul  
Let it lead you to the floor, whoa

I lay back in my seat and think of some pimp shit to say  
It's been a while since one look, made me feel this way  
And I don't intend to let you go, no  
  
And baby I can't wait  
To show you all around the world

Just trust your man and let me, do me, baby  
I wanna take you places you only see on TV  
Oh girl, I got just what you need  
  
I gotta make a move before the light tries to change  
Let down my window and tell you to just follow me

Wifey home, wedding band I'm a lucky man,  
You'd think I'd be satisfied and truthfully yes I am,  
But lately, only late at night I find it hard to sleep,  
Stay struggling with the part of me that wants to run the streets,  
My Mac is in my backpack, I'm surfing on the sites,  
I'm chatting, this ain't cheating, just telling myself a lie,  
And it's almost like I'm caught up and living another life,  
Man I'm hungry for something, I need to feed this appetite

Tempted I must confess, but I better not make a mess,  
Better give my girl my best put my b.s. under arrest,  
Cause I love my lady,  
Fellas if ya love your girl fight that appetite for the ladies, appetite for
the ladies,  
Could'a picked up the phone, could of ended up doing wrong,  
Man I miss home, but I ate my dinner at home, cause I love my lady,

I'm not trying to be late, rush through security gates,  
With weather in Atlanta, all out going flights delayed,  
No rooms left in the Mandarin, I gotta figure out a play,  
Sparked up some conversation, she was going the same way,  
We started talking business, she handed me a card,  
We exchanged information, I rented me a car,  
While I'm driving she calling, I'm thinking this is how it starts,  
Fine as hell but I don't wanna break my baby?s heart, no no no.

They call me U.S.H.E.R R.A.Y.M.O.N.D,

But lately I been slippin' up, fantasies bout dimes on the side,  
Dark tint on my ride, I gotta 10 in ride, I can hide,  
I can't lie lie, but ever since I put that band on my hand,  
More and more chicks trying to get at me,  
Then I don't know what to do,  
Just trying to handle my grown man B.I,  
Got a girl I don't want to lose, I don't want to lose,  
Break her heart, I do want to do, I don't want to be that fool,  
Make that move,  
Bend them a bit, but never break the rules, bend a bit but never break the
rules

She got the door locked, and the lock don't fit, your key,  
Yeah you punching up her numbers in the ADT,  
You'll be wondering how the hell I let this happen to me,  
Better not feed feed feed that appetite,  
Now your baby's gone, you putting out an APB

At all  
At all

Been through hell, now I'm hell proof  
Pouring cups of whiskey to get through it  
Oh sweet child of mine, gone way too soon  
Lost myself and lost my faith too

I've had my share of ups and downs  
I've had my share of down and outs  
Baptized in a river and almost drowned  
Thats when I figured out  
I'm stronger than ever now, stronger than ever now  
I'm stronger than ever now, stronger than ever now  
Stronger than ever now  
Ohh

Walk through fire now I'm fireproof  
Forever wear these scars like tattoos  
Finally found paradise right in my view  
And its killing me that I can't share it with you

Though you're gone you still live in my mind  
The only thing we ran out of is time  
Since you left I ain't been quite the same  
I wonder if you miss me, do I make you proud  
Know you're watching me, I feel your spirit  
I keep you right by my side  
I'm stronger than ever now, far from perfect  
Life will knock you down, get back up  
Fight for whats worth it  
Be strong enough, I know its easier said than done  
  
[Bridge]  
Stronger than ever now  
I been through it, now stronger  
Stronger now, hey stronger now  
All that I been through some how I found my way out

We're here alone while the thunder is roaring  
And the windows are blowing  
'Cause it's storming and pouring tonight  
I put my hand on your chest  
I can feel your heart  
And it's beating kinda fast, so is mine  
In this moment of silence, you look me in the eyes  
Nothing is verbalized, but so much is said  
I need you so much  
The more I'm away from you, the more of you I want  
Oooh, oooh

[Verse 2]  
We're going to a whole 'nother level  
When we do it, it's so true  
And it's so much more than sexual tonight  
When we're connected, every touch, every kiss is perfected  
It's like when we finally found what we been looking for  
It gets better and better with time  
This is deeper than love  
The more of you I have the more of you I want  
Oooh, oooh

Tell me that you wanna make love, yeah
