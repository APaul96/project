Lordy, it was love at first bite  
Well, she ate it

Even Eve in eden  
Voices tried deceivin'  
With lies to show the lady the way  
At first she stopped and turned  
And tried to walk away  
  
Man, he was believer  
Lady was deceiver  
So the story goes, but you see  
The snake was he and she just climbed right up his tree  
  
So, she ate it  
Lordy, it was love at first bite  
She ate it  
Never knowin' wrong for right, right, right

When lady luck took him by surprise  
Her sweet and bitter fruits  
Surely opened his eyes  
  
Evil came like rain  
And who knows who's to blame  
And something tried to lay her to waste  
And all she want to need was just a little taste  
  
So, she ate it  
Lordy, it was love at first bite  
Yeah, she ate it  
Never knowin' wrong for right, right, right, right

"Crazy little child

Had him put away  
Nothing they could say  
Could ever make the pieces fit  
  
Aw well, Daddy-o was rich  
Mama was a bitch  
Living wasn't easy in between  
Behind his silent scream  
Jackson in his teens  
Was planning his escape  
  
He was a crazy little child  
New Orleans Alley playground  
Grimy faced  
He watched the hookers cry  
Winos were his friends  
And when he talked to them  
They said, ""Jackson, boy, they'll get you by and by""  
  
Depression settin' in  
Desp'rate, cool and quick  
Jackson learned the ropes out on the street  
Little candy stores  
Just pickin' locks and doors  
Was practice for a two bit petty thief  
  
So Jackson went to Ritz  
And ev'ryone was hip  
Ritz ran all the rackets there in town  
If you need another boy  
A trigger or a blade  
Well, I'm the slickest cat around  
  
Yeah, Ritz gave him the eye  
Once over, then he smiled  
""Yeah, I've got something here in mind  
If you meet me here at two  
I think you'll like the view  
Of that long green when you crack that safe tonight""

Well, I'll wait for you outside  
And I'll be your ears and your eyes  
And boy, you just slip in there and bring out all that loot  
But Ritz was taken by surprise  
Couple of unspectin' guys  
And they left poor Jackson inside  
  
Questions there were few  
In fact there were none  
When those Sheriff's bullets start to fly  
Lay dying on the floor  
With a smokin' forty four  
He said, ""I must admit the winos were right""  
  
Crazy little child  
Never got to see  
All the pretty things in life  
We buried him today  
Nothing we could say  
Could ever make the pieces fit

"I got my invitation to the annual levity ball  
Seeing the location is within the mirrored room  
Walking in my room I found I had nothing to find  
I got into my evening wear and left my clothes behind  
I sat down at the stairway seven hours at a time  
Writing all of this poetry that I knew would never rhyme  
The memory I know I must have had when I came in  
Was of some place I'd never ever been  
And then in came a cake all decorated in my name  
With four paper brown candles are all spelling out this name  
The clock was passing out from time to time  
I saw it all at the beginning of the ending of my first levity ball

I guess they thought that I was really it  
  
She sat down on my lap and said to me  
""I'm twenty three and I need someone  
You look like someone who could play with me  
Stay with me, all day with me""  
  
Cause I'm in no man's land  
Can't seem to find a real man  
You know I'm lookin' for a steel man  
She said I'm in no man's land  
I'm gonna show you a real good time  
I'd gladly pay you double overtime  
  
She was beggin' to be mine, but my job was on the line  
Should I say or should I go? I just didn't know... Hmmmm  
  
I left fifty kids standin' in line, they were whining, they were crying  
and their mothers they were screaming in hysterics and I swear  
I never heard such profanity  
  
I dropped my suit on the floor  
they were trying to block the door  
They were calling her a whore  
They were driven to nativities insanity  
We drove away in her Mercedes Benz, dirty blond split ends in the breeze  
She said ""I want to put you under my tree  
You're just a little gift from me to me""  
  
Cause I'm in no man's land  
Can't seem to find a real man  
You know I'm lookin' for a steel man  
She said I'm in no man's land  
You know I'm ready for a real good time  
I'd gladly pay you double overtime  
  
She had money all her life  
She wasn't lookin' to become my wife  
She said, ""I hope you understand  
I just want a nightful of man, Sonny""  
  
She didn't notice I was thin with a delicate chin  
Nor the softness of my skin, nor the scent of my other personalities  
She didn't see through my disguise - didn't see it in my eyes  
She was in for a surprise when she discovered my emotional plurality  
  
She said ""Come and lay down on the floor with me  
It's warmer here by the fire""  
She didn't know that there was more of me  
She'd have to learn to love all four of me  
  
Cause I'm in no man's land  
I'm lookin' for the real me, If only I could feel me  
You know I'm in no man's land  
Sometimes I gotta play me, It's really hard to stay me  
Hey, I'm in no mans land  
I'm looking for the real me, If only I could feel me  
You know I'm in no man's land  
Sometimes I gotta play me, It's really hard to stay me  
Oh, I'm in no man's land

It starts off, ""The coffee tasted so fine""  
It says, ""One day, this may find you,  
These few words may just remind you.  
We sat here together just to pass time,  
You said how the coffee tasted so fine. ""  
It goes on to say, ""I love you.  
If you should find this I must hear from you. ""  
It gives a number but the name has faded away.  
All that is left are just the words, ""Maybe someday""  
That's the story and the fable,  
Never leave alone from a corner table.  
Doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo doo,  
Doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo doo, doo doo.

"Got your finger on the trigger  
Your cold eyes taking aim

Let the bullets fly  
Tell me has one of them got my name?

What about the emptiness inside  
It doesn't just fade away  
Turning the knife  
How much can I bleed

I can't find no salvation  
Can't find no healing touch

A stranger in your eyes

In your crystal ball  
I'm asking you what can I do

And I can't hold on much longer  
So I've come to you my friend  
For now my life seems at an end  
  
I came to see you once before  
One hundred years ago

Be careful how you dry your hair  
In a room within a room  
In a hole within a hole  
You've got to learn to share your secrets  
Or you'll lose your soul  
  
I've got the evidence  
I know you broke  
The unwritten law  
Another town, another one night stand  
You know, you broke the law...  
  
It's so hard to hold back  
When the fire is in your eyes  
A silver dollar in my pocket  
I don't like surprises

I took out much more than I put in  
And I felt the pain  
In a dirty little room  
With nowhere left to hide  
You told the truth with your eyes

"Don't get me started, let's get it right  
There's no use to talk about it deep into the night  
Don't ask about secrets I could tell  
I'm gonna keep them to myself  
  
No bad decisions, no good advice  
No time to think about it even once or twice  
No second chances looking down the road  
When there's the only way, only way to go  
  
Oh it makes me wonder  
What's going on inside my head  
Well could it be the pressure that I'm under  
Makes me forget the things I never said  
  
I can't remember, I can't forget  
Take it from me there's not a moment of regret  
Since the day I learned to tie my shoes  
I found it hard to spread the news  
  
Oh it makes me wonder  
What's going on inside my head  
Well could it be the pressure that I'm under  
Makes me forget the things I never said  
  
It's hard to swallow, it's hard to take  
When I think about it now my knees begin to shake  
Never came to me to mention at the time  
Tell the truth it never crossed my mind  
  
Oh it makes me wonder  
What's going on inside my head  
Well could it be the pressure that I'm under  
Makes me forget the things I never said  
  
Oh it makes me wonder  
What's going on inside my head  
Could it be the pressure that I'm under  
Makes me forget the things I never said

Out of the game

Sure put me straight  
You don't get back fourteen years  
In just one day

If I'd known what to say  
Instead of makin' love  
We both made our separate ways  
But now I hear you found somebody new  
And that I never meant that much to you  
To hear that tears me up inside

I'm climbin' through the wreckage  
Of all my twisted dreams  
And this cheap investigation  
Just can't stifle all my screams

At the crossroads  
Waiting for you  
Waiting for you  
Where are you  
  
No one's gonna bother me anymore  
No one's gonna mess with my head no more  
I can't understand what all the fightin's for

Why you should stay  
Maybe we'd be better off without you anyway  
I got a one way ticket on your last chance ride  
Got a one way ticket to your suicide  
Got a one way ticket and there's no way out alive  
  
And all this crass communication that has left you in the cold  
Isn't much for consolation when you feel so weak and old  
But if home is where the heart is  
Then there's stories to be told  
No, you don't need a doctor  
No one else can heal your soul  
  
Got your mind in submission  
Got your life on the line  
But nobody pulled the trigger  
They just stepped aside  
They'll be down by the water  
While you watch 'em wavin' goodbye  
  
They'll be callin' in the morning  
They'll be hanging on the phone  
They'll be waitin' for an answer  
But you know nobody's home  
And when the bells stop ringing  
It was nobody's fault but your own  
  
There were always ample warning  
There were always subtle signs  
And you would have seen them coming  
But we gave you too much time  
And when you said that no one's listening  
Why'd your best friend drop a dime  
Sometimes we get so tired of waiting for a  
Way to spend our time  
  
And it's so easy to be social  
It's so easy to be cool  
Yeah, its easy to get hungry  
When you ain't got shit to lose  
And I wish that I could help you  
With what you hope to find  
But I'm still out here waiting  
Watching reruns of my life  
When you reach the point of breaking  
Know it's gonna take some time  
To heal those broken memories  
That another man would need  
Just to survive

Sometimes I could give up

To the innocent and young  
Whoa listen to who's talking

You tell me who's to blame  
  
I know you don't want to hear me crying  
An I know you don't want to hear me deny  
That your satisfaction lies in your illusions

We judge a book by it's cover  
And read what we want  
Between selected lines

"Gonna find a way to cure this loneliness  
Yeah I'll find a way to cure the pain  
If I said that you're my friend  
And our love would never end  
How long before I had your trust again  
I opened up the doors when it was cold outside  
Hopin' that you'd find your own way in  
But how can I protect you  
Or try not to neglect you  
When you won't take the love I have to give  
I bought me an illusion  
An I put it on the wall  
I let it fill my head with dreams  
And I had to have them all  
But oh the taste is never so sweet  
As what you'd believe it is -  
Well I guess it never is  
It's these prejudiced illusions  
That pump the blood  
To the heart of the biz  
  
You know I never thought  
That it could take so long  
You know I never knew how to be strong  
Yeah, I let you shape me  
But it feels as though you raped me  
'Cause you climbed inside my world  
And in my songs  
So now I've closed the door  
To keep the cold outside  
Seems somehow I've found the will to live  
But how can I forget you  
Or try not to reject you  
When we both know it takes time to forgive  
  
Sweetness is a virtue  
And you lost your virtue long ago  
You know I'd like to hurt you  
But my conscience always tells me no  
You could sell your body on the street  
To anyone whom you might meet  
Who'd love to try and get inside  
And bust your innocence open wide  
  
'Cause my baby's got a locomotive  
My baby's gone off the track  
My baby's got a locomotive  
Got ta peel the bitch off my back  
I know it looks like I'm insane  
Take a closer look I'm not to blame  
No  
  
Gonna have some fun with my frustrations  
Gonna watch the big screen in my head  
I'd rather take a detour  
'cause this road ain't gettin' clearer  
Your train of thought has cut me off again  
Better tame that boy 'cause he's a wild one  
Better tame that boy for he's a man  
Sweetheart don't make me laugh  
You's gettin' too big for your pants  
And I's think maybe you should  
Cut out while you can  
You can use your illusion -  
Let it take you where it may  
We live and learn  
And then sometimes it's best to walk away  
Me I'm just here hangin' on  
It's my only place to stay at least  
For now anyway  
I've worked too hard for my illusions  
Just to throw them all away  
  
I'm taking time quiet consolation  
In passing by this love that's passed away  
I know it's never easy  
So why should you believe me  
When I've always got so many things to say  
Calling off the dogs a simple choice is made  
'Cause playful hearts  
Can sometimes be enraged  
You know I tried to wake you  
I mean how long could it take you  
To open up your eyes and turn the page  
  
Kindness is a treasure  
And it's one towards me you've seldom shown  
So I'd say it for a good measure  
To all the ones like you I've known  
Ya know I'd like to shave your head  
And all my friends could paint it red  
'Cause love to me's a two way street  
An all I really want is peace  
  
But my baby's got a locomotive  
My baby's gone off the track  
My baby's got a locomotive  
Got ta peel the bitch off my back  
I know it looks like I'm insane  
Take a closer look I'm not to blame  
No  
  
Affection is a blessing  
Can you find it in your sordid heart  
I tried to keep this thing ta-gether  
But the tremor tore my pad apart  
Yeah I know it's hard to face  
When all we've worked for's gone to waste  
But you're such a stupid woman  
And I'm such a stupid man  
But love like time's got its own plans  
  
'Cause my baby's got a locomotive  
My baby's gone off the track  
My baby's got a locomotive  
Got ta peel the bitch off my back  
I know it looks like I'm insane  
Take a closer look I'm not to blame  
Yeah  
If love is blind I guess I'll buy myself a cane  
  
Love's so strange

Do. Maybe we gotta be extra careful because maybe it matters more than  
We even know..

Promised never to leave me!  
This whole thing was fucked up  
Never to leave me alone!  
All men betray. All lose heart!  
I don't want to lose heart!...I want to believe

Together at the table of brotherhood!

"I was feelin' good, kinda high and cruisin'  
I was tryin' to forget someone I had been losin'  
Then you came along, surprise, surprise  
You shot me down  
I was lyin' crashed out on the ground  
You shot me down  
  
I was feelin' fine, mellowed out and easy  
I was comin' back down kinda slow and lazy  
Then you came along and fired the flame  
You shot me down  
I was lyin' burned out on the ground  
You shot me down, you shot me down  
You shot me down

"Old man, don't tell me what you did in your day  
I got problems of my own on the way  
Look you now, where the locusts abound  
Pray they don't feed on your sacred ground  
  
Vibrations, are burning my hands  
Slowly walking, stalking through these crazy lands  
Defending the need, with a silent scream  
For another time, for another dream  
  
Jack boots, hi-jacks  
Ray guns and spray guns  
We got them all for free  
Look to the stars for consolation  
It could be there lookin' at me  
Send me down a simple solution  
Send me down a simple solution now  
  
No cheap-o, clean-o, is gonna wash away my blues  
I need a good friend that's gonna give me some clues  
The one on the cross, he almost had it boss  
He was really spreading the news  
Ah, but the destruct mutt, he's back in business  
He ain't about to lose  
  
Jackboots, hi-jacks  
Ray guns and spray guns  
We got them all for free  
Look to the stars for consolation  
It could be there lookin' at me  
It could be there lookin' at me  
Send me down a simple solution  
Send me down a simple solution now  
  
And the price-for life  
Is one more run on that chicken wire  
As the hero returns  
With eyes of fire  
To another man to man, so damn you man!  
  
Old man don't tell me what you did in your day  
I got problems of my own on the way  
So look you now, where the locusts abound  
Prat they don't feed on your sacred ground.

Mist upon the hill can remember murder,  
Mist upon the hill that once flowed with blood,  
Helped to cover up an approaching army,  
Hid the killing lust in the eyes of men.  
  
Sitting by the fire was a sentry sleeping,  
Rolled up in their beds were children that play,  
Unsuspecting what was to fall upon them,  
None of them would see the dawn next day.  
  
Bloody were the blades that fell on children,  
Hate the blinding light tried to kill a name,  
The mountains only know all the souls that died there,  
Glen coe from that day can recall the shame.  
  
The quiet of the night never gave them warning,  
The silence of the hills wouldn't let them know,  
They'd never rise again on a mist filled morning,  
Never see the sunrise above glen coe.

"When Willie met Ronnie he was runnin' up a track  
He was bent down, burned out, carryin' a sack  
Come on boy, you got to stop and help me some  
And keep this money hidden when the police come  
  
Ronnie was shiverin' and makin' funny sounds  
He was lookin' like a fox  
That was runnin' from the hounds  
Sure little buddy, I can lighten up your load  
  
You half it up, I'll hit it up, I'll take it down the road  
  
Never had a better combination been planned  
'Cause Willie was a roadie with a rock 'n' roll band  
They were heads back, celebratin', drinkin' moonshine  
Heads down, here we go across another state line  
  
Tanked up and bullet proof  
They couldn't give a monkey's  
Damn if he didn't hide the money in a drum case  
Pack 'em up, hit em up, do another show  
  
The robber and the roadie got a long way to go  
  
Willie and Ronnie  
  
Anytime they wanted they would pull another job  
Anywhere they found a place  
And it was fat enough to rob  
If Ronnie saw the police he would make a little sign  
  
Then Willie stuck the money in the band's back line  
In the main racks, bass stacks  
Anywhere he thought it could  
Be hidden out of sight  
  
Until the finished out in Hollywood  
Split it down the middle  
When they took it out the sound  
The robber and the roadie got enough to go around  
  
Willie and Ronnie  
The robber and the roadie  
  
Forty seven days and they had only one to go  
When the telegram arived  
To say the band wouldn't show  
The crowd was getting' nasty and it turned into a rage  
  
The bottles and the bodies started coverin' the stage  
Then the cops came running in  
And breaking up the riotin'  
When they saw the money falling  
  
Out the back of everything  
Hey little buddy think it's time to run and duck  
The robber and the roadie could be runnin' out of luck  
  
Willie and Ronnie had to skip it out of town  
They were sittin' by the highway like Jackson Browne  
They were stickin' out their thumbs  
In the middle of the night  
  
When they saw the car comin' with the spinnin' red light  
Wide eyed, tongue tied feelin' pretty stranded  
No use in runnin' they were caught red handed  
Pull 'em in, lock 'em up, put 'em in a row  
The robber and the roadie got nowhere to go  
  
Willie and Ronnie  
The robber and the roadie  
  
We got state police and the FBI  
Willie and Ronnie  
You get a big reward  
If you can make these boy's mamas cry  
The robber and the roadie  
We got the national guard and the bear in the sky  
  
Willie and Ronnie  
You get a big reward if you can make these mothers cry

Watch them till I'm fast asleep,

Leave old pictures in the past  
Donate every dime you have?  
Would you call old friends you never see?  
Reminisce old memories  
Would you forgive your enemies?  
Would you find that one you're dreamin' of?  
Swear up and down to God above  
That you finally fall in love  
If today was your last day  
  
If today was your last day  
Would you make your mark by mending a broken heart?  
You know it's never too late to shoot for the stars  
Regardless of who you are  
So do whatever it takes  
Cause you can't rewind a moment in this life  
Let nothin' stand in your way  
Cause the hands of time are never on your side

He sold his mother's rings, she said nothing,

I'd like to make that Fraulein mine, mein Fraulein  
So I'll depart sweetheart and leave you with this line  
  
With love  
She says she won't be back no more

No matter where you are, Au Revoir

But it didn't make him feel any better

There are those who will spend a lifetime of leisure  
'Til the leisure finally takes control  
And they'll spend their life in search of pleasure  
Never knowing the treasure that they own  
  
There are those who will spend a lifetime in hard labor  
'Til the labor breaks both body and soul  
And they will learn to love their neighbor

A Night In The Life Of A Blues Singer  
(Lynott)  
In the old days  
I could sing the blues  
I had nothin' to live for  
And nothin' to lose  
And all the time  
I was paying my dues  
Like an old blues singer  
And I had no troubles then  
But I had lots of friends  
Friends they come and go  
And sometimes friendship ends  
All the time, I've had a friend on whom I depend  
So blues singer  
Oh...  
Oh mama, mama, mama, this is your boy  
Oh mama, mama, mama, mama, my soul's been destroyed  
Oh mama, mama, your pride and joy  
Is a blues singer  
An old blues singer  
And the party's over now  
Everybody's goin' home  
The band is packin' up  
And I'm on my own  
Oh, but I miss you now you're gone  
Mama, your boy's a blues singer  
Such an old blues singer  
Nothin, oh but nothin's changed  
Oh sometimes you win sometimes you lose  
I lost ya mama  
I lost ya mama  
In the old days  
I could sing the blues  
Had nothin' to live for  
And nothin' to lose  
But all the time  
You must chose  
I'm an old blues singer  
Oh...

"The sacred heart is bleeding  
Go tell the Holy Ghost  
That the junkie is still cheating  
To get the thing he needs the most  
  
Lady Luck has me covered  
Keeping her watchful eyes over me

The charge is first degree

"Oh my God  
There's millions of them  
  
I've seen a fire start in Frisco  
The day that the earth quaked  
I've seen buildings a-blazing  
Throwing up in flames  
  
I heard men, women and children  
Crying out to their God for mercy  
But their God didn't listen  
So they were burned alive  
  
They went down, down, deep underground  
In the great disaster  
  
I was hanging out in Berlin  
In the year one thousand nine hundred and thirty nine  
I've seen Hitler's storm troopers

I've seen men send rockets out into space  
I foresee a holocaust  
An angel of death descending to destroy the human race  
  
Down, down, deep underground  
A great disaster  
  
In the sixteenth century there was a French philosopher  
By the name of Nostradamus  
Who prophesied that in the late twentieth century  
An angel of death shall waste this land  
  
A holocaust the likes of which  
This planet had never seen  
Now, I ask you  
Do you believe this to be true  
  
I was standing by the bedside  
The night that my father died  
He was crying out in pain  
To his God he said, have mercy, mercy  
  
His body was riddled with a disease  
Unknown to man so he expected no cure  
But before he died that night  
He was lost, insane  
  
He went down, down, deep underground  
A great disaster  
  
You'll go down, down, deep underground  
A great disaster

"The friendly ranger paused  
And scooping a bowl of beans  
Spreading them like stars  
Falling like justice on different scenes  
  
""I'm damned""  
""indeed, comrade""  
""I'm being bombed""  
And all the people's faces turned strawberry blonde  
  
By the morning gate the friendly ranger waits  
For the sun making sure it's not late  
""just in time"" ""no need to fear"" ""well, just in case""  
And all the people are happy for another year  
  
And in the evening shade he climbs upon the sun  
Getting it's glow  
He goes on  
Singing this song  
  
To feel the goodness glowing inside  
To walk down a street with my arms about your hips, side by side  
To play with a sad eyed child till he smiles  
To look at a starry sky at night, realize the miles  
  
To see the sun set behind the steeple  
Clontarf castle, no king, queen or knightly people  
A coal fire and it's pouring rain  
To wave goodbye to a very good friend, never meet again  
Little thoughts bring little memories of you to me

"The hero he rode a white horse  
Across the desert to where his woman was  
He'd been riding for four days  
When he saw the tower where she was locked  
  
In the moonlight he left his old steed  
Near the drawbridge that he crossed  
And by way of a rope ladder  
He tip-toed to where his woman was

Who followed the stars  
Searching for  
The lost city of Mars  
  
Hoping time would heal the scars  
Knowing fate held no bars  
Are you the one  
That I think you are?  
  
Are you the hero or are you the madman?  
  
The madman climbed  
The steeple spire  
""Go higher"" said the crowd  
From down below  
  
""But, the world's on fire"" cried the madman  
From the steeple spire  
""You're a liar"" cried the crown  
From down below  
  
The madman climbed the steeple spire  
And let a crystal ball tear  
Fall on the crown  
From down below  
  
If I recall you're the actor  
Who took to the stage  
Set the world ablaze  
With your anger and your rage  
  
With every new leaf

Cleverly concealing  
Your real age

Are you the one  
Who can take this praise?

Since I signed up I've been living in a trance  
  
Running up the highway looking for something  
Looking for something I can't see  
Running up the highway looking for something  
Looking for something I can't see  
  
I'm feeling sick like dawn of the dead  
I've got marines marching through my head  
John-boy Walton, he's so nice  
So come in this must be paradise  
  
All your dreams will come true  
That lovely mansion with it's pool so blue  
A red Ferrari and a model for a wife  
Oh yes it looks I was born for the good life  
  
Running up the highway looking for something  
Looking for something I can't see  
Running up the highway looking for something  
Looking for something I can't see

"Say sayonara darling

Like a twisted wreck  
Let's save ourselves the sorrow  
Before we hit the deck  
  
From the high plains  
To the border  
All across the land  
From the flying of the flag  
To lovers kissing hands  
  
You can cover me in roses  
Put nickles on my eyes  
There be no tomorrows,  
No more goodbyes  
Sea of faith  
Where did she go  
Little diamonds  
How you shine and glow  
Looking at the future I don't know  
I am just here to watch the river flow  
  
A street full of whispers,  
Rings like a chinese gong  
A room full of would be's  
Whose lives have gone wrong  
  
The blues don't exist now  
Just to cleanse your soul  
They were made to wake you up  
Not to dig a hole  
  
You can cover me in roses,  
Put nickles on my eyes  
There be no tomorrows,  
No more goodbyes

It would make you weep  
When you kiss your love goodnight

Drive me crazy, you drive me wild  
Get home form work I don't feel all right  
Go in your bedroom you just want to fight  
Movin' in , movin' out, baby you move my mind about  
Don't give me no reason, don't give me no lies  
Come to take you home from school you've brokin' all the rules

"[disputed lyrics in brackets]  
Have you ever had the time to see, me and you could change to be  
Take a dream away with you live it now and you will see  
Found myself on an open road [got no hand] to show the way  
Upped and started walking on to a land seemed so far away  
After so long felt I was damned then I reached some gates and held a hand  
But came to the point of sing and say, laughing people led me in to stay  
Their happiness [held me, made me ] strong. I felt this is where I belong  
I don't want another day just wanna laugh live sing and say  
It's so strange I feel this way, it's so real, it's happening today,  
Stop still something burns my body falls I begin to turn  
(instrumental verse)  
Flying drifting falling down, I found myself beneath the ground,  
In a place that's strange to me, the earth is black and there's not a tree  
Well it's so dark there's not a sound just the feeling of wanting to be found  
I must make haste to be gone, in this place I do not belong  
I thought I tried to move a foot, I just remained where I stood,  
And in the distance I heard aloud the shrill of blank deathly sound  
I tried, I tried, I tried to run, but every move I was where I begun,  
It's too late, shadows over me blind my eyes I cannot see  
All my strength all my love, someone help me please above,  
Death will surely take me down, I'll be doomed to live beneath the ground  
(instrumental)  
[see your two, see your one,] see your tomb, see you run, you fool, you fool
your life has just begun  
I'm here to taunt and torment you  
I can make you do what I want you to  
Black it out and drag you down, all kinds of evil wear a crown  
Chase you rape you feast upon your hurt, lay your body in the dirt  
If I were a fool I'd believe it's true but I have no fear of what you can do  
See I'm free I can be just anyone that I want to be  
Leave me now get out of my way  
(instrumental)  
[see your two, see your one] see your tomb, see your rock, who are you fooling
life's just begun  
Here to taunt, to torment you  
I can make you do what I want you to,  
Knock it out drag you down, all kinds of people were aware of it now?  
Chase you rape you feast upon your hurt, lay your body in the dirt  
If I were a fool I'd believe it's true but I have no fear of what you can do  
See I'm free so leave me alone I wanna go my way and be alone  
Get out of my sight, get out of my way  
(more instrumental)  
I'm not through, and I'm on the run, you're the fool my life's not been done  
I'll taunt you and I'll torment you  
(instrumental)  
Have this way with a dream never leave me so it seems  
Life by night, life by day, the tale they tell will always stay  
Walk the earth, walk the sky, don't let all this time go by  
Hang on fast, don't let go or someone else will never know  
Ride a road along with me chase a dream we all can see  
Don't let bad, just see good it's all that just what you should  
No truth will ever come along shine so bright in your eyes  
No wide wonder will do that for you, just lock it fast, do what you got to do  
Shout it loud, shout out loud just live how you want to be  
Show yourself show yourself, live how you got to be

Lying there all still lying there upon the sand  
A big silver bird had planted itself into the ground  
And being the kind of person who isn't very easily alarmed  
Decided to take a walk to see just what I could find  
Walked around the walls, tapping to find me a door  
Looking for a windows to see if I could find out more  
Big silver bird let me inside your plane  
Want to fly so high fly me high, away  
All of a sudden the door slid back and someone was there  
A strange kind of being spoke to me in my tongue  
""step inside, we'll take you away in our plane  
We'll fly you so high, you'll never have the chance to complain  
To leave this earth, never even (? ? ? ) ...  
Stepping inside I fixed myself into a seat

"She came to me one morning, one lonely Sunday morning,  
Her long hair flowing in the mid-winter wind.  
I know not how she found me, for in darkness I was walking,  
And destruction lay around me from a fight I could not win.  
  
She asked me name my foe then. I said the need within some men  
To fight and kill their brothers without thought of love or god.  
And I begged her give me horses to trample down my enemies,  
So eager was my passion to devour this waste of life.  
  
But she would not think of battle that reduces men to animals,  
So easy to begin and yet impossible to end.  
For she the mother of all men had counseled me so wisely that  
I feared to walk alone again and asked if she would stay.  
  
""Oh lady lend your hand,"" I cried, ""Oh let me rest here at your side.""  
""Have faith and trust in me,"" she said and filled my heart with life.  
There is no strength in numbers. I've no such misconceptions.  
But when you need me be assured I won't be far away.  
  
Thus having spoke she turned away and though I found no words to say  
I stood and watched until I saw her black cloak disappear.  
My labor is no easier, but now I know I'm not alone.  
I find new heart each time I think upon that windy day.  
And if one day she comes to you drink deeply from her words so wise.  
Take courage from her as your prize and say hello for me.

A blessing or a curse  
No, I can't ignore it  
For better or for worse  
It wakes me when I'm sleeping  
A thief that takes my breath away  
  
And I find myself  
Reaching for a lifeline  
Throw me a lifeline and  
Bring me back in time  
I need a lifeline, throw me a lifeline  
I'm going down for the last time  
  
Sometimes I can't control it  
Sometimes it isn't there at all  
Sometimes I try to roll it

Slowly, surely it unfolded  
Its simple lines just as  
A pole wind told it

With a lapse of illusion

We were all for one, one for all  
All for one, one for all  
Nothing could stop us, we had it all  
We were all for one, one for all  
I always knew  
You had dreams of your own  
But I can't understand you  
So many words, too much to say  
And nothing to hold on to  
And so another day must end  
In this loneliness  
Another season  
Another time, I guess  
All for one, we were all for one  
All for one, strong in body and soul  
All for one, and  
Nothing's gonna stop us  
All for one, one for all ...

Rough justice, I've had my share  
I've done my time  
But I'm still running scared  
Rough justice  
Coming down on me  
Long arm of the law  
Never setting me free  
Rough justice, I bide my time  
  
Back in action, I'm riding the crest  
And putting all that  
I've learned to the test  
No complications  
Taking it day by day  
Freedom of movement  
Freedom of choice  
Free to be right back here  
With the boys  
Ready to listen

And they overflow LIKE cotton candy  
And battlegrounds  
Red and Brown

On little things like

Alright  
You sacrificed  
And worked all your life  
But now you're  
Bleeding, crying all for nothing  
Nothing  
You waiting for that day  
And you're always praying  
For the gates  
To finally open, open  
Into my stronghold  
You will never take my  
Stronghold  
Yeah  
Well you can bring  
And army's might  
But I will always fight  
Until the end, the end  
You can never break  
Through my walls  
And I'll never fall  
What's mine I will defend

"Getting dressed for the masquerade  
To be the main attraction  
Might become someone someday  
With the right connection

I just want to go with ecstasy  
To the river of love I run  
Teaser you set my heart on fire  
Teaser put out the flames of my desire  
If you let me stay inside  
I give satisfaction  
In the night we might lose our way  
In the tunnel of love I ride

Ohh I guess we all need someone

I dwell inside the shadows.  
But I wasn't always this alive.  
Since you hung me from the gallows.  
You know I love the night.  
And I love the darkness.  
As I cruise along the highway.  
Now there is no more light.  
And there is no more sweetness.  
I will always have it my way.  
Well, I am the ghost inside your head.  
And I will rock your world from dusk to dawn.  
Don't you cry for those who bled.  
Cause I will rock your world from dusk to dawn.

And don't believe in what you hear.  
Don't you worry, it's only me.

You'll never grow old  
No armor or sword will save your soul  
  
Clash of lance, clash of shield  
In the end you must yield
