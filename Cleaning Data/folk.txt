"Traditional, arranged  
By Arlo Guthrie  
Come all you old time cowboys  
And listen to my song  
Please do not grow weary  
I'll not detain you long  
Concerning some wild cowboys  
Who did agree to go  
And spend the summer pleasant  
On the range of the buffalo.  
Well I found myself in Griffin  
In eighteen eighty-three  
When a man by the name of Creagho  
Come a'walkin' up to me  
Sayin ""How do you do young fella  
And how'd you like to go  
And spend the summer pleasant  
On the range of the buffalo"".  
Well me being out of work right then  
To that drover I did say  
""My goin' out on the buffalo range  
Depends upon the pay  
But if you pay good wages,  
Transportation to and fro  
I think I might go with you  
On the range of the Buffalo"".  
Well yes I pay good wages  
And transportation too  
If you'll agree to work for me  
Until the season's through  
But if you do get homesick  
And you try and run away  
You'll starve to death out on the trail  
And you'll also lose your pay  
Well with all the flatterin' talkin'  
He signed up quite a train  
Some ten or twelve in number  
Of able bodied men  
And our trip it was a pleasant one  
Through all New Mexico  
Until we crossed Pease River  
On the range of the buffalo  
It was there our pleasures ended  
And our troubles all begun  
A lightnin' storm come up on us  
And made the cattle run  
We got full of the stickers  
On the cactus that did grow  
And the outlaws waited to pick us off  
In the hills of Mexico  
Well the working season ended  
But the drover would not pay  
He said ""You spent your money boys  
You're all in debt to me"".  
But the cowboys never put much stock  
In a thing like a bankrupt law  
So we left the bastard's bones to bleach  
On the range of the buffalo.

"Words and music by Arlo Guthrie  
I remember when I met you  
Underneath the evening sky  
Now it seems I could forget you  
Rescue me, I'm bound to die  
All the promises we made there  
With no words to understand  
And though I've tried I've come up empty  
Heart of stone, drowning man  
CHORUS:  
I'm going down for the third time  
And I need a helping hand  
The rooster crows and I'm sinking  
Heart of stone, drowning man  
Where are you, my dear companion  
How much longer must you be  
I'm all alone out on the ocean  
When will you come and rescue me  
It's too late for new beginnings  
In this world I've left behind  
There is nothing left worth keeping  
Not a thing to change my mind  
CHORUS  
How far down the road to glory  
Must we go without a sign  
Caught out on these stormy waters  
How can you treat me so unkind  
Did you know from the beginning  
That I'd dig this lousy hole  
Oh, don't leave me here abandoned  
In this dark night of the soul

"Gonna sit right here and sing myself a tune  
That I wrote one afternoon after everyone had gone

Old dog is lying in the middle of the road  
He don't do nothing 'cause he don't want to  
And I think I'm gonna like that hound  
'Cause the more he sits around, the less I want to do too  
Gonna sit right here and watch the world roll by  
Till we both just up and die watching clouds and eating flies  
Don't want to bother no one, don't want nothing here to change  
A dusty road is all we've ever dreamed of  
And I think I'm gonna love this life  
Maybe someday take a wife  
She can join us if she wants to  
Ain't nobody gonna tell what to do  
If a car comes we just move  
And we both move real smooth  
Like old dog is moving must be something in the air  
Some bitch is coming up the road now  
And I think I'm gonna like that hound  
'Cause the more he gets around, the more I want to do too

"Of war and peace the truth just twists, its curfew gull it glides  
Upon four legged forest clouds the cowboy angel rides  
With his candle lit into the sun though it's glow is waxed in black  
All except beneath the trees of Eden  
The lamp post stands with folded arms its iron claws attached  
To curbs 'neath holes where babies wail  
Through its shadow's metal badge  
All in all can only fall with a crashing but meaningless blow  
No sound ever comes from the Gates of Eden  
The savage soldier sticks his head in the sand and then complains  
Unto the shoeless hunter who's gone deaf but still remains  
Upon the beach where hound dogs bay at ships with tattooed sails  
Heading for the Gates of Eden  
The time rusted compass blade, Aladdin and his lamp  
Sits with Utopian hermit monks, side saddle on the Golden Calf  
And on their promises of paradise you will not hear a laugh  
All except inside the Gates of Eden  
Relationships of ownership they whisper in the wings  
To those condemned to act accordingly and wait for succeeding kings  
And I try to harmonize with songs the lonesome sparrow sings  
There are no kings inside the Gates of Eden  
The motorcycle 'Black Madonna', two-wheeled gypsy queen  
And her silver-studded phantom cause the gray flannel dwarf to scream  
As he weeps to wicked birds of prey, pick up on his bread crumb sins  
And there are no sins inside the Gates of Eden  
The kingdoms of experience in the precious winds they rot  
While paupers change possessions  
Each one wishing for what the other has got  
And the princess and the prince discuss what's real and what's not  
It doesn't matter inside the Gates of Eden  
The foreign sun it squints upon a bed that is never mine  
As friends and others, strangers from their fates try to resign  
Leaving men holy and totally free to do anything they wish to do but die  
And there are no trials inside the Gates of Eden  
At dawn my lover comes to me and tells me of her dreams  
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse  
Into the ditch of what each one means  
At times I think there are no words but these to tell what's true  
And there are no truths outside the Gates of Eden

That last long day she said goodbye  
Well Lawd, I thought I would cry  
She'd do me, she'd do you,  
She's got that kind of lovin'  
Lawd, I love to hear her  
When she calls me sweet daddy  
  
Such a beautiful dream  
I hate to think it's all over  
I lost my heart it seems  
I've grown so used to you somehow  
But I'm nobody's sugar daddy now  
And I'm lonesome, I got the lovesick blues  
  
I'm in love, I'm in love with a beautiful gal  
That's what's the matter with me  
I'm in love, I'm in love with a beautiful gal  
But she don't care about me  
  
Lawd I tried and tried to keep her satisfied  
But she just wouldn't stay  
So now that she is leavin'  
This is all I say...

"Words and music by Robb (Rabbitt) MacKay  
Some times when the sun goes down  
And I'm lost in some other town  
My thoughts may drift away  
To Manzanillo Bay  
And I can see a fisherman  
His day's catch Iying on the sand  
Underneath the palms that sway  
Over Manzanillo Bay  
CHORUS:  
Now I'm missing your silver moon  
Black sands and your blue lagoon  
Some day I would like to be  
Back next to your shining sea  
Drinking rum from a conch shell  
Caught up in your magic spell  
Some day I would like to go  
Back down to Mexico  
I remember your fields of cane  
Your warm breezes and jungle rains  
And watching the children play  
Over Manzanillo Bay  
And out in your market square  
The women sing out to sell their wares  
I've got fresh shrimp today  
From Manzanillo Bay  
CHORUS  
And under the spell of night  
The bay reflecting the harbor light  
You can hear the guitar play  
Over Manzanillo Bay  
And if you're thinking about romance  
And you're willing to take a chance  
Just pick any small cafe  
In Manzanillo Bay  
CHORUS  
Some times when the sun goes down  
And I'm lost in some other town  
My thoughts may drift away  
To Manzanillo Bay

"Like a dream in the night

There's a fire burning bright  
In Massachusetts  
And there's a house upon a hill

We will be in Massachusetts

And there's a day that must go on  
There's another night that's gone

Tired of the glamor, tired of the sights

Back to my home on the old river shore  
I am sad and weary far away from home

Days are dark and dreary everywhere I roam  
Miss the Mississippi and you  
Roaming the wide world over  
Always along and blue, so blue  
Nothing seems to cheer me under heaven's dome  
Miss the Mississippi and you  
Memories are bringing happy days of yore  
Miss the Mississippi and you dear  
Mocking birds are singing 'round the cabin door

"Words and music by James Rider  
  
Just me and a friend roamin' around  
Him a magician and I was a clown  
Playin' the streets for a dollar a day  
Waitin' for the right time and a sign to lead the way  
  
Crossed over the border to a mystical land  
Sort of unexpected didn't quite understand  
On a razor's edge on a grain of sand  
Onward we wandered to the gates of oblivion  
  
On a roll of the dice we headed out west  
Where the sage and and the spice attracted us  
Shadows fell down like a dark groping hand  
Saw the teeth of the wolves and the blood of the lambs  
  
On a turn of the cards I lightened my load  
Throwing off fear for the weakness it holds  
On target and calm the vision was clear  
Beyond the mirage I took for granted was here  
  
On a flip of the coins we rode the coast  
Tryin' to make the most of every situation  
That we witnessed near at hand  
On a drifter's crusade all over the land  
  
Could it be in the stars in the passing of cars  
At a table in the bar in a turn of the cards  
In a change of your mind in the passing of time  
In a ribbon of rhyme just down the line  
  
Just me and a friend roamin' around  
Him a magician I was a clown  
Playin' the streets for a dollar a day  
Waitin' for the right time and a sign to lead the way

A cowboy's life is my occupation  
In the Oklahoma Hills where I was born  
  
But as I sit here today  
Many mile's I am away  
From the place I rode my pony  
Through the draw  
  
Where the oak and black-jack trees  
Kiss the playful prairie breeze  
And I feel back in those hills  
Where I belong  
  
Now as I turn life a page  
To the land of the great Osage  
In those Oklahoma hills  
Where I was born  
  
Where the black oil rolls and flows  
And the snow white cotton grows  
And I feel like in those hills

"Words and music by Arlo Guthrie  
In the event of my demise  
Be sure to include this statement  
When you are bent on closing my eyes  
Thinking about what my life meant  
Alone on a hill back in '65  
Things looked a lot like changing  
Singing our songs that we harmonized  
Dreaming of worlds rearranging  
And I don't know why I'm singing tonight  
Maybe it's time someone told you  
Just because you say you've seen the light  
Doesn't mean nobody sold you  
I can remember all of your smiles  
During the demonstrations  
Taking on what seemed like the whole world  
Igniting the hearts of our nations  
And together we sang our victory songs  
Though we were worlds apart  
Every thing then has now passed away  
Except for the love in my heart  
Sitting at home on computerized beds  
Tryine to come to conclusions  
Seeing reflections from rose-colored heads  
Ignoring the states of illusion  
Drunk in a world of material wealth  
No one can notice you falling  
Fantastic flights once good tor your health  
Now make you deaf to your calling  
And all alone the prophet groans  
With words as yet unseen  
Who'll be awake when the master returns  
Who will be lost in their dreams  
So in the event of my demise  
8e sure to include this statement  
Only the words of love kept alive  
Are worthy of not being wasted

This song is about the time that I was ridin' my motorcycle.  
Going down a mountain road, at 150 miles an hour, playin'  
My guitar. On one side of the mountain road there was a  
Mountain, and on the other side there was nothin' - there was  
A cliff in the air.  
  
Now, when you're going down a mountain road at I50 miles  
An hour you gotta be very careful, especially if you're playin'  
A guitar. Especially if that guitar is an acoustic guitar.  
Because if it's an acoustic guitar, the wind pressure is greater  
On the box side than on the neck side, because there's  
More guitar on the box side. I wasn't payin' attention..  
  
Luckily I didn't go into the mountain - I went over the cliff.  
I was goin' at 150 miles an hour sideways and 500 feet down  
At the same time.  
  
I knew it was the end. I looked down, I said ''Wow! Some  
Trip"". I thought it... Well I knew it was... I knew it was my last  
Trip, and in my last remaining seconds in world, I decided  
To write one last farewell song to the world.  
  
Put a new ink cartridge in my pen. Took out a piece of paper.  
I sat back and I thought awhile. Then I started writin':  
I don't want a pickle  
Just want to ride on my motorsickle  
And I don't want a tickle  
'Cause I'd rather ride on my motorsickle  
  
And I don't want to die  
Just want to ride on my motorcy... Cle. ""  
  
I knew that, it wasn't the best song l ever wrote, but I didn't  
Have time to change it. I was comin' down mighty fast.  
  
But as you all know, and as fate would have it, I didn't die. I  
Landed on the top of a police car. And he died. I drove away  
On the road that he was on. I came into town at a screamin'  
175 miles an hour, playin' the motorcycle song.  
  
I came into town, I jumped off my bike, the bike went around  
The corner by itself, went up on the stand by itself, turned  
Itself off.  
  
I walked over to my friend. He was standin' there eatin'  
Pickles. I said ""Hi, what's happenin'?"" He looked at me in the  
Eye and said ""Nothin'"".  
  
You gotta sing it with that kind of enthusiasm. Like you just  
Squashed a cop...

Organization. Tonight I'd like to dedicate this to our boys

Well, wait a minute. It's hard to be an FBI man. I mean, first  
Of all, being an FBI man, you have to be over 40 years old.  
And the reason is that it takes at least 25 years with the  
Organization to be that much of a bastard. It's true. You just  
Can't join, you know. It needs an atmosphere where your  
Natural bastardness can grow and develop and take a  
Meaningful shape in today's complex society.  
  
But that's not why I want to dedicate the song to the FBI. I  
Mean, the job that they have to do is a drag. I mean, they have

Run out of gasoline. I pull over to the side of the road. They  
Gotta pull over too - make believe that they ran out, you

I go to get some gasoline. They have to figure out whether  
They should stick with the car or follow me. Suppose I don't  
Come back and they're stayin' with the car.  
  
Or if I fly on the airplanes, I could fly half fare because I'm 12  
To 22. And they gotta pay the full fare. But the thing is that  
When you pay the full fare, you have to get on the airplane  
First, so that they know how many seats are left over for the  
Half fare kids. Right? And sometimes there aren't any seats  
Left over, and sometimes there are, but that doesn't mean that  
You have to go.  
  
Suppose that he gets on and fills up the last seat, so you can't  
Get on. Then he gets off then you can get on. What's he gonna

Take me to the green valley and lay the earth o'er me  
For I'm a poor cowboy and I know I've done wrong""""  
  
We beat the drum slowly and played the fife lowly  
And bitterly wept as we carried him along  
For we all loved our comrade, so brave, young and handsome  
We all loved our comrade although he done wrong

Chorus:  
This land is your land, this land is my land  
From California, to the New York Island  
From the redwood forest, to the gulf stream waters  
This land was made for you and me  
  
As I was walking a ribbon of highway  
I saw above me an endless skyway  
I saw below me a golden valley  
This land was made for you and me  
  
Chorus  
  
I've roamed and rambled and I've followed my footsteps  
To the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts  
And all around me a voice was sounding  
This land was made for you and me  
  
Chorus  
  
The sun comes shining as I was strolling  
The wheat fields waving and the dust clouds rolling  
The fog was lifting a voice come chanting  
This land was made for you and me  
  
Chorus  
  
As I was walkin' - I saw a sign there  
And that sign said - no tress passin'  
But on the other side.... It didn't say nothin!  
Now that side was made for you and me!  
  
Chorus  
  
In the squares of the city - In the shadow of the steeple  
Near the relief office - I see my people  
And some are grumblin' and some are wonderin'  
If this land's still made for you and me.

"There's gonna be some changin' 'round  
Babe, when you come turn me down  
Trifled on me for your last time  
When I come home at night  
Why you always start a fight?  
Now, babe I want you to know  
You left your motor runnin' slow  
I got off and got on a faster line  
Got me a baby that's got some dough  
When you gotta go, you gotta go  
Gonna leave you and ease  
This troubled mind of mine  
There's no need to talk to you  
'Cause you know that we are through  
I can find a better place to spend my time  
Now if I stay out late  
You know I'm swingin' on another gate  
Gonna leave you and ease this  
Troubled mind of mine  
Now baby I want you to know  
You left your motor runnin' slow  
I got off and got on a faster line  
Got me a baby that's got some sense

They love to sing this song

Can't you fell the love surround you - That's a start

Many tried but few succeed - So I'm told

"Arranged and adapted by Arlo Guthrie  
So you ask me my kind friend  
Why I am sad and still  
And why my brow is darkened  
Like the clouds upon the hill  
Rein in your ponies closer  
And I'll tell you all a tale  
Of Utah Carroll, partner  
And his last ride on the trail  
In a grave without a headstone  
Without a date or name  
My partner lies there silent  
In the land from which I came  
Long ago we rode together  
We'd ridden side by side  
I loved him like a brother  
And I wept when Utah died  
While riding up one morning  
And our work was almost done  
The cattle quickly started  
On a wild and maddening run  
The boss's little daughter  
Who was riding on that side  
Rushed in to stop the stampede  
It was there my partner died  
Lenore upon her pony  
Tried to turn the cattle right  
But her blanket slipped beneath her  
And she caught and held on tight  
When we all saw that red blanket  
Each cowboy held his breath  
For should her pony fail her  
None could save the girl from death  
When the cattle saw the blanket  
Almost dragging on the ground  
They were maddened in a moment  
And they charged with deafening sound  
The girl soon saw her danger  
And she turned her pony's face  
And bending in her saddle  
Tried the blanket to replace  
Just then she lost her balance  
In the front of that wild tide  
Carroll's voice controlled the round up  
""Lie still, Lenore"" he cried  
And then close up beside her  
Came Utah riding fast  
But little did the poor boy know  
The ride would be his last  
Full often from the saddle  
He had caught the trailing rope  
To pick her up at full speed  
Was now his only hope  
He swung low from his saddle  
To take her to his arm  
We thought that he'd succeeded  
That the girl was safe from harm  
But such a strain upon his saddle  
Had ne'er been put before  
And the cinches gave beneath him  
And he fell beside Lenore  
When the girl fell from her saddle  
She had dragged the blanket down  
It lay there close beside them  
Where they lay upon the ground  
Utah took the blanket  
And to Lenore he said  
""Lie still"" and quickly running  
Waved the red thing o'er his head  
He turned the maddened cattle  
From Lenore, his little friend  
And as the mighty herd rushed toward him  
He turned to met his end  
And as the herd came on him  
His weapon quickly drew  
He was bound to die defended  
As all brave cowboys do  
The weapon flashed like lightning  
And it sounded loud and clear  
As the cattle rushed and killed him  
He dropped the leading steer  
When I broke through that wide circle  
To where poor Utah lay  
With a thousand wounds and bruises  
His life blood ebbed away  
I knelt down close beside him  
And I knew that all was o'er  
As I heard him faintly whisper  
""Good-bye, my sweet Lenore""  
Next morning at the churchyard  
I heard the preacher say  
""Don't think our kind friend Utah  
Was lost on that great day  
He was a much-loved cowboy  
And not afraid to die  
And we'll meet him at the round up  
On the plains beyond the sky""  
So you ask me my kind friend  
Why I am sad and still  
And why my brow is darkened  
Like the clouds upon the hill  
Rein in your ponies closer  
And I'll tell you all a tale  
Of Utah Carroll, partner  
And his last ride on the trail

"Words by Adrian Mitchell, music by Arlo Guthrie  
Victor Jara of Chile  
Lived like a shooting star  
He fought for the people of Chile  
With his songs and his guitar  
His hands were gentle, his hands were strong  
Victor Jara was a peasant  
He worked from a few years old  
He sat upon his father's plow  
And watched the earth unfold  
His hands were gentle, his hands were strong  
Now when the neighbors had a wedding  
Or one of their children died  
His mother sang all night for them  
With Victor by her side  
His hands were gentle, his hands were strong  
He grew up to be a fighter  
Against the people's wrongs  
He listened to their grief and joy  
And turned them into songs  
His hands were gentle, his hands were strong  
He sang about the copper miners  
And those who worked the land  
He sang about the factory workers  
And they knew he was their man  
His hands were gentle, his hands were strong  
He campaigned for Allende  
Working night and day  
He sang ""Take hold of your brothers hand  
You know the future begins today""  
His hands were gentle, his hands were strong  
Then the generals seized Chile  
They arrested Victor then  
They caged him in a stadium  
With five-thousand frightened men  
His hands were gentle, his hands were strong  
Victor stood in the stadium  
His voice was brave and strong  
And he sang for his fellow prisoners  
Till the guards cut short his song  
His hands were gentle, his hands were strong  
They broke the bones in both his hands  
They beat him on the head  
They tore him with electric shocks  
And then they shot him dead  
His hands were gentle, his hands were strong

Being blown out of the sky  
Leaves you bitter with the feeling  
That they didn't have to die

A long and lonely road  
Because nobody seemed to care back then  
When a soldier made it home

And the stars are on their way  
As I stare into the evening  
Looking for the words to say  
That I saw the lonely soldier  
Just a boy that's far from home  
And I saw that I was just like him  
While upon this earth I roam  
And there may not be any big parades  
If I ever make it back  
As I come home under cover  
Through a world that can't keep track  
Of the heroes who have fallen  
Let alone the ones who won't  
Which is why nobody seems to care  
When a soldier makes it home

Once upon a time there was a little boy who  
Played the ukelele. He'd go around town,  
'Blmp, blmp, blmp, blmp, blmp, blmp, blmp,  
BImp blmp blmp, blmp blmp, blmp!'  
Grown-ups said ""Get that thing out of here!""  
  
Not only that, the boy's father was a gettin'  
In trouble. He was a magician. He had a  
Magic wand. He could go 'Zoop! Zoop!' make  
Things disappear. But the father played too  
Many tricks on people. Somebody doing a  
Hard job of work, 'zzt, zzt, zzt', up comes the  
Father with his magic wand, 'Zoop!' no saw.  
Come to someone about to drink a nice cold  
Glass of something, 'Zoop!' the glass  
Disappears, He'd come to someone about  
To sit down after a hard day's work, 'Zoopl'  
No chair.  
  
People said to the father, ""You get out  
Of here, too. Take your magic wand and  
Your son!"" The boy and his father were  
Ostracized. That means they made them  
Live on the edge of town.  
  
Now in this town they used to tell stories.  
The old people used to tell stories about  
The giants that lived in the old days They  
Used to tell a story about a giant called  
Abiyoyo. They said he was as tall as a  
House and could eat, people, up.  
Of course, nobody believed it, but they  
Told the story anyway.  
  
One day, one day, the sun rose, blood red  
Over the hill. And the first people got up  
And looked out of their window, they saw a  
Great big shadow in front of the sun. And  
They could feel the whole ground shake.  
'Stomp, stomp'. Women screamed, 'Ahh!'  
Strong men fainted ""Ohh!"" - ""Run for  
Your lives! Abiyoyo's coming!""  
  
He came to the sheep pasture, grabs a  
Whole sheep, 'Yeowp!' Comes to the cow  
Pasture, grabs a whole cow, 'Yeowp!'  
Daniel, ""Grab your most precious  
Possessions and run! Run!"" Just then the  
Boy and his father woke up ""Hey, Paw,  
What's coming over the field?"" - Oh, Son,  
That's Abiyoyo. Oh, if I could only get him  
To lie down, I could make him disappear.""  
  
The boy said ""Come with me, Father."" He  
Grabs his father by one hand. The father  
Gets the magic wand, the boy gets the  
Ukelele. They run across the field. People  
Yelled, ""Don't go near him! He'll eat you  
Alive!"" There was Abiyoyo. He had long  
Fingernails cause he never cut 'em.  
Slobbery teeth, cause he didn't brush  
Them. Stinking feet, 'cause he didn't wash  
'em. He raised up with his claws, the boy  
Whips out his ukelele and starts to sing.  
  
Well, you know the giant had never heard a song  
About himself before, and a foolish grin spread  
Over the giant's face. And the giant started to  
Dance ""Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo,"" the boy  
Went faster, ""Abiyoyo, yoyoyo, yoyoyo. Abiyoyo,  
Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo,"" The giant  
Got out of breath. He staggered. He fell down flat  
On the ground 'Zoop!, Zoop!' people looked out  
The window, Abiyoyo disappeared.  
  
They ran across the fields. They lifted the boy  
And his father up on their shoulders. They said,  
""Come back to town. Bring your damn ukelele,  
We don t care anymore!"" And they all sang:  
  
Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo

A nice pretty house we'll build and fix

Build our house of bricks and blocks

"There's a tavern up on the roadside, I must be coming into town  
The moon must be in Aries, because the truck ain't slowing down  
Pulled back on the throttle, I've been doing that all day  
Looking ahead for a right-hand turn to carry me away  
There's times for understanding, it don't seem like one of those  
The times are too demanding when you're hanging by your nose  
So why don't you just get out of here and leave me here to pray?  
That one of these mornings the sun's going to rise and carry me away  
Carry me over the highway  
Carry me over the sky  
Carry me over the loneliness  
That I'm feeling here tonight  
You know I'm feeling just like a riptide and I'm feeling a little scared  
A twisted maze of old highways, nobody has repaired  
It ain't nothing that can't be handled like an actor in a play  
Who becomes enraged, jumps from the stage and gets a little carried away  
Now all of your highways, don't mean much to me no more  
I've been on all of your highway roads of that you can be sure  
But I still get lost on all of them roads, I can't seems to find my way  
I know there's one out there somewhere to carry me away  
Carry me over the highway  
Carry me over the sky  
Carry me over the loneliness

"Warm me from the wind and take my haand  
A song is sounding, softly singing  
My song is cast upon the rainbow waves  
Forever splashing in the sunlight  
Prove to me there's a love still left  
In all of this emptiness around me  
Take me from the chilling of the evening  
  
Though you know my love that I must go  
A-following the winds that blow inside me  
I've nowhere left to run or hide  
Except if you will come and run beside me  
And even if you do there'll be a lot for us to do  
To keep believing  
Take me from the chilling of the evening  
  
And now my time has come down many streets  
I'm coming from a night decaying  
The song that itself sings is all alone  
I cannot even hear it playing  
Now to leave before I understand  
Just what it is I'm leaving  
Take me from the chilling of the evening

Seasons spinning 'round again  
Years keep rolling by  
  
Seems like I've been here before  
Can't remember when

All my roads have bends  
No clear cut beginnings  
So far no dead ends

Each one gets but what he needs  
The experience of living every day

"Words and music by Arlo Guthrie  
If all the doors were closed in heaven  
Where would all the angels go  
Would they just fly around forever  
Or would they come down here below  
If the pearly gates were closed this morning  
Would there be angels here tonight  
And would they live their lives among us  
And share the darkness with their light  
If all the doors were close in heaven  
They'd have to close the road to hell  
We'd all be stuck here with each other  
There would be nowhere else to dwell  
If the pearly gates were closed this morning  
And everyone there had to leave  
And death was nothing but a moment  
Beyond the breaths you took to breathe  
If all the doors were closed in heaven  
Who would dare abuse a child  
Or let a little kid go hungry  
Or not return a simple smile  
If the pearly gates were closed this morning  
And the host of heaven was on the street  
I wonder if they'd look much different  
From the likes of you and me  
So I hope they close the doors to heaven  
And all the angels up above  
Come and build a home among us  
Remind us what it is to love  
If the pearly gates were closed this morning  
Would there be angels here tonight  
And would they live their lives among us  
And share the darkness with their light

Sitting down watchin' trucks roll by  
Sitting down under the light of day now  
You know that I won't tell you no lies  
  
I've been here for an hour or so  
And nothing much is going down  
I don't care much anyway  
Because you know I've been around  
  
Here on the edge of the green fields growing  
And the sunlight warming all around  
And the blowing of the early mist in the morning  
You know that I don't hear a sound  
  
Till once in a while, when a truck rolls by,  
Carrying a overload  
I don't wanna go nowhere right now  
I feel like my future sold  
  
Stand on the good land children  
You know that it won't do you in  
I must have been here one time before  
But I wonder where the hell I've been  
  
Early in the morning when the sun comes up  
And I'm walkin' all around the field  
Thinkin' to myself about the city life scenes  
And man you know they ain't for real  
  
All you got to do is stick your foot in your mouth  
And tell it where you want to go  
End up talkin' to yourself some time  
Alone along a country road  
  
Stand on the good land children  
I feel like I'm bound to stay  
And do the same this morning  
Like I went and did yesterday  
  
Stand on the good land children  
You know that it won't do you in

You got what it takes, and I know it make it through

But in the end if it's love you're givin'  
Don't be afraid, don't give it up  
Give it all you got  
There's people around who are standin' right by your side  
Walkin' hand in hand, they could follow you up to the sky  
But if you leave 'em alone, they'll be on their own  
And then there'll be reason to try,  
What's the use payin' dues when you got no reason why

We were hardly up and walking before money started talking  
And it's sad that failure is an awful crime  
Well it's been that way for a millennium or two  
But now it seems that there's a different point of view  
If you're a corporate titanic and your failure is gigantic  
Down to congress there's a safety net for you

"Like the tree that grows so tall  
Leaves turn gold and then they fall  
They've gone down, now they've grown  
They're going home  
  
Mountain streams may run and flow  
Clean the sands on which they go  
Stretching down like it had known  
It's going home  
  
Sunrise early in the dawn  
Slips away, then it's gone  
Leaves the night to carry on  
While it's going home  
  
Once a man he lived and died  
What he said death could not hide  
Even though it's often tried  
But he was going home  
  
Now my friends it's time to go  
And this love will live to grow  
And I want you all to know  
I'm going home

I am a little Beggar and a Beggar I have been  
For three score'are more in this little Isle of green  
And I'm known from the Liffy down to Segue  
And I'm known by the name of bold Donahue  
  
Of all the trades a-goin' now sure beggin is the best  
When a man gets tired he can lay him down to rest  
He can beg for his dinner when there's nothing left to do  
Then just cut around the corner with his old Rigadoo  
  
I slept in a barn way down in Curabawn  
A-waitin' in for the mornin' I slept till the dawn  
With the holes in the roof and the rain a-comin' through  
And the cats and the rats they were playin' peeka-boo  
  
Who should awaken but the woman of the house  
With here white spotted apron and her calico blouse  
She began to frighten when I said boo!  
Sayin' don't be afraid ma'am it's old Johnny Dhu.  
  
I met a little flaxy haired girl one day,  
Good morning little flaxy haired girl I say  
Good morning little Beggar Man and how do you do  
With your rags and your tags and your old Rigaioo  
  
Buy a pair of leggings and a collar and a be  
And a nice big lady I will fetch by and by  
Buy a pair of goggles and I'll color them blue  
And an old fashioned lady I will make her too  
  
Over the fields with the pack on my back  
Over the field with my great heavy sack  
With the holes in my shoes and the toes a'peekin' through  
Singin' skittilee rink-a-doodle it's the old Johnny Dhu  
  
Must be going to bed boys, it's gettin' late at night

"Words and music by Arlo Guthrie  
  
Beneath this balcony of stars  
Beyond the searchlight stage where we've become  
The stuff of time amid the waves  
Whose nets are cast along the shore when day is done  
  
As the seabird flies aboce  
My songs are sung to those I've come to love  
The petals strung into the leis  
The flowering of days I've just begun  
  
A second chance to grasp a dance  
Beneath the last rays setting of the sun  
Tears along the trail of sand  
Footprints in the water lead me back to who I am  
  
When gods and goddesses decreed  
The mountains raised up from beneath the seas  
The sound of sovereign thrones  
Above the hand tied bureaucrat who moans  
  
This crazy love amazes me  
As I just gaze into your eyes  
The liquid sun is split upon the sea  
I want to be where I can see the moon arise  
  
A second chance to grasp a dance  
Before the moment fades to summarize  
Tears along the trail of sand  
Footprints in the water lead me back to who I am  
  
Along the lonely stretch of sand  
Reduced to just a woman and a man  
Bathed in the lunar light  
The likes of which I might just understand  
  
Among the myths I know are real  
The goddess disguised as herself revealed  
I sang her song out loud  
She sat herself beside me in the crowd  
  
A second chance to grasp a dance  
Into the moment that she would allow  
Tears along the trail of sand  
Footprints in the water lead me back to who I am

How long it took love to grow

We two together are so right  
You make the darkness so bright

And we've got over our crying  
And we've come out of this fine  
Because when two loves grow old  
There can be no denying  
That their love may soon grow colder  
Yet that's when we started trying  
Oh babe, this love we have must be for real  
We've overcome, now it's sealed

For handing out authority to men who were insane  
You say its all fixed up now, you've got new guys on the line  
But you had better remember this while you still got the time  
Mothers still are weeping for their boys that went to war  
Father still are asking what the whole damn thing was for  
And People still are hungry and people still are poor  
And on this week of work these days don't feed the kids no more  
Schools are still like prison  
'Cause we don't learn how to live  
And everybody wants to take, nobody wants to give

And if I live a long life, all the stories I could tell  
A mans who falls in poverty of sickness and of grief  
Hell yes

"When I was younger she'd come to me in dreams  
Her face was hidden in the mountain streams  
Her voice disguised as the sound of the wind  
The rustling of leaves, she would call from within  
Wake up, wake up, wake up, she said  
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up dead  
So many memories of those years have passed  
Beyond the confusion, that thought would last forever  
The countless veils that I wore like clothes  
Have been stripped away, now stand here exposed  
Wake up, wake up, wake up, she said  
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up dead  
In the night when the moon casts no shadows at all  
We sat by the fire as she started to call  
Out to all who would hear that the death of what's dead  
Is the birth of what's living and her words filled my head  
Wake up, wake up, wake up, she said  
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up dead  
It's the life that lies sleeping when you think you're awake  
Forever is real and the rest is just fake  
And though volumes are written on this subject alone  
She used three simple words and she brought it all home  
Wake up, wake up, wake up, she said  
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up dead

Tired of running around all morning  
From his animal interviews  
He awoke with a hand on his brow  
Askign who are you  
They spent the rest of their lives together  
Making their debuts  
Dressed in leaves and wearing blues  
Some say one thing, some say two  
Ain't much about it anyone can do  
Keep on walking till my soles wear through  
Wearing away my shoes  
Evening comes and the sky turns red  
Clouds of colors cover up our heads

What are you going to tell your groom  
How's he going to feel on the day of your wedding  
What will your friends assume  
Oh, but Joseph and Mary were married

Won't be long till I am home again with you  
Just a few more miles to go  
Won't be long till I can get back on my own  
Won't be long till I can spend my time with you  
  
In the airport I'm standing in a line  
Search my pockets, check me out and I'm alright  
It's not hard but it ain't easy all the time  
To be in some other town most every night

Oh, I miss the singing from porch banjo nights  
And when friends come by to pass the time away  
And when the winds that chill the Bershires in the night  
Heading east through Massachusetts toward the bay

"I've been keeping on the run  
I've been traveling with the sun  
I've been singing all my life and getting by  
Got to keep up with what's going on  
In this place I've been so long  
And I guess I'll just keep singing all my life  
And it's so good to come home  
To a woman all alone  
Forgetting how sad loneliness can be  
She will take me from this world  
Then she'll gently take the world away from me  
I'll be coming home at night  
While the kids are sleeping tight  
She'll be lit by firelight and looking fine  
And the kids jump out of bed  
Hello Daddy, what did you get  
Did you think of anything on down the line  
She'll be talking with her smile  
Saying, honey, wait awhile  
The kids have missed you, soon they'll be asleep  
She will take me from this world  
Then she'll gently take the world away from me  
Oh the prophets and the sages  
And the wise men through the ages  
All that's written down on pages from above  
Just can't adequately describe  
What I'm feeling here inside  
It's just useless to be living without love  
And I'll take her by her hand  
Just a woman and a man  
Without trying to understand what we should be  
She will take me from this world  
Then she'll gently take the world away from me

"Lyrics by Glen Anthony  
Music by Charlie Chaplin  
My love, you are the song  
That sings inside of me  
The song is always the same  
It starts with love and ends with your name  
The more that I love you  
There's more in you to love  
And yet I just don't know how  
I could love you more than I do right now  
They say that love grows old  
But our love turned to gold  
You kissed my sorrows away  
You touched my heart  
What more can I say  
Each day my life is new  
For God blessed me with you  
And when my life is all through  
Without a word you always knew  
That all my life my life was you  
  

"
"(Julie Miller)  
  
When I go don't cry for me  
In my fathers arms I'll be  
The wounds this world left on my soul  
Will all be healed and I'll be whole  
  
Sun and moon will be replaced  
With the light of Jesus' face  
And I will not be ashamed  
For my savior knows my name  
  
It don't matter where you bury me  
I'll be home and I'll be free  
It don't matter where I lay  
All my tears be washed away  
  
Gold and silver blind the eye  
Temporary riches lie  
Come and eat from heaven's store  
Come and drink and thirst no more  
  
So weep not for me my friend  
When my time below does end  
For my life belongs to him  
Who will raise the dead again  
  
It don't matter where you bury me  
I'll be home and I'll be free  
It don't matter where I lay  
All my tears be washed away

"We met in the springtime when blossoms unfold  
The pastures were green and the meadows were gold  
Our love was in flower as summer grew on  
He love like the leaves now has withered and gone.  
The roses have faded, there's frost at my door  
The birds in the morning don't sing anymore  
The grass in the valley is starting to die  
And out in the darkness the whippoorwills cry.  
Alone and forsaken by fate and by man  
Oh, Lord, if You hear me please hold to my hand  
Oh, please understand.  
Oh, where has he gone to, oh, where can he be  
He may have forsaken some other like me  
He promised to honor, to love and obey  
Each vow was a plaything that he threw away.  
The darkness is falling, the sky has turned gray  
A hound in the distance is starting to ""BAY""  
I wonder, I wonder what he's thinking of  
Forsaken, forgotten without any love.  
Alone and forsaken by fate and by man  
Oh, Lord, if You hear me please hold to my hand  
Alone and forsaken by fate and by man  
Oh, Lord, if You hear me please hold to my hand  
Oh, please understand.

Well I work the double shift  
In a bookstore on St. Clair  
While he pushed the burning ingots  
In Dofasco stinking air  
Where the truth bites and stings  
I remember just what we were  
As the noon bell rings for  
Blackhawk and the white winged dove  
Hold on to your aching heart  
I'll wipe the liquor from your lips  
A small town hero never dies  
He fades a bit and then he slips  
Down into the blast furnace  
In the heat of the open hearth  
And at the punch clock he remembers  
Blackhawk and the white winged dove  
I remember your leather boots  
Pointing up into the sky  
We fell down to our knees  
Over there where the grass grew high  
Love hunters in the night  
Our faces turned into the wind  
Blackhawk where are you know  
Blackhawk and the white winged dove  
We were Blackhawk where are you know  
We were Blackhawk where are you know  
Do you still have the ring I gave you  
On the banks of Lake Bear  
Where I felt certain that I knew you  
My cool and distant debonair  
Now we drink at Liberty Station  
Another cup of muscatel  
Wrapped in the strong arms of the Union  
Raisin' kids from raisin' hell

How bright is it shining in your world  
Some morning when you wake up all alone  
Just come on home to your blue Kentucky girl  
Don't wait to bring great riches home to me  
I need no diamond rings or fancy pearls  
Just bring yourself, you're all I'll ever need

I know that you'll come back again  
As soon as you get blue  
And I know what will happen then  
One kiss and I'll give one to you

You tear the soul from me  
But I want to live so I'll forgive  
Everytime you leave

There where no cuckoos, no sycamores  
We played about the forest floor  
Underneath the silver maples, the balsams and the sky  
We popped the heads off dandelions  
Assuming roles from nursery rhymes  
Rested on the riverbank  
And grew up by and by, and grew up by and by  
  
Frail my heart apart  
And play me a little shady grove  
Ring the bells of rhymney  
Till they ring inside my head forever  
Bounce the bow, rock the gallows  
For the hangman's reel  
And wake the devil from his dream

I'm going back to Harlan  
I'm going back to Harlan

"Hey pretty baby are you ready for me  
It's your good rockin' daddy down from Tennessee  
Well I'm just outta Austin bound for San Antone  
With the radio blastin' and the bird dog on  
There's a speed trap up ahead South of town  
But no local yokel's gonna shut me down  
Cause me and the boys got this rig unwound  
And we've come a thousand miles from the guitar town  
  
Nothin' ever happened round my home town  
And I ain't the kind to just hang around  
But I heard someone callin' my name one day  
And I followed that voice down the lost highway  
Everybody told me you can't get far  
Now I'm smokin' into Texas with the hammer down  
And a rockin' little combo from the guitar town  
  
Hey pretty baby don't you know it ain't my fault  
Love to hear the steel belts hummin' on the asphalt  
Wake up in the middle of the night in a truck stop  
Stumble in the restaurant, wonderin' why I don't stop  
Well I gotta keep rockin' while I still can  
Got a two-pack habit and a motel tan  
When my boots hit the boards it's a brand new hand  
Put my back to the risers and make my stand  
Hey pretty baby won't you hold me tight  
I'm loadin' up and rollin' out of here tonight  
One of these days I'm gonna settle down  
And I'll take you back with me to the guitar town

"[Chorus: ]  
How she could sing the Wildwood Flower  
The orphan girl he would love so long  
In the end he knew she'd been his finest hour  
And all he has left of her is a song  
  
He first saw her  
Standing by a cabin door  
Her song was ringing  
Out in a voice so strong and sure  
To the lonesome valley  
He bring her there to be his bride  
Where they would live and work together  
Side by side  
  
She was his sunshine  
She was his moon and morning star  
His words would ring to  
The chords of her guitar  
  
He was driven  
And lost to her for days and days  
'Til the lonesome valley  
Finally drove her far away  
  
[Chorus: ]  
  
We all cling to  
As the years keep rolling on  
One single promise  
Of a love that's past and gone  
And that lonesome valley  
We all walk it by ourselves  
With the wildwood flower  
Is a story we will tell  
  
[Chorus: ]  
  
How she could sing the Wildwood Flower  
And all we have left of her is a song

To make it on our own  
  
As a lonely girl in a lonely world  
And though my life has been so blessed  
I have no one to hold my hand  
And feel once more a sweet caress  
  
I've had my share of lovers  
And cared for many others  
I always thought there'd be  
Another one to come along  
But if love can't find me again  
I'll put it all behind me then  
I'll just go and learn to sing  
Another sad love song

She never dreamed her life would be like this  
To have no one to hold her hand

That big loud whistle, as it blew and blew  
Said hello to the southland, We're comin' to you  
And we're movin' on, oh, hear my song  
You had the laugh on me, so I set you free  
And I'm movin' on  
  
Mister fireman, won't you please listen to me  
'Cause I got a pretty mama in Tennessee  
Keep movin' me on, keep rollin' on  
So shovel the coal, let this rattler roll  
And keep movin' me on  
  
Mister Engineer, take that throttle in hand  
This rattler's the fastest in the southern land  
To keep movin' me on, keep rollin' on  
You gonna ease my mind, put me there on time  
And keep rollin' on  
  
I've told you baby, from time to time  
But you just wouldn't listen or pay me no mind  
Now I'm movin' on, I'm rollin' on  
You've broken your vow, and it's all over now  
So I'm movin' on  
  
You've switched your engine, now I ain't got time  
For a triflin' woman on my main line  
Cause I'm movin on, you done your daddy wrong  
I warned you twice, now you can settle the price  
'Cause I'm movin on  
  
But someday baby, when you've had your play  
You're gonna want your daddy, but your daddy will say  
Keep movin' on, you stayed away too long  
I'm through with you, too bad you're blue  
Keep movin' on

"He said ""Oh my love. Oh my Antonia  
You with the dark eyes and palest of skin  
Tonight I am going from Santa Maria  
Wait for me till I'm in your arms once again""  
  
She held me, she kissed me, begged me not to leave her  
To cross on 1he mountain my fortune to win  
But a letter now tells me she died of a fever  
I'll never see her in this world again  
  
You are my sorrow, you are my splendor  
You are my shelter through storm and through strife  
You are the one I will always remember  
All off the days of my life  
  
I curse the ambition that took me far from her  
For a treasure not ever so fine or so fair  
As the flash of her smile or the touch of her fingers  
The fire in her heart and the smell of her hair  
  
She left me a note that cried ""Do not weep for me  
Behold you are with me as sure as the stars  
That rise in the evening to shine down upon me  
Behold I am with you wherever you are""  
  
I can still hear him. he calls to me only  
What once was begotten shall come to no end  
But the road is so long and the nights are so lonely  
My soul just to hold him in this world again  
  
You are my sorrow, you are my splendor  
You are my shelter through storm and through strife  
You are the one I will always remember  
All of the days of my life  
  
Oh my love, Oh my Antonia  
You with the dark eyes and palest of skin  
How could I know that night in Santa Maria  
I'd never see you in this world again

Oh have you seen my dear companion  
For he was all this world to me  
I hear he's gone to some far country  
And that he cares no more for me  
I wish I were a swallow flying  
I'd fly to a high and lonesome place  
I'd join the wild birds in their crying  
Thinking of you and your sweet face  
Oh have you seen my dear companion  
For he was all this world to me  
But now the stars have turned against me  
And he cares no more for me  
Oh when the dark is on the mountain  
And all the world has gone to sleep  
I will go down to the cold dark waters  
And there I'll lay me down and weep  
Oh have you seen my dear companion  
Oh have you seen my dear companion  
Oh have you seen my dear companion  
For he was all this world to me

"(Bruce Springsteen)  
Last night I dreamed that I was a child  
Out where the pines grow wild and tall  
I was trying to make it home through the forest  
Before the darkness falls  
I heard the wind rustling through the trees  
And ghostly voices rose from the fields  
I ran with my heart pounding down that broken path  
With the devil snappin' at my heels  
I broke through the trees, and there in the night  
My father's house stood shining hard and bright  
The branches and brambles tore my clothes and scratched my arms  
But I ran till I fell, shaking in his arms  
I awoke and I imagined the hard things that pulled us apart  
Will never again, sir, tear us from each other's hearts  
I got dressed, and to that house I did ride  
From out on the road, I could see its windows shining in light  
I walked up the steps and stood on the porch  
A woman I didn't recognize came and spoke to me through a chained door  
I told her my story, and who I'd come for  
She said ""I'm sorry, son, but no one by that name lives here anymore""  
My father's house shines hard and bright  
It stands like a beacon calling me in the night  
Calling and calling, so cold and alone  
Shining 'cross this dark highway where our sins lie unatoned

"I was born a black boy  
My name is Emmett Till  
I walked this earth for fourteen years  
Then one night I was killed  
For speaking to a woman  
Whose skin was as white as dough  
That's a sin in Mississippi  
But how was I to know  
  
I'd come down from Chicago  
To visit with my kin  
Up there I was a cheeky kid  
I guess I always been  
But the harm they put upon me  
Was too hard for what I done  
For I was just a black boy  
I never hurt no one  
  
They took me from my uncle's house  
Mose Wright was his name  
He'd later stand and without hesitation  
Point the blame  
At the ones who beat and cut me  
And shot me with a gun  
Then threw me in the river  
Like I was trash when they were done  
  
I was sent back to my mother  
At least what was left of me  
She kept my casket open  
For the whole wide world to see  
The awful desecration  
And the evidence of hate  
You could not recognize me  
The mutilation was so great  
  
There came a cry for justice then  
To be finally fulfilled  
All because of me, a black boy  
My name is Emmett Till  
  
But I'd have rather lived  
'Til I was too old to die young  
Not miss all I left behind  
All that might have come  
The summer clouds above my head  
The grass beneath my feet  
The warmth of a good woman  
Her kisses soft and sweet  
  
Perhaps to be a father  
With a black boy of my own  
And watch him grow into  
A kinder world than I had known  
  
Where no child would be murdered  
For the color of his skin  
And love would be the only thing  
Inside the hearts of men  
  
They say the horror of that night  
Is still haunting heaven still  
Where I am one more black boy  
My name is Emmett Till

She'd prefer the blue  
How I crave the liquor of her song

What harm could she do  
She shall be my prisoner her life long  
My songbird wants her freedom  
Now don't you think I know  
  
But I can't find it in myself  
To let my songbird go  
I just can't let her go  
  
O lord, when your jeweler's eye  
Peers into my soul  
O lord, I am overcome with shame  
Take me lord and purify  
Heal me with a word  
Lord, I beg a gift I dare not claim

Went down to the station  
To meet my baby at the gate

Anything stronger than the ties that bind.

But when you love someone,  
Life is not long enough.

It was your blessing and your curse

Bread and roses we shall bring

When nobody's even keepin' score

Your stumble into grace  
Still with every turn the world  
Becomes a sadder place  
It swallows up the ones  
You have loved the most  
So you sleep with none  
You wake with ghosts

Teasin' my memory teaching me how to lay low  
When I don't want to  
Well love is elusive this I know now  
It's making me crazy leaving me out  
In the open when I don't want to  
The moments of pleasures Never do last  
Are gone like a suitcase full of your past  
Long gone and in a hurry  
Baby, I can't go through this again  
I don't need to go down more then I've already been  
Just like a wild fire you're running all over town  
As much as you burn me baby I should be ashes by now  
The second street beggars alone in their life  
Drunk on a sidewalk to hide from the night  
Like I am They're just like I am  
Baby, I can't go through this again  
I don't need to go down more then I've already been

"Her mama picked him up in south Minnesota  
He promised her the world but they never got that far  
For he was last seen in that '59 DeSota  
When Sally was born in the black hills of Dakota  
She was washed in the blood of the dying Sioux nation  
Raised with a proud but a wandering heart  
And she knew that her roots were in the old reservation  
But she had stars in her eyes and graeter expectations  
No rings on her fingers no bells on het toes  
With bugs on her headlights  
And runs in her hose  
Through the valley of the shadow of Roosevelt's nose  
Adios, South Dakota, adios Sally Rose  
They've got a national monument carved out of stone  
On the side of a mountain where her forefathers roamed  
Playing cowboys and Indians right under the nose  
Of Theodore Roosevelt and the sweet Sally Rose  
So she left Rapid City in the blue moonlight hour  
With her eye on the highway and her foot on the floor  
And turnin' the dial she was pulled by the power  
Of the word coming out of that broadcasting tower

"
"(Leonard Cohen)  
  
Say a prayer for the cowgirl her horse ran away  
She'll walk 'til she finds him her darlin' her stray  
But the river's in flood and the roads are awash  
And the bridges break up in the panic of loss  
  
And there's nothin' to follow nowhere to go  
He's gone like the summer gone like the snow  
And the crickets are breaking her heart with their song  
As the day caves in and the night is all wrong  
  
Did she dream was it he who went galloping past  
And bent down the fern broke open the grass  
And printed the mud with the well-hammered shoe  
That she nailed to his speed in the dreams of her youth  
  
And although he goes grazin' a minute away  
She tracks him all night she tracks him all day  
And she's blind to his presence except to compare  
Her injury here with his punishment there  
  
Then at home on a branch on a highest tree  
A songbird sings out so suddenly  
And the sun is warm and the soft winds ride  
On a willow tree by the riverside  
  
Ah the world is sweet and world is wide  
He's there where the light and the darkness divide  
And the steam's comin' off him he's huge and he's shy  
And he steps on the moon when he paws at the sky  
  
And he comes to her hand but he's not really tame  
He longs to be lost she longs for the same  
And he'll bolt and he'll plunge thru the first open pass  
To roll and to feed in the sweet mountain grass  
  
Or he'll make a break for the high plateau  
Where there's nothing above and nothing below  
It's time for their burden the whip and the spur  
Will she ride with him or will he ride with her  
  
So she binds herself to her galloping steed  
And he binds himself to the woman in need  
And there is no space just left and right  
And there is no time but there is day and night  
  
Then she leans on his neck and whispers low  
Whither thou goest I will go  
And they turn as one and they head for the plain  
No need for the whip or no need for the rein  
  
Now the clasp of this union who fastens it tight  
Who snaps it asunder the very next night  
Some say it's him some say it's her  
Some say love's like smoke beyond all repair  
  
So my darlin' my darlin' just let him go by  
That old silhouette on the great western sky  
And I'll pick out a tune and they'll move right along  
And they're gone like smoke and they're gone like this song  
  
Say a prayer for the cowgirl

"Was in the merry month of May  
When all gay flowers were a bloomin',  
Sweet William on his death-bed lay  
For the love of Barbara Allen.  
  
He sent his servant to the town  
To the place where she was dwelling  
Said, ""You must come to my master's house,  
If your name be Barbara Allen.""  
  
So slowly, slowly she gets up,  
And to his bedside going  
She drew the curtains to one side  
And says, ""Young man, you're dying.""  
  
""I know, I'm sick and very low,  
And sorrow dwells within me  
No better, no better I never will be.  
Til I have Barbara Allen.""  
  
""Don't you remember last Saturday night  
When I was at the tavern,  
You gave your drinks to the ladies there  
But you slighted Barbara Allen?""  
  
He reached up his pale white hands  
Intending for to touch her  
She turned away from his bedside  
And says, ""Young man I won't have you.""  
  
He turned his cheek into the wall  
And bursted out a crying  
""What I do to thee I do to all  
And I do to Barbara Allen.""  
  
She had not walked and reached the town  
She heard the death bells ringing  
And as they rolled they seemed to say,  
""Hard-hearted Barbara Allen.""  
  
""Oh Mother, oh mother go make my bed  
Make it both long and narrow  
Sweet William died for me today  
I'll die for him tomorrow.""  
Sweet William was buried in the old church yard  
  
And Barbara there anigh him,  
And out of his grave grew a red, red rose,  
And out of hers, a briar.  
They grew and grew to the old churchyard,  
  
Where they couldn't grow no higher,  
And there they tied in a true love's knot.  
The rose wrapped around the briar.

It was a teenage wedding  
And the old folks wished them well  
You could see that Pierre  
Did truly love the mademoiselle  
And now the young monsieur and madam  
Have rung the chapel bell  
""C'est la vie"", say the old folks  
It goes to slow you never can tell  
They furnished off an apartment  
With a two room roebuck sale  
The coolerator was crammed  
With T. V. dinners and ginger ale  
But when pierre found work  
The little money comin' worked out well  
""c'est la vie"", say the old folks  
It goes to show you never can tell  
  
They had a hi-fi phono  
Boy did they let it blast  
Seven hundred little records  
All rockin' rhythm and jazz  
But when the sun went down  
The rapid tempo of the music fell  
""c'est la vie"", say the old folks  
It goes to show you never can tell  
  
They bought a souped-up jitney  
'Twas a cherry-red '53

To celebrate their anniversary  
It was there that Pierre  
Was wedded to the lovely mademoiselle

"Cheatin' is a thing that starts when you bring  
Two lonely people face to face with a brand new kiss  
She blames him and he blames her  
Neither one is really quite sure which way it is  
And all of the time in the back of their minds  
They know they're gonna have to lie about where they've been  
Cheatin' is a thing that takes a little ring  
And breaks into pieces that'll never go together again  
Cheatin' is a part of lovin' that starts  
When true love isn't what lovers are lookin' for  
A stranger here, a stranger there  
You turn around and swear that you'll never go back for more  
And lyin' at night when you're holdin' him tight  
Somethin' that a cheater's heart is bound to learn  
Cheatin' is the thing that's guaranteed to bring  
Two unhappy people to the point of no return  
And the worst of cheatin' is the sad little kids  
Hangin' in the middle while mummy and daddy they choose  
Cheatin' is a game where nobody wins  
And the ones that aren't big enough to play are the ones who lose

Back through the years I go wondering once again  
Back to the seasons of my youth  
I recall a box of rags that someone gave us  
And how my mamma put these rags to use  
  
There were rags of many colours, and every piece was small  
And I didn't have a coat and it was way down in the fall  
Mamma sewed the rags together, sewing ever piece with love  
She made my coat of many colours, that I was so proud of  
  
As she sewed she told the story from the bible she had read  
About a coat of many colours, Joseph wore and they she said  
Perhaps this coat will bring you, much love and happiness  
And I just couldn't wait to wear it, and mamma blessed it with a kiss  
  
My coat of many colours that mamma made for me  
Made only rags, but I wore it so proudly  
Although we had no money. oh I was rich as I could be  
In my coat of many colours, my mamma made for me  
  
So with patches on my breaches and holes in both my shoes  
In my coat of many colours, I hurried off to school  
Just to find the others laughing and makin' fun of me  
In my coat of many colours, my mamma made for me  
  
Oh, I couldn't understand it, for I felt I was rich  
And I told them of the love my mamma sewed in ever stitch  
And I told them all the story, mamma told me while she sewed  
And how my coat of many colours is worth more than all of their clothes  
  
They didn't under stand it and I tried to make them see  
That one is only poor only if they choose to be  
Now I know we have no money, but I'm as rich as I could be  
In my coat of many colours, my mamma made for me  
In my coat of many colours, my mamma just made for me

Like criminals, they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer  
The sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way  
To ease the pain of idleness and the memory of decay  
I gaze into the doorway of temptation's angry flame  
And every time I pass that way, I always hear my name  
Then onward in my journey, I come to understand  
That every hair is numbered like every grain of sand  
I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night  
In the violence of a summer's dream, in the chill of a wintry light  
In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space  
In the broken mirror of innocence on each forgotten face

Sometimes I turn, there's someone there, other times it's only me

He worked the rice fields with their cold dark wells  
He worked the oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico  
The only thing we've owned is this old house here by the road  
  
And when he dies he says he'll catch some blackbird's wing  
And we will fly away to heaven

She walked through springtime when I was home  
The days were sweet, our nights were warm  
The seasons changed, the jobs would come  
The flowers fade, and this old house felt so alone  
When the work took me away  
  
And when she dies she says she'll catch some blackbird's wing

Went driving through the night  
Miles and miles without a word

They'd build such a deadly Denver bend

Another young man safely strummed  
His silver string guitar

But he was just a country boy  
His simple songs confess  
And the music he had in him  
So very few possess

I could tell you black was white I could tell you day was night  
Not only that I could tell you why  
Back then I could really tel a lie  
  
Well I'd hire a kid to say he was lame  
Then I'd touch him and make him walk again  
Then I'd pull some magic trick I'd pretend to heal the sick  
I was takin' everything they had to give  
It wasn't all that bad a way to live  
  
Well I'm in this desert town and it's hot as hell  
But no one's buyin' what I got to sell  
I make my lame kid walk I make a dumb guy talk  
I'm preachin' up a storm both night and day  
But everyone just turns and walks away  
  
Well I can see that I'm only wasting time  
So I head across the road to drink some wine  
This old man comes up to me He says I seen you on the street  
You're pretty good if I do say myself  
But the guy that come thru here last month he was somethin' else  
  
Instead of callin' out for fire from above  
He just gets real quiet and talks about love  
And I'll tell you somethin' funny He didn't want nobody's money  
Now I'm not exactly sure what this all means  
But it's the damndest thing I swear I've ever seen  
  
Well since that time every town is the same  
I can't make a dime, I don't know why I came  
I decide I'll go and find him And find out who's behind him  
He has everyone convinced that he's for real  
Well I figure we can work us out a deal  
  
So he offers me a job and I say fine  
He says I'll get paid off on down the line

But it's a mean piece of water my friend.

"You call me from a phone booth with tears in your voice

And every time is the first  
Everytime is the last time with you  
Oh it never gets no better  
And it couldn't get no wore

He says I look familiar has he made this run before  
And I tell him I don't think so  
What's it matter anyway  
Just tell me what the meter reads  
And I'll go and get your pay  
  
Well now it's down to you and me though it don't seem right  
We both know where we'll be and what we'll do tonight  
And after an hour or two  
When the night comes to an end  
My heart has found another way

Everytime is the last time with you

Let's save what's left unsaid for another time  
'Cause I know there'll be another time  
So until then

Will you roam, Johnny Sailor, would you roam along with me  
To some lonesome spot where nobody can see

She was brisk, plump and jolly and her age scare 19

Waving her pocket handkerchief and wiping her eyes

I spied on a couple so loving and supple  
While sailing along the French Shore, yeah

They're actions peculiar appeared to me then  
But now they're not funny no more  
They were hugging and kissing  
Oh what I've been missing  
While sailing along the French Shore, yeah  
While sailing along, sailing along

You see they're not young anymore  
Still yet they don't know  
How I witnessed the show that they played  
All along the French Shore, yeah  
They played along the French Shore  
  
That ends the story of my bonny days  
Would that I could live them once more

You can't believe you're broken heart will ever mend  
But every mountain has its faces that'd make you want to stop  
On this so unwelcome journey from the bottom to the top  
  
Move along  
I believe there's Something Beautiful to see  
Move along  
I believe there's Something Beautiful  
Just waiting for you and me  
  
I know you'll never count the tears you've cried  
Though you've asked a million questions  
No one could tell you why  
A single soul is chosen to be the one put to the test  
But there will be some consolation for a heart that never rests  
  
The years will make us older  
The winters make us colder  
And there's one more thing I've come to know for sure  
There's no bitterness that smolders, no chip on any shoulder  
That a random act of kindness couldn't cure  
  
[Chorus]

"Love me now while we're alive  
It's the best thing we can do  
We'll have no time upon Cloud Nine  
So Heaven on Earth will have to do  
I can sing like a bird  
And dance like a demon  
And I do it all so well  
'Cause I made a deal with the Devil  
And when I die  
I'm going Straight to Hell  
Oh Yeah  
I'm going Straight to Hell  
Standing at the Crossroads  
He offered wine women and song  
Riches, Fame and Fortune  
In my hands from that day on  
I was granted there and then  
A life of Rock and Roll  
It seemed like such a bargain  
For just one eternal soul  
I know I'll curse this damned decision  
And I'll regret it the moment I fall  
But I'll be making the most  
Of a bad situation  
Till my number is called  
Sometimes I swear I've come out on top  
In this ill conceived contract  
There's nights I say  
It's a small price to pay  
For the life and times I've had  
I think ""Here's to the Gents and Ladies  
And the foolish times we spent  
They cost me Afterlife in Paradise  
And they were worth every single cent""  
So have a dance  
With the walking damned  
Before my time is done  
A deal is a deal and I really doubt  
Fire and Brimstone will be much fun  
I have every expectation  
That my final prayers will go unheard  
And my veiled death bed confession  
Will not move the Mighty Lord  
I'm sure that I'll be sorry  
When he slams St. Peter's Gate  
But I'll dive right into damnation  
With a smile across my face

"She doesn't see the coming fall  
She doesn't show no fear at all  
Bring on autumn moon or the driving rain  
I only hope I see her face again

Everything is gonna be alright when summer comes  
The darkest stars will burn so bright when summer comes  
We will open up our bodies to the warming of the sun  
When summer comes  
  
I will wait in the silence until she returns  
To melt the frozen prison round this fool who never learns  
Every living thing that's born must have its end  
What winter takes away, spring brings back again

Summer doesn't feel the coming frost  
And she doesn't yield to pain or loss  
Death where is thy victory where is thy string  
When every year we hear the birds of summer sing

Nothing's hurting, nothing's sore

For picking the captain over you  
She wonders if you missed her

So you never miss the dawn  
No question now, you know which road you're taking  
Lights all green, the radio plays just the perfect song  
  
Well, the war's been won  
All the fights are fought  
You find yourself in just the spot  
It's a place where everybody's got a song to sing  
Just like the final movie scene  
The prince will find his perfect queen  
The hero always saves the world  
The villains get what they deserve  
The boy will always get the girl

Well of course she got strong

And sing an oleful ditty

We started from the city  
We planned a day or two at Mahers  
We stalwart men were chosen  
To remove old Charlie from Angle Pond  
Who fell in when the pond was frozen  
  
We seven men came roaring down  
On the road to Roaches Line  
We might have stopped in Avondale  
Or Brigus might have been fine  
We was hungry as sin but we never stopped in  
Nor took any time to park us  
We all of us knew that we must get through  
To remove old Charlie's carcass

Here's to Shave the Master  
No better horse ne'er ran the course  
Nor pulled the logs more faster  
Here's to Charlie Horse  
And I want ye all to know  
Charlie's gone to the big corral  
Where all good horses go  
  
In the car was Ol' Pocket Comb  
And beside him Old Moose Coosten  
And Barracuda Bill and Jimmy Clark  
In the back seat he was roostin'  
There was Smiley Stubborn and the Mounted Police  
It wasn't hard to find him  
And Johnny Pollack and Sagebrush Sam  
Was sitting right in beside him  
Kevin and Buck was also there  
But they brought some brawn and brains  
They was aiming to help as best they could  
To remove old Chuck's remains  
Charlie was like a brother to Shave  
And he loved him well of course  
Charlie was a very good man you see  
Although he'd been a horse

And just relate the end  
With two stout doors and a few strong ropes  
We removed old Shady's friend  
We gave him a decent sendoff  
With all our hats removed  
So long as we helped old Shave and his friend  
Our loyalty was proved  
Somewhere up in the great beyond  
His eyes are shining bright  
Charlie nods an approving nod  
'Cause he knows we did him right  
Shave will join him there one day  
And he'll bring the harness leather  
And so for all of eternity  
They'll pull the logs together

I fished with my father, so long long ago  
We were proud of our trade, and in us it did show  
We held our heads high, there was lots of fish then  
That was the time, when we were proud men  
We challenged great storms and sometimes we won  
Faced death and disaster, we rose with the sun  
We worked and we toiled, we strained our men brane  
We were a proud people, will we ere be again?  
Chorus  
My father is gone now, and the fish are gone too.  
Abused and mis-managed, oh what can we do?  
I'm too old to change, but what of my sons,  
How will they know that we weren't the ones?  
Dfo regulations permitted the rape  
Of our beautiful ocean, from head land to cape  
They brought in big trollers, they tore up our twine  
Politians don't care for what's yours or what's mine!  
Chorus  
You brave Newfoundlanders, now listen to me  
Shove the package to hell, go back to the sea  
If we don't stand our ground, we will fade away  
And the bones of our fathers will turn into clay  
And I spent my whole life, out there on the sea  
Some government bastard now takes it from me  
It's not just the fish, they've taken my pride  
I feel so ashamed that I just want to die.  
Back to the sea.

"As I rode ashore from my schooner close by  
A girl on the beach sir I chanced to espy  
Her hair it was red and her bonnet was blue  
Her place of abode was in Harbour LeCou  
Oh boldly I asked her to walk on the sand  
She smiled like an angel and held out her hand  
So I buttoned me guernsey and hoved way me chew  
In the dark rolling waters of Harbour LeCou  
  
My ship she lay anchored far out on the tide  
As I stroll along with that maid at my side  
I told her I loved her, I said I'll be true  
And I winked at the moon over Harbour LeCou  
As we walked on the sands at the close of the day  
I thought of my wife who was home in Torbay  
I knew that she'd kill me if she only knew  
I was courting this lassie in Harbour LeCou  
  
As we passed a log cabin that stood on the shore  
I met an old comrade I'd sailed with before  
He treated me kindly saying, Jack how are you  
It's seldom I see you in Harbour LeCou  
And as I was parting, this maiden in tow  
He broke up my party with one single blow  
He said, regards to your missus  
And your wee kiddies too  
I remember her well, she's from Harbour LeCou  
  
I looked at this damsel, a-standing 'long side  
Her jaw, it just dropped and her mouth opened wide  
And then like a she-cat upon me she flew  
And I fled from the furies of Harbour LeCou  
  
So come all you young sailors who walk on the shore  
Beware of old comrades you sailed with before  
Beware of the maidens with the bonnets of blue  
And the pretty young damsels of Harbour LeCou

"I was just seventeen, when I made the AHL  
I couldn't skate in junior, but my fists rang like a bell.  
I'll never win a title, and I'll never win the cup,  
But when it comes to ladies, I've had the best of luck.  
  
My first one was a sly one, hanging round the rink,  
But they sent me off to Cornwall, as fast as you could blink,  
In Moose Jaw I was right in love, the daughter of the coach -  
He traded me for nothing, didn't take to my approach.  
  
So good-bye, fare thee well,  
There's no time for delay,  
You'll see me at the face-off, or catch the play-by-play  
So good-bye, fare thee well,

But never trust a fellow with a helmet on his head.

Nancy couldn't watch me fight, she'd always be in tears,  
Waving from the bleachers, and screaming in my ears,

But I had a one way contract, blew the money for the ring.  
  
I should have sent a letter, and it would have been polite,

I'm calling from the station, perhaps another day,  
Cause they're calling up a rookie, and they're trading me away.

It's an awkward conversation, in a most peculiar way...

Someday? ""  
It seemed like only days ago, we had so much to say  
Did we take it all for granted?, did it all gets thrown away?

Then there was such a stuttering silence, that I felt my mouth go dry  
We'll talk about the weather, cause there's not much more to say...

There's a permanent smile on your face  
Your friends all complain that you're going insane  
But the truth is they're just afraid  
  
Hey somewhere  
You threw your fear in the sea of no cares  
Hey somewhere  
You threw your fear in the sea of no cares  
  
When you decide that what counts is inside  
Your friends all say ""It's a lie""  
But there's no brighter light than the look in her eyes  
When you're walking her home through the night  
  
Hey somewhere  
You threw your fear in the sea of no cares  
Hey somewhere  
You threw your fear in the sea of no cares  
  
Let yourself go with the tide  
There's an angel by your side  
Tonight  
  
Back at the bar getting cynically stoned  
Your friends are drinking alone  
But it's funny, they don't even cross your mind  
When she asks you into her home  
  
Hey somewhere  
You threw your fear in the sea of no cares  
Hey somewhere  
You threw your fear in the sea of no cares  
Hey somewhere  
You threw your fear in the sea of no cares  
Hey somewhere

"She left St.John's one day in May  
Dressed in her Sunday best  
A kind man sat beside her  
While she cried her way out West  
She moved in with her cousin  
Found a job down in the mall  
Her friends at home were jealous  
Said they'd see her in the fall

You know that she wants to try, never lets you see her cry  
You know that she wants to try, she's got seagulls in her eyes

New friends, they don't understand

She made some decent money  
But nothing comes for free  
The windy street, just can't compete  
With the sky, the rocks and sea

They wanted her to stay  
But she bought a panel van

Come along with me!  
Come for one night and be my wife

And he makes such fortune play

Well about a 12 months later he roved out once more  
And he went into the tavern where he'd often been before  
He wasn't in there very long when his fair maid he did see  
And she brought forth a baby three months old and placed it on his knee  
When he saw the baby, he began to curse and swear  
And he said unto that fair young maid, ""Why did you bring him here?!""

"When I was a lad in a fishing town  
Me old man said to me  
You can spend your life, your jolly life  
Just sailing on the sea  
You can search the world for pretty girls  
Til your eyes are weak and dim  
But don't go searching for a mermaid, son  
If you don't know how to swim  
  
'Cause her hair was green as seaweed  
Her skin was blue and pale  
Her face it was a work of art  
I love that girl with all my heart  
But I only like the upper part  
I did not like the tail  
  
I signed onto a sailing ship  
My very first day at sea  
I seen a mermaid in the waves  
A-reaching out to me  
Come live with me in the sea, said she  
Down on the ocean floor  
And I'll show you a million wondrous things  
You've never seen before  
  
So over I jumped and she pulled me down  
Down to her seaweed bed  
And a pillow made of a tortoise shell  
She placed beneath my head  
She fed me shrimp and caviar  
Upon a silver dish  
From her head to her waist  
It was just my taste  
But the rest of her was a fish  
  
'Cause her hair was green as seaweed  
Her skin was blue and pale  
Her face it was a work of art  
I love that girl with all my heart  
But I only like the upper part  
I did not like the tail  
  
But then one day she swam away  
So I sang to the clams and the whales  
Oh, how I miss her seaweed hair  
And the silver shine of her scales  
But then her sister, she swam by  
Set my heart awhirl  
'Cause her upper part was an ugly fish  
But her bottom part was a girl  
  
Yes her hair was green as seaweed  
Her skin was blue and pale  
Her legs they are a work of art  
I love that girl with all my heart  
And I don't give a damn about the upper part

With his underwear stuffed and his trapdoor undone.

"In cuttin' and haulin' in frost and in snow  
We're up against troubles that few people know  
It's only by courage and patience and grit  
And eatin' plain food that we keep ourselves fit  
The hard and the easy we take as they come  
And when ponds freeze over we shorten our runs  
To hurry my haulin' with spring coming on  
I near lost me a mare out on Tickle Cove Pond  
  
Lay hold William Oldford, lay hold William White  
Lay hold of the cordage and pull all your might  
Lay hold of the bowline and pull all you can  
And give me a lift with poor Kit on the pond  
  
I knew that the ice grew weaker each day  
But still took the risk and kept haulin' away  
One evening in April, bound home with a load  
My mare showed some halting against the ice road  
She knew more than I did as matters turned out  
Been lucky for me had I joined her in doubt  
She turned round her head with tears in her eyes  
As if she was sayin', you're risking our lives  
  
All this I ignored with a whip-handle blow  
For man is a stupid dumb creature you know  
And the very next moment the pond gave a sigh  
And up to our necks went poor Kitty and I  
  
Lay hold William Oldford, lay hold William White  
Lay hold of the cordage and pull all your might  
Lay hold of the bowline and pull all you can  
And give me a lift with poor Kit on the pond  
  
And if I had taken wise Kitty's advice  
I ne'er would have made that shortcut on the ice  
Poor creature she's dead, poor creature she's gone  
I'll ne'er get my mare out of Tickle Cove Pond  
  
I raised an alarm you could hear for a mile  
And neighbors showed up in a very short while  
You can always rely on the Oldfords and Whites  
To render assistance in all your bad plights  
To help a kind neighbor is part of their lives  
The same can be said for their children and wives  
And with the rope fastened around the mare's breast  
William White for a shanty song made a request  
There was no time for thinkin', no time for delay  
Straight from his heart came this song right away  
  
Lay hold William Oldford, lay hold William White  
Lay hold of the cordage and pull all your might  
Lay hold of the bowline and pull all you can  
And give me a lift with poor Kit on the pond

Lay hold of the cordage and pull all your might  
Lay hold of the bowline and pull all you can

We never say ""hello"" or ""how's it going?"", ""good day"" or any of that  
We just look at them and nod our heads and wink say 'Whadd'ya At?'  
CHORUS:  
Whadd'ya At? How's she going buddy, Whadd'ya At today?  
Whadd'ya At? How's she going buddy, Whadd'ya At today?  
But then I walked into a shopping mall and much to my surprise  
An old friend from my hometown was a sight for my sore eyes  
And of all the people I met down in the city or in the mall  
I think I like my hometown friend the best one of them all  
Because he didn't say ""hello"" or ""how's it going today?"" or any of that  
My old friend he just looked at me and smiled said ""Whadd'ya At?""  
CHORUS x 2  
Let this be a lesson to all our people who go away  
Remember if you meet someone the special words we say  
We don't ever say ""hello"" or ""how's it going?"", ""good day""  
Or any of that.  
You just look at them and nod your head now wink say ""Whadd'ya At?""

I tell you that this, this is not our fate, no no no  
Now, let us all not talk falsely now

While the women, the women, they came and then they went  
Oh, and the barefoot servants too, that's me, that's you  
But outside there's a cold distance  
Listen for the wildcats, here them growl  
Two riders were approaching as the wind began to howl  
Oh, there are those among us right here, right now  
Who still see life as some kind of a joke  
All along the watchtower, said, all along this watchtower  
Those of you who still have eyes to see, ears hear me  
You will be saved by grace in the end  
Saved by time if you don't understand  
That your hatred is rooted in your fear  
And your paranoia and insecurities  
Well, they don't belong here  
You got to take someones hand  
You got to learn to make your stand  
And it's a one, two, three, four  
Look at the sky, you can open the door  
And take my hand, take my hand, take my hand  
Ah, don't you want to touch  
Don't you want to feel  
Don't you know that this is real

One thing I could give you,  
Maybe it was this

The anguished repeat  
The sweat of our sadness  
The twist of the sheets

Where will I be when you've found it?  
I pray a lot about these bad feelings inside  
But I can't pray my way through or around it

Who can say what's better when my heart's become the cost  
A mere token of a brighter jewel sent from above  
  
Fare thee well my bright star  
The vanity of youth the color of your eyes  
And maybe if I'd fanned the blazing fire of your day-to-day  
Or if I'd been older I'd been wise  
  
Too thick the heat of those long summer evenings  
For a cool evening I began to yearn  
But you could only feed upon the things which feed a fire  
Waiting to see if I would burn  
  
Fare thee well my bright star  
It was a brief brilliant miracle dive  
That which I looked up to and I clung to for dear life  
Had to burn itself up just to make itself alive  
  
And I caught you then in your moment of glory  
Your last dramatic scene against a night sky stage  
With a moment so clear that it's as if you're still before me  
My once in a lifetime star of an age  
  
So fare thee well my bright star

And this strange season of pain will come to pass  
When the healing hands of autumn cool me down

"During the time of which I speak it was hard to turn the other cheek  
To the blows of insecurity  
Feeding the cancer of my intellect the blood of love soon neglected  
Lay dying in the strength of its impurity  
Meanwhile our friends we thought were so together  
They've all gone and left each other in search of fairer weather  
And we sit here in our storm and drink a toast  
To the slim chance of love's recovery.  
There I am in younger days, star gazing,  
Painting picture perfect maps of how my life and love would be  
Not counting the unmarked paths of misdirection  
My compass, faith in love's perfection  
I missed ten million miles of read I should have seen  
Meanwhile friends we thought were so together  
Left each other one by one in search of fairer weather  
And we sit here and drink a toast  
To the slim chance of love's recovery.  
Rain soaked and voice choked like silent screaming in a dream  
I search for our absolute distinction  
Not content to blow and bend  
To the whims of culture that swoop like vultures  
Eating us away, eating us away  
Eating us away to our extinction  
Oh how I wish I were a trinity, so if I lost a part of me  
I'd still have two of the same to live  
But nobody gets a lifetime rehearsal, as specks of dust we're universal  
To let this love survive would be the greatest gift we could give  
Tell all the friends who think they're so together  
That these are ghosts and mirages, these thoughts of fairer weather  
Though it's storming out I feel safe within the arms of love's discovery

I got a bad case I can't shake off of me  
The fevered wanderin round wondering how it ought to be  
You work in the system

Eyes show the hell you're gonna give 'em  
When they back off the mic for once and give it to a woman

Brutal fantasies I catch as catch can  
I'm a psychic and a laywoman

The ticker of the nation breaking down like a bad clock  
I want the pendulum to swing again  
So that all your mighty mandate was just spitting in the wind  
It doesn't come by the bullwhip  
It's not persuaded with your hands on your hips  
It's not the company of gunslingers  
The epicenter love is the pendulum swinger  
She is she is she is  
It's fine about the old scroll Sanskrit  
Gnostic gospels the da vinci code a smash hit  
Aren't we dying just to read it and relate it  
Too hard just to go by a blind faith  
But they left out the sisters  
I've been praying to a father god so long I really missed her  
The goddess of benevolence  
You should listen to your mama if you have a lick of sense left  
Pushed under by the main press, buried under a code of dress  
Relegated by the Vatican  
But you can't keep a spirit down that wants to get up again  
If we're a drop in the bucket  
With just enough science to keep from saying fuck it  
Until the last drop of sun burns its sweet light  
Plenty revolutions left until we get this thing right

"We get to be, a ripple in the water  
We get to be a rock that's thrown  
We get to be a boy on the bridge  
Standing over the reservoir  
See the water lap along the shore line  
The buried forest of a man made lake  
Cemeteries are laying underneath it  
Your heart like a dam when it breaks.

What it costs, what it takes  
For one perfect world  
When we look the other way.  
I'm okay, if I don't look a little closer  
I am driving with the tank full  
I'm OK if I don't see beyond the shore  
The sun is blistering this black top road.  
I'm OK if I don't have to do the killing  
We are talking, cellular and mobile  
OK know what the killing is for.  
As if its some kind of cure for this world of woe

And in this moment we are denying  
What it costs, what it takes  
For one perfect world  
When we look the other way  
It's one perfect world  
When we look the other way  
Its one perfect world  
  
If you can't see beyond the myth of isolation  
And the miracle of daybreak doesn't move you anymore,  
Connect the points and see the constellations  
As the night comes down on the reservoir.  
  
We are swimming, we are floating  
And in this moment we are beholden to  
What it costs, and what it takes  
For one perfect world  
Can we learn to live another way?  
It's one perfect world  
Can we learn to live another way?  
Its one perfect world  
Can we learn to live another world?

"A love struck romeo  
Sings the streets a serenade  
Now he's laying everybody low  
He's got a love song that he made  
He finds a streetlight  
And he steps out of the shade  
And says something like  
""you and me, babe, how about it?""  
  
Juliet says ""hey, it's romeo!""  
""you nearly give me a heart attack!""  
Yeah well, he's underneath the window  
Now she's singing ""hey-la, my boyfriend's back""  
""you shouldn't come around here  
Singing up at people like that  
Ah anyway, whatcha gonna do about it?""

The dice were loaded from the start  
And I bet and you exploded into my heart  
And I forget, I forget the movie song  
When you gonna realize  
It was just that the time was wrong  
Julie  
  
We both come up on different streets  
And they both were streets of shame  
You know they're both dirty both mean  
Yes and the dreams were the same  
And I dreamed your dream for you  
And now your dream is real  
So tell me honey  
Now how can you look at me  
As if I was just another one of your deals  
  
Now you can fall for chains of silver  
And you can fall for chains of gold  
You know you fall for pretty strangers  
And the promises they hold  
Well you promised me everything  
And then you promised me thick and thin  
Now you just turn away and say  
""romeo, I think I used to have a scene with him.""  
  
Ah juliet  
When we made love you used to cry  
You said ""I love you like the stars above  
Gonna love you till I die""

I you know this song  
Now when you gonna realize  
It was just that the time was wrong

I can't do a love song not the way you song them to me

Oh no I can't do anything except be in love with you  
  
Yeah now and all I do is miss you  
And the way it used to be you know  
And all I do is keep the beat  
I keep bad, bad company  
And all I do is kiss you  
Through the bars of a rhyme  
When julie I'd do the stars with you  
Anytime

"I took off last night with my coat and my intention  
To make connections with the eyes that left me blind  
Left my love for the strength of that white, white line  
I left one more time I could have heard I love you  
One more time I could have heard I care  
One more time when I needed that emotion  
One more time I wasnt even there  
  
Through the darkness and the distance  
Lie champagne and smoky smiles  
Bounded by the sorrow having lost love to the miles  
I feel you  
Youre not a stranger to this white, white line  
I watched your eyes chose words so slowly  
Illusions to my view  
But I laugh and say its highway 75 that draws me here  
Its not me and its not you  
There was one more time when I should have said I love you  
One more time when I should have told you I care  
When we sit here in silence  
And we miss the ones we love that cant be here  
Its the love we leave behind  
  
I tried to lose this restless spirit in a mission of regrets  
But I cant survive without this war  
And your eyes reflect the visions that I cant forget  
I find balance on a darkened highway  
I find truth by the side of the road  
And someone elses tune to lift me high above the line  
That leaves me running from the cold  
Running from the cold  
Running from the cold

"In the ink of an eye I saw you bleed,  
Through the thunder I could hear you scream,  
Solid to the air I breathe,  
Open-eyed and fast asleep.  
Falling softly as the rain,  
No footsteps ringing in your ears.  
Ragged down worn to the skin  
Warrior raging, have no fear.  
  
Secure yourself to heaven.  
Hold on tight, the night has come  
Fasten up your earthly burdens,  
You have just begun.  
  
Kneeling down with broken prayers,  
Hearts and bones from days of youth,  
Restless with an angel's wing,  
I dig a grave to bury you.  
No feet to fall,  
You need no ground,  
Allowed to glide right through the sun,  
Released from circles guarded tight,  
Now we all are chosen ones.  
  
Secure yourself to heaven.  
Hold on tight, the night has come  
Fasten up your earthly burdens,

"We were sitting round a dying fire  
Somebody lit incense  
Somebody lit a cigarette

Backbreaking pickers in the patches  
Everythings burning down to ashes  
And down to the ground

Lighting and leaving  
And there's tea leaves tossing  
Heads up pennies in my pocket  
Dead star like a rocket  
The arc of my grieving

As distant as last nights dream unravels

Then days so still the beauty gives you pain  
The heatwave kills the green  
And she remains unseen  
But colors up my dreams  
With all things blooming  
  
This is not all there is  
It's not a kingdom  
It's not an angry god  
It feels like her  
It feels like no fear  
It feels like no doubt  
It feels like inside out

And I hunger for your laugh  
Do the craziest things like look around  
When I know youre nowhere near me  
Break my back on a song  
Though I know youre not there to hear  
  
Unanswered questions lying on the coffee table  
From a song I haven't finished since last summer  
Cause I never could decide how much was gin  
How much the sea  
Or other incidentals clouding what was really me  
  
Everything I am is bare feet and burning sand  
Waiting for the calm cool hand of the sea  
  
A madman of emotions waiting for the drug effect  
Of the reason and the intellect to comfort me

Quit my job and join the coastline baking in the sun

I will always be unable to express

"""American Tune"" is a Paul Simon song. The girls have been performing  
It since at least 1985. A live version of it appears on the  
(promo-only) ""Reverse 1"" CD, and another on the (commercially  
Available, but kinda hard to find) ""Ben and Jerry's Newport Folk  
Festival '90"" CD.  
Many is the time I've been mistaken  
And many times confused  
Yes, and I've often felt forsaken  
And certainly misused.  
Oh, but I'm all right, I'm all right  
I'm just weary to my bones  
Still, you don't expect to be bright and bon vivant  
So far away from home - so far away from home.  
I don't know a soul who's not been battered  
I don't have a friend who feels at ease  
I don't know a dream that's not been shattered  
Or driven to it's knees  
Oh, but it's all right, it's all right  
We've lived so well, so long  
Still, when I think of the road we're travelling on  
I wonder what's gone wrong  
I can't help it, I wonder what's gone wrong.  
And I dreamed I was dying  
Dreamed that my soul rose unexpectedly  
And looking back down at me  
Smiled reassuringly  
And I dreamed I was flying  
And high up above, my eyes could clearly see  
The Statue of Liberty sailing away to sea  
And I dreamed I was dying.  
Oh, we come on a ship they called the Mayflower  
We come on a ship that sailed the moon  
We come in the age's most uncertain hour  
And sing an American tune  
Oh, oh, but it's all right - it's all right, it's all right  
You can't be forever blessed  
Still, tomorrow's going to be another working day

The ugly face of danger  
The keepers of the keys  
Had me down on my knees  
In front of the gilded doors  
  
And in a world where every ax was poised to grind  
To find my peace I only held up what was already mine

But then they give a little day by day

That ended in silent confusion  
  
And as we sat stuck  
You could hear the trash truck  
Making its way through the neighborhood  
  
Picking up the thrown out  
Different from house to house  
We get to decide what we think is no good  
  
We're sculpted from youth  
The chipping away makes me weary  
And as for the truth  
It seems like we just pick a theory

And backs us with quiver and arrows  
  
To protect openings  
Cause when the warring begins  
How quickly the wide open narrows  
  
Into the smallness of  
Our deconstruction of love  
We thought it was changing  
But it never was  
It's just the same as it ever was

Came to my yard and dug in  
So I looked in a book  
To see what this could possibly mean  
  
Yeah cause there's fate in the breeze  
Signs in the trees  
And possible tragic events  
  
When forces collide  
With the damage strewn wide  
And holes blasted straight through the fence  
  
Oh the sky starts to crash

The rain on the roof starts to drumming

You come regular like seasons  
Shadowing my dreams  
  
And the Mississippi's mighty  
But it starts in Minnesota  
At a place that you could walk across  
With five steps down  
And I guess that's how you started  
Like a pinprick to my heart  
But at this point you rush right through me  
And I start to drown  
  
And there's not enough room  
In this world for my pain  
Signals cross and love gets lost  
And time passed makes it plain  
Of all my demon spirits

Of your fire willingly  
And dance the edge of sanity

Pierce my spirit

Oh I'm forever under lock and key  
As you pass through me

I would launch a thousand ships  
To bring your heart back to my island  
As the sand beneath me slips  
As I burn up in your presence  
And I know now how it feels  
To be weakened like Achilles  
With you always at my heels  
  
This bitter pill I swallow  
Is the silence that I keep  
It poisons me I can't swim free

Though I'm baptized by your touch  
I am no worse than most

"I went all the way to Paris to forget your face  
Captured in stained glass, young lives long since passed  
Statues of lovers every place  
I went all across the continent to relieve this restless love  
I walked through the ruins, icons of glory  
Smashed by the bombs from above  
  
So we must love while these moments are still called today  
Take part in the pain of this passion play  
Stretched our youth as we must, until we are ashes to dust  
Until time makes history of us.  
  
Jeu de Paume's full of faces knowing peace, knowing strife  
Leisure and toil, still it's canvas and oil  
There's just no medium for life  
In the midst of the rubble I felt a sense of rebirth  
In a dusty cathedral the living God called  
And I prayed for my life here in earth  
  
So we must love while these moments are still called today  
Take part in the pain of this passion play  
Stretched our youth as we must, until we are ashes to dust  
Until time makes history of us.  
  
There are mountains in Switzerland, brilliant cold as they stand  
From my hotel room, watching the half-moon  
Bleeding its light like a lamb  
And the town is illuminated, its tiny figures are fast asleep  
And it dawns on me the time is upon me  
To return to the flock I must keep.  
  
So we must love while these moments are still called today  
Take part in the pain of this passion play  
Stretched our youth as we must, until we are ashes to dust  
Until time makes history of us.

Each to her rendition  
Painted ourselves in a corner  
Lost for ideas blindly fishing  
For a compliment or kindness  
Just to bring us into view  
But you could not interpret me and I could not interpret you  
I remember that cold morning when the trees were black with birds  
I tried to make out some connection  
We were at a loss for words  
After all that we've been through  
I could not see giving up  
Despite the picture of our coffee growing colder in the cups  
I want to say that underneath it all you are my friend  
And the way that I fell for you I'll never fall that way again  
I still believe despite our differences that what we have's enough  
And I believe in you and I believe in love  
So we went rolling on down through the years  
Taking time off we could steal  
Until the thief of things unreconciled  
Stuck it's stick into the wheel  
Now we're tumbling in a freefall  
No one's gonna go unscathed  
But it's not because you held back and its not how I behaved  
I want to say that underneath it all you are my friend  
And the way that I fell for you I'll never fall that way again  
I still believe despite our differences that what we have's enough  
I believe in you and I believe in love  
There are avenues and supplements and books stacked on the shelf  
Labyrinths of recovery in search of our best self  
But most of what will happen now is way out of our hands  
So just let it go and see where it lands

Years later I think  
That I would have been much more alive  
To have taken you up on your offer and taken that drive  
Oh well everything that?s come before us leads us to where we are now  
And that's simple, I know so why can't I let go of the feeling  
That I'm lost somehow  
I'm just a ghost looking in  
Out of my own life just visiting  
In search of a body to have and to hold and to keep and to sleep.  
I wanna lay my head down on you  
Because you're the only solid thing in this room  
A room full of missed chance, slow dance, cold fate heartache  
I showed up for a party and saw my life story full view  
And I wanna lay my head down on you.

Will he lie beneath the clay  
Will his spirit float away

"Did you ever hear the story of the Christmas tree?  
Who just didn't want to change the show  
He liked living in the woods and playing with squirrels  
He liked bicycles and snow  
He liked wolves and eagles and grizzly bears  
And critters and creatures that crawled  
Why bugs were some of his very best friends  
Spiders and ants and all  
Now that's not to say that he ever looked down  
On a vision of twinkled lights  
Or on mirrored bubbles and peppermint canes  
And a thousand other delights  
And he often had dreams of tiny reindeer  
And a jolly old man in a sleigh  
Full of toys and presents and wonderful things  
And a story of Christmas day  
Oh, Alfie believed in Christmas alright  
He was full of Christmas cheer  
All of each and every day  
And all throughout the year  
To Him it was more than a special time  
Much more than a special day  
It was more than a beautiful story  
It was a special kind of way  
You see some folks have never heard a jingle bell ring  
And they've never heard of Santa Claus  
They've never heard the story of the Son Of God  
And that made Alfie pause  
Did that mean that they'd never know of peace on earth  
Or the brotherhood of man  
Or know how to love, or know how to give  
If they can't, no one can  
You see, life is a very special kind of thing  
Not just for a chosen few  
But for each and every living, breathing thing  
Not just me and you  
So when you're at Christmas prayers this year  
Alfie asked me if I'd ask you  
Say a prayer for the wind and the water and the wood  
And those who live there too

So I can be there when I die  
When I'm gone

In moments when you're happy

On cold and cloudy days

But little Lord Jesus, no crying he makes.  
I love thee Lord Jesus, look down from the sky.  
And stay by my side 'till morning is nigh.  
  
Be near me Lord Jesus, I ask thee to stay.  
Close by me forever and love me, I pray.

If you're lost out on the highway, do not deny the dove

There lived a maiden, Darcy Farrow was her name  
The daughter of old Dundee and a fair one was she  
The sweetest flower that bloomed o'er the range  
  
Her voice was as sweet as the sugar candy  
Her touch was as soft as a bed of goose down  
Her eyes shone bright like the pretty lights  
That shone in the night out of Yerrington town  
  
She was courted by Young Vandamere  
A fine lad was he as I am to hear  
He gave her silver rings and lacy things  
And she promised to wed before the snows came that year  
  
But her pony did stumble and she did fall  
Her dyin' touched the hearts of us one and all  
Young Vandy in his pain put a bullet through his brain  
And we buried them together as the snows began to fall  
  
They sing of Darcy Farrow where the Truckee runs through  
They sing of her beauty in Virginia City too  
At dusky sundown to her name they drink a round  
And to young Vandy whose love was true

Hey old pal  
It's great to be here with you  
The thing I'd like to give you  
Is a real good time  
Hey old pal  
I really can't believe it  
But now that you can see it  
It looks just fine  
  
What a chance to play and sing  
And have some fun  
The day should never end  
This will be a Rocky Mountain holiday  
With you and me  
And all we can see  
And all of our friends  
  
Hey old pal  
We must be daydreamin'  
At least the things we're seein'  
Are a dream come true  
Hey there gang  
It's great to be together  
It just keeps gettin' better  
I can promise you  
  
This is going to be  
The very best of times  
And we will make it so  
No more hustle and bustle  
And no more telephone lines  
And now that we're here  
Let's grab all our gear  
And off we go

"Hey there, Mr. Lonely Heart, if you could find the time  
I would like to sit and talk, to see if we could find  
The answer to the mystery of love's most precious seed  
Is it in a touch or in a kiss or simply in the need  
  
Or is it really love itself that always wants to give  
The heart and soul of all of us and everything that lives  
  
Hey there, Mr. Cold, Cold Heart, I know I could be wrong  
To think that life could be so sweet and love could be so strong  
As to gather everyone of us, like one big family  
To share with one another all we have and all we see  
  
It's true the deepest part of us is everywhere the same  
And that the only differences are really just the names  
  
We can join the children's song and show them that we care  
Let them know we're on their side, no matter when or where  
We can free their hearts from fear and hunger reconcile  
We can give a child a chance and give a child a smile  
  
True love is still the answer, and we are still the way  
The gift is in the giving, and in living what we say  
  
And if you have a lonely heart, this song is just for you  
To ask for all that you can give and all that you can do  
Remember that the mystery of love's most precious seed  
  
Is in the heart of all of us, true love is all we need  
It's in the heart of all of us, true love is all we need  
Within the heart of all of us, true love is all we need  
  
Within the heart of all of us, true love is all we need  
Within the heart of all of us, true love is all we need  
Within the heart of all of us, true love is all we need  
Within the heart of all of us, true love is all we need

"If your driving down the road and you come across an old man  
Holding out his thumb in the wind  
His clothes are old and dirty and dirty that doesn't matter  
It's his eyes that tell where he's been  
If you're not afraid to take your chances on a stranger  
He might have some company to lend  
Why don't you pull off to the side and let that old man have a ride  
He can tell you all the crazy things he's seen  
  
I'm an old hitchhiker  
The highway is the only home I know  
Where you're headed I don't mind  
I ain't been there in some time  
And it's just exactly where I want to go  
  
I can tell you how I started in the circus as a barker  
Drawing people in from far and wide  
They never did regret the dollar that it cost 'em  
We always left 'em feeling good inside  
We were headed for Montana when we hired us a dancer  
Her beauty it was more than I can say  
Then one summer night she set my soul on fire  
Lord, I wish that she was here with me today  
  
I'm an old hitchhiker, I wonder what's a waiting 'round the bend  
I don't know what I might see and I don't need no guarantee  
Just a ride from here to there and back again  
  
I was only seventeen when I took the open highway  
Took it for my teacher and a friend  
I've been thirty years a-thumbing  
Some might call it bumming  
But it's better than just crying in the wind  
So if you're driving down the road and you come across an old man holding out
his thumb in the rain  
Why don't you pull off to the side let the poor boy have a ride  
He can tell you all the crazy things he's seen  
  
I'm an old hitchhiker looking to the far side of the hill  
Some people say I'll settle down  
Build a home in some small town  
But within my heart I know I never will  
  
I'm an old hitchhiker

Looking up at the Spanish window  
From a trail on the edge of the timberline  
I've been off on a journey to find myself  
Maybe find my way back home  
Been many an hour all by myself  
In the darkest of nights  
I was never ever alone  
  
Back in the San Juan Mountains again  
On a ride with some good old boys  
Telling stories around a campfire  
The sound of laughter is the loudest noise  
There's something in a night in the wilderness  
It's a magical thing to me  
Like the sky is just a little bit brighter  
And your life is everything that you'd like it to be  
  
There'll be snow on the passes tomorrow  
You can feel it in the chill of the wind  
Let the rain wash away all my sorrow  
Today is the day that my life starts all over again  
  
I guess that it's just about over now  
Everything is about to change  
Everything is a brand new number, darling  
Everything is a brand new game  
And it's funny I could even call you that  
After all the pain we've been through  
Ah, but time is the master of healing  
Love is the master of everything that we do  
  
There'll be snow on the passes tomorrow  
You can feel it in the chill of the wind  
Let the rain wash away all my sorrow  
Today is the day that my life starts all over again

"There was never a doubt, never a doubt in my mind  
We weren't meant to be lonely  
Never a doubt I knew that I'd find you some day  
There was never a doubt, after all of those nights alone  
All those desperate mornings  
Never a doubt, there was never a doubt in my mind  
  
I suppose there have been times when you felt like a room filled with darkness  
Not a window around  
There must have been moments you felt you were truly alone  
Then again each of us knows, in a night of unbearable sadness  
Still a light can be found  
In each morning the promise that someday your true love will come  
  
I suppose there are some people who never believe in the magic  
Oh the magic of love  
They think nothing is precious and life is just pleasure and pain  
Then again each of us knows, when a heart has been broken it's tragic  
Oh the magic of love  
Even that which is broken with love can be mended again  
  
All the things that you fear, at the most they mean nothing  
All the sorrow and sadness can just disappear  
  
There was never a doubt, never a doubt in my mind  
We weren't meant to be lonely  
Never a doubt I knew that I'd find you some day  
There was never a doubt, after all of those nights alone  
All those desperate mornings  
Never a doubt, there was never a doubt in my mind  
There was never a doubt in my mind  
Never a doubt in my mind

"Old Train, I can hear your whistle blow  
And I want to be jumping on again  
Old Train, I've been everywhere you go  
And I know what lies beyond each bend  
  
Old Train, each time you pass  
You're older than the last  
And it seems I'm too old for running  
I hear your rusty wheels grate against the rails  
They cry with every mile  
And I think I'll stay awhile  
  
Old Train, I grow weary at the miles  
And I miss the freedom that was mine  
Old Train, just to think about those times  
I'll smile when you're highballing by  
  
Old Train, each time you pass  
You're older than the last  
And it seems I'm too old for running

"Back in 1958 we drove an old V8 and when it'd gone a hundred thou' we got out
and pushed it a mile  
  
We didn't know who we were, we didn't know what we did  
We were just on the road  
  
Headin' down from Canada on a gravel road a mile from Montana  
Then my Daddy read a sign and took us in the wrong direction  
I asked my Daddy where are we goin', he said we'll just follow  
Our nose, so I looked out the window and dreamed I was a cowboy  
  
We didn't know who we were, we didn't know what we did  
We were just on the road  
  
I met a girl in a truck cafe, fell in love almost right away  
Then the Mercury was ready to go and I had to leave her

"Yesterday I had a dream about dying  
About laying to rest and then flying  
How the moment at hand  
Is the only thing we really own  
And I lay in my bed and I wonder  
After all has been said and is done for  
Why is it thus we are here  
And so soon we are gone  
  
Is this life just a path  
To the place that we all have come from  
Does the heart know the way  
And if not can it ever be found  
In a smile or a tear  
Or a prayer or a sigh or a song  
  
And if so I sing for my father  
And in truth you must know I would rather  
He were here by my side  
We could fly on the wings of a dream  
To a place where the spirit could find us  
And joy and surrender would bind us  
We are one anyway  
Anyway we are more than we seem  
  
There are those who will lead us  
Protect us each step of the way  
From beginning to end  
For each moment forever each day  
Such a gift has been given  
It can never be taken away  
  
Though the body in passing must leave us  
There is one who remains to receive us  
There are those in this life  
Who are friends from our heavenly home  
So I listen to the voices inside me  
For I know they are there just to guide me  
And my faith will proclaim it is so  
We are never alone  
  
From the life to the light  
From the dark of the night to the dawn  
He is so in my heart  
He is here he could never be gone  
Though the singer is silent  
There still is the truth of the song  
  
Yesterday I had a dream about dying  
About laying to rest and then flying  
How the moment at hand  
Is the only thing we really own  
  
And I lay in my bed and I wonder

"All of my memories lay in the life of the highway  
All of my nights in old motels and sleeping alone  
All of my days on the road with no one beside me  
All of my dreams of a place that I can call home

Somewhere in the shade near the sound of a sweet singin' river  
Somewhere in the sun where the mountains make love to the sky  
Somewhere to build me a faith, a farm and a family  
Somewhere to grow older, and somewhere a reason to try  
  
Cause I'm tired of big cities and so tired of big city ways  
Scratchin' off sunsets, and walkin' around in the maze  
Some sweet taxi dancer's tryin' to save me from bein' alone  
Ah, it's much worse than lonely, there is no place that I really belong  
I want to be home  
  
I'm leavin' this city life In my mind I'm flyin' away  
I'm leavin' tomorrow and all of the old yesterdays  
I'm leavin' the trash cans, the bright lights, the telephone lines  
I'm leavin' my sorrows and all of my memories behind  
To see what I find

Somewhere to grow older, somewhere to lay down and die

You were every girl in the world

"In the port of Amsterdam there's a sailor who sings  
Of the dreams that he brings from the wide open sea.  
In the port of Amsterdam there's a sailor who sleeps  
While the river bank weeps to the old willow tree.  
In the port of Amsterdam there's a sailor who dies  
Full of beer, full of cries in a drunkin' down fight.  
But in the port of Amsterdam there's a sailor who's born  
On a muggy, hot morn by the dawns early light.  
  
In the port of Amsterdam where the sailors all meet  
There's a sailor who eats only fish-heads and tails.  
He will show you his teeth that have rotted too soon.  
That can swallow the moon that can haul up the sails.  
And he asks to the cook with his arms open wide.  
Bring me more fish, put it down by my side.  
And he wants so to belch, but he's too full to try.  
So he gets up and he laughs and he zips up his fly.  
  
In the port of Amsterdam you can see sailors dance.  
Haunches bursting their pants, binding woman to paunch.  
They've forgotten the tune that their whiskey voice croaks.  
And they're aplitting the night with the roar of their jokes.  
And they turn and they dance and they laugh and they lust.  
To the rats it sounds of the accordion burst.  
Then it's out into the night with their pride in their pants.  
With a slut that they tow underneath the street lamps.  
  
In the port of Amsterdam there's a sailor who drinks.  
And he drinks and he drinks and he drinks once again.  
He drinks to the health of the whores of Amsterdam.  
Who have promised their love to a thousand other men.  
And they darken their bodies and their virtue long gone  
For a few dirty coins. And then when he can't go on  
He plants his nose in the sky And he wipes it up above  
And he splits like I cry for an unfaithful love.  
In the port of Amsterdam.  
In the port of Amsterdam.  
In the port of Amsterdam.

"Two days before the moon was round  
You felt the urge of sun's light beams  
The muffled world of dolphin sound  
Slipped down and back into your dreams  
  
For nine full months that passed before  
You learned of all of life's ancient rhymes  
Then mother sensed a farther shore  
And brought you forth into these times  
  
So taste the air of your new world  
And gently guide us to your mind  
It knows the winds and sails unfurled  
And holds to heart the dolphin kind  
  
Welcome precious earth made child  
We met you first in your father's songs  
And mother's smile and waters wild  
It's in this place you now belong  
  
I know you know of all these things  
And feel the faith of a dolphin's sigh  
For you were born on silver wings  
To taste the high blown crystal sky  
  
To sing one day to all of us  
The songs you learned in dolphin lair  
Giving hope to life as all we must  
And teach us how their grace to share

"A mansion on a hill is a lovely sight to see  
But like any other house it's only temporary  
Home is anywhere you choose to put your heart  
If there's no love inside, it will soon fall apart  
  
Ashes to ashes, dust into dust  
Buildings will crumble, bridges will rust  
Mountains will disappear, rivers will dry up  
And so it goes with everything but love  
  
You can drive around in a long limousine  
If you don't know where you're going, it don't mean a thing  
He who'd walk a mile just to hold an empty hand  
Knows what it means to be a wealthy man  
  
Ashes to ashes, dust into dust  
Palaces will crumble, bridges will rust  
Mountains will disappear, rivers will dry up  
And so it goes with everything but love

Smell of mornings faded  
  
What happened to the robins  
Song that sparkled in the sky  
Where's all the water gone  
That tumbled down the stream  
Will I ever catch another butterfly  
  
Right in your own backyard  
Wondering how airplanes could fly  
And the hours spent just playing  
With a funny rock you found  
With crystal specks as  
Blue as all the sky  
  
Now I watch my son  
He's playing with his toys  
He's happy and I  
Give him all I can  
But I can't help feeling  
Just a lime inside  
When to hear him say  
He wants to be a man

"A heritage of vision  
Was given to us all  
To smell the rose's fragrance  
To hear the songbird's call  
To watch the distant moonlight fill  
The coming of the tides  
To understand that life is more  
Than always choosing sides  
  
And some have seen what can be seen  
Of sailing ships and kings  
And some are given feet of clay  
And some are given wings  
And some must struggle just to breathe  
Some have a golden spoon  
And some will never leave the nest  
While some walk on the moon  
  
And don't you know the life that lives  
Within the silent hills  
Is just as rich and beautiful  
And just as unfulfilled  
As man with all his intellect  
His reason and his choice  
Oh, who's to say the nightingale  
Has any less a voice  
  
The silver dolphins twist and dance  
And sing to one another  
The cosmic ocean knows no bounds  
For all that lives are brothers  
The whippoorwill, the grizzly bear  
The elephant, the whale  
All children of the universe  
All weavers of the tale  
  
So palomino lie back down  
And dream yourself to sleep  
The hawk flies with the morning dove  
The lion with the sheep  
As far away as you may go  
We'll never be apart  
It's in your dreams that you will know  
The seasons of the heart

"Tall in the saddle we spend Christmas Day,  
Driving the cattle over snow covered plains.  
All of the good gifts given today,  
Ours is the sky and the wide open range.  
  
Back in the cities they have different ways,  
Football and eggnog and Christmas parades.  
I'll take my blanket, I'll take the reins,  
It's Christmas for cowboys, wide open plains.  
  
A campfire for warmth as we stop for the night,  
The stars overhead are Christmas tree lights.  
The wind sings a hymn as we bow down to pray,  
It's Christmas for cowboys and wide open plains.  
  
It's tall in the saddle we spend Christmas Day,  
Driving the cattle over snow covered plains.

"Riding on the City of New Orleans  
Illinois Central, Monday morning rail  
Fifteen cars and fifteen restless riders  
Three conductors and twenty-five sacks of mail  
All along a southbound odyssey  
The train pulls out of Kankakee  
Rolls along past houses, farms and fields  
Passin' towns that have no name  
Freight yards full of old black men  
The graveyards of the rusted automobiles  
  
Singing good morning America, how are you?  
Saying, don't you know me I'm your native son?  
I'm the train they call the City of New Orleans  
I'll be gone 500 miles when the day is done  
  
Dealing cards with the old men in the club car  
Penny a point, ain't no one keeping score  
Pass the paper bag that holds the bottle  
Feel the wheels a rumbling beneath the floor  
  
And the sons of Pullman porters  
And the sons of engineers  
Ride their fathers' magic carpet made of steel  
And mothers with their babes asleep  
Rockin' to the gentle beat  
And the rhythm of the rails is all they feel  
Singing good morning America, how are you?  
Saying don't you know me, I'm your native son?  
I'm the train they call the City of New Orleans  
I'll be gone 500 miles when the day is done  
  
Night time on the City of New Orleans  
Changing cars in Memphis, Tennessee  
Halfway home and we'll be there by morning  
Through the Mississippi darkness rolling down to the sea  
But all the towns and people seem  
To fade into a bad dream  
And the steel rails still ain't heard the news  
The conductor sings his song again  
The passengers will please refrain  
This train has got the disappearing railroad blues  
  
Singing good morning America, how are you?  
Saying don't you know me, I'm your native son?  
I'm the train they call the City of New Orleans

"Played a wedding for the money and I wish I could have told the bride and
groom  
Just what I think of marriage, what's in store after the honeymoon.  
I was rumbling through the verses about how men and women ought to live apart,  
How a promise never made could not be broken and would never break a heart.  
  
Suddenly from out of nowhere this little girl came spinning across the floor  
Her crinolines were billowing beneath the skirt of calico she wore.  
As her joy fell on the honored guests each one of them was drawn into her
dream  
And they laughed and stamped and clapped their hands and hollered at her,
dance little jean!  
  
They said:  
Dance little jean, this day is for you,  
Two people that you love stood up to say 'i do.'  
Dance little jean, the prayer that you had was answered today-  
Your momma's marrying your dad.  
  
Well this cynic's heart just melted as I figured what this get together meant  
And how it ended years of tears and sad confusions that the little girl had
spent.  
They told the band to pack it up about the time the couple cut the cake  
But we stayed and we played all night long for love and laughs and little
jeanie's sake  
  
We played:  
Dance little jean, this day is for you,  
Two people that you love stood up to say 'i do.'  
Dance little jean, the prayer that you had was answered today-

"Dearest Esmeralda, in another age  
Antiques would be modern, we would be the rage  
Silk would be in fashion, we would dress in lace  
Love would be the passion and the saving grace  
  
I slept one rainy night with you in Paris  
Made up for a thousand wasted years  
Dearest Esmeralda, you are magic  
I close my eyes and you make love appear  
  
Dancing in the shimmer of a crystal chandelier  
Shadows singing so low only we could hear  
Moving to the glimmer, shaking to the storm  
Outside it was raging, but inside it was warm  
  
We said goodnight in the candlelight and thunder  
Now I wake and find you're never there  
I'm becoming old enough to wonder  
Happy that I'm still too young to care  
  
Masterpieces crumble, empires tumble down  
Refugees and fantasies go underground  
Romance lasts forever, love don't fade away  
They may take our future, but they don't stop yesterday  
  
Cause somewhere in the cloudy skies of Paris  
we were part of some artist's design  
Dearest Esmeralda, you are magic  
In the gray around me how you shine

Life in the city can make you crazy  
For sounds of the sand and the sea  
Life in a high-rise can make you hungry  
For things that you can't even see  
  
Fly away, fly away, fly away.  
  
In this whole world there's nobody as lonely as she  
There's nowhere to go and there's nowhere  
That she'd rather be.  
  
She's looking for lovers and children playing  
She's looking for signs of the spring  
She listens for laughter and sounds of dancing  
She listens for any old things  
  
Fly away, fly away, fly away.

You think if I were always here, our love would be the same  
As it is the time we have, is worth the time alone

"When I was a little bitty boy just up off the floor  
We used to go down to grandma's house every month end or so  
We'd have chicken pie, country ham  
Homemade butter on the bread  
But the best darn thing about grandma's house  
Was the great big feather bed  
  
It was nine feet high and six feet wide  
And soft as a downy chick  
It was made from the feathers of forty 'leven geese  
Took a whole bolt of cloth for the tick  
  
It could hold eight kids and four hound dogs  
And a piggy we stole from the shed  
We didn't get much sleep but we had a lot of fun  
On grandma's feather bed  
  
After supper we'd sit around the fire, the old folks'd spit and chew  
Pa would talk about the farm and the war  
And granny'd sing a ballad or two  
And I'd sit and listen and watch the fire till the cobwebs filled my head  
Next thing I'd know I'd wake up in the morning  
In the middle of the old feather bed  
  
It was nine feet high and six feet wide  
And soft as a downy chick  
It was made from the feathers of forty 'leven geese  
Took a whole bolt of cloth for the tick  
  
It could hold eight kids and four hound dogs  
And a piggy we stole from the shed

Well, I love my ma and I love my pa, I love granny and grandpa too  
I've been fishin' with my uncles, I wrestled my cousin  
I even kissed Aunt Lou, ew!  
But if I ever had to make a choice I guess it oughta be said  
That I'd trade them all plus the gal down the road

"(Lady's Chains)  
Jessie went away last summer, a couple of months ago.  
After all our time together, it was hard to see her go.  
She called me right up when she arrived, asked me one more time to come,  
but living on an LA freeway ain't my kind of having fun.  
I think I'd rather be a cowboy, I think I'd rather ride the range.  
I think I'd rather be a cowboy than to lay me down in love and lady's chains.  
  
When we were just beginning, it was such an easy way.  
Laying back up in the mountains making love for sunny days.  
She got tired of picking daisies and cooking my meals for me,  
she can live the life she wants to, yes, it's all right with me.  
I think I'd rather be a cowboy, I think I'd rather ride the range.  
I think I'd rather be a cowboy than to lay me down in love and lady's chains.  
  
I'd rather live on the side of a mountain than wander through canyons of
concrete and steel.  
I'd rather laugh in the rain and sunshine and lay down my sundown in some
starry field.  
  
Oh, but I miss her in the morning when I awake alone.  
The absence of her laughter is a cold and empty sound.  
But her memory always makes me smile and I want you to know,  
I love her, yes I love her just enough to let her go.  
I think I'd rather be a cowboy, I think I'd rather ride the range.  
I think I'd rather be a cowboy than to lay me down in love and lady's chains.

"Way down in Louisiana close to New Orleans  
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens  
There stood a log cabin mad of earth and wood  
Where lived a country boy name of Johnny B. Goode  
He never ever learned to read or write so well  
But he could play a guitar just like a-ringing a bell  
  
[Chorus]  
Go, go, go Johnny go  
Go, go Johnny go  
Go, go Johnny go  
Go, go Johnny go  
Go Johnny B. Goode  
  
He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack  
Go sit beneath the tree by the railroad track  
The engineers would see him sitting in the shade  
Strumming to the rhythm that the drivers made  
People passing by would they would stop and say  
Oh my but that little country boy can play  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well his mama told him some day you will be a man  
You will be the leader of a big old band  
Many people coming from miles around  
Just to hear you play your music till the sun go down  
Maybe some day your name will be in lights  
Saying Johnny B. Goode tonight

"Oh, at first it was just like heaven in your heart and in your arms  
And paradise discovered in the sweetness of your charms  
Yes, and every day a miracle to awake and be with you  
And every night in your embrace another dream come true  
Oh, but castles sometimes crumble, some rivers still run dry  
And fairy tales are witches tales when the truth becomes a lie  
And a pocket full of promises won't buy a diamond ring  
And every word you said to me just didn't mean a thing  
It's over now, you've gone too far I can't take anymore  
Be careful now, don't hurt yourself when you walk through the door  
I can hardly stand to look at you it makes me want to cry  
Get your tongue out of my mouth because I'm kissing you goodbye  
Oh, I suppose I'll never know why things turned out this way  
And why the one you love the most is the one you drove away?  
Yes, and I suppose I'll never, ever really understand  
How I could think that you'd make me a happy married man  
So now I sit and contemplate the reason for it all  
The climb to heights of ecstasy, the failure and the fall  
If a broken heart is purposeful it's in the lesson learned  
But no matter what the reason is it hurts when you get burned  
Now I don't care, I don't think I'll ever love again  
Kemosabe used to mean ""a good and trusted friend""  
But now it stands for therapy and all the tears I cry  
Get your tongue out of my mouth because I'm kissing you goodbye  
Bye, bye goodbye  
Get your tongue out of my mouth because I'm kissing you goodbye

Now there's a banker who says I must give up my land  
There are four generations of blood in this topsoil  
Four generations of love on this farm  
Before I give up I would gladly give up my right arm

Take it away from the hands of the poor  
Tell me, what are we making weapons for

He was so like my father, he was so much like me  
To be a good comrade was the best that he dreamed he could be  
He gave up his future to revolution  
His life to a battle that just can't be won  
For this is not living, to live at the point of a gun  
I remember the nine hundred days of Leningrad  
The sound of the dying, the cut of the cold  
I remember the moments I prayed I would never grow old

What does it take for a people to learn

"My old man had a rounder's soul.  
He'd hear an old freight train.  
Then he'd have to go.  
Said he'd been blessed with a gipsy bone.  
  
That's the reason they guessed  
He'd been cursed to roam.  
Came into town back before the war.  
  
Didn't even know what it was  
He was looking for.  
He carried a tattered bag for his violin.  
  
It was full of lots of songs  
Of places that he'd been.  
He talked real ea-sy had a smiling way  
  
To pass along to you  
When his fiddle played.  
Making people drop their cares and woes.  
  
To hum out loud those tunes  
That his fiddle howed.  
Till the people there began to join that sound.  
  
And everyone in town was laughing.  
Singing, dancing round.  
Like the fiddler's tune was all they heard that night.  
  
As if some dream said  
""All the world is right""  
His fiddler's eye caught one beauty there.  
  
She had that rollin' flowin'  
golden kind of hair.  
He played for her as if she danced alone.  
  
He played his favorite songs.  
Ones he called his own.  
He played until she was the last to go.  
  
He stopped and packed his case  
And said he'd take her home.  
  
All the nights that passed a child was born.  
All the years that passed.  
That love would keep them warm.  
All their lives they'd share a dream come true.  
  
All because she danced  
while his fiddle tuned.  
My old man had a rounder's soul.  
  
He'd hear an old freight train.  
Then he'd have to go.  
All that I recall said when I was so young.  
  
No one else could really  
Sing those songs he sung.

Lady, you've been dreaming, I'm as close as I can be  
And I swear to you our time has just begun  
  
Close your eyes and rest your weary mind  
I promise I will stay right here beside you  
Today our lives were joined, became entwined  
I wish that you could know how much I love you

"A frosty Christmas Eve, when the stars where shining,  
I traveled for the home, where westward falls the hill.  
And for many, many a village, in the darkness of the valley,  
distant music reached me, peels of bells were ringing.  
  
Then spread my thoughts to olden times, to that first of Christmases  
when shepherds who were watching, heard music in the fields.  
And they sat there and they marveled, and they knew they could not tell  
whether it were angels, or the bright stars a singing.  
  
But to me heard a far, it was starry music,  
the singing of the angels, the comfort of our Lord.  
Words of old that come a traveling, by the riches of the times,  
and I softly listened, as I stood upon the hill.  
And I softly listened, as I stood upon the hill.

They talk so slowly when they do  
They are rich they are poor  
Their illusions are gone  
They share one heart for two  
  
Their homes all smell of time  
Of old photographs  
And an old fashioned song  
Though you may live in town  
You live so far away  
When you've lived too long  
  
Have they laughed too much  
Do their dry voices crack  
Talking of things gone by  
Have they cried too much

To cloud the eye  
  
They tremble as they watch the old silver clock

Tick tock oh so slow

It says I wait for you

Or else they stay in bed

In the morning chill

They will hold each others hands  
Like children in the dark

And some say letting go  
And some say love is everything

Told me the time by the clock  
I saw him last night, down by the graveyard  
Holding on to a rock  
  
I said, ""I saw you yesterday  
I saw you, Father Time""  
I said, ""Go away, go away, go away, go away, go away  
I know you're Father Time, run it down now""  
  
I said, ""Every minute, every second, every day of my life  
I meet you in the mirror  
Every time, look at each wrinkle  
I know I've got a sheriff coming""  
  
Sure I saw you, sure as time  
Sure as clock, sure is fine  
I know that mother's no father  
'Cause they call him Father Time

With woodbine and ivy his bed for to make

Lamenting and crying

Yesterday I met a girl  
She made marilyn monroe look like. .. Me  
All she had to do was walk in the room  
And my problems were starting  
Then she'd at me and she'd smile  
And I feel feel such a pain in my heart  
Wanting her to come and whisper to me  
""you're the man of my dreams""  
  
Beautiful world, beautiful world  
Sending me dreams, touching my hair  
Making me cry. .. So I feel alive  
Beautiful world, why do I hide?  
  
I dunno why  
I should spend so much time feeling so bad  
I got everything a sinner could hope to get  
This side of eden  
Maybe some day I'll wake up  
And I'll do what I should  
Write a song to make heaven and earth  
Go waltzing in time

"While walking out, one evening  
Not knowing where to go  
Just to pass the time away  
Before we held our show  
I heard a little mission band  
Playing with all their might

And left the show that night  
The day will soon be over

"Jesus, the missing years  
  
It was raining. It was cold  
West Bethlehem was no place for a twelve year old  
So he packed his bags and he headed out  
To find out what the world's about  
He went to France. He went to Spain  
He found love. He found pain.  
He found stores so he started to shop  
But he had no money so he got in trouble with a cop  
Kids in trouble with the cops  
From Israel didn't have no home  
So he cut his hair and moved to Rome  
It was there he met his Irish bride  
And they rented a flat on the lower east side of Rome...  
Italy that is  
Music publishers, book binders, Bible belters, Money Changers,  
Spoon Benders and lots of pretty Italian chicks.  
  
[Chorus]  
Charley bought some popcorn  
Billy bought a car  
Someone almost bought the farm  
But they didn't go that far  
Things shut down at midnight  
At least around here they do  
Cause we all reside down the block  
Inside at, 23 Skidoo.  
  
Wine was flowing so were beers  
So Jesus found his missing years  
So He went to a dance and said ""This don't move me""  
He hiked up his pants and he went to a movie  
On his thirteenth birthday he saw ""Rebel without a Cause""  
He went straight on home and invented Santa Claus  
Who gave him a gift and he responded in kind  
He gave the gift of love and went out of his mind  
You see him and the wife wasn't getting along  
So he took out his guitar and he wrote a song  
Called ""The Dove of Love Fell Off the Perch""  
But he couldn't get divorced in the Catholic Church  
At least not back then anyhow  
Jesus was a good guy he didn't need this shit  
So he took a pill with a bag of peanuts and  
A Coca-Cola and he swallowed it.  
He discovered the Beatles  
And he recorded with the Stones  
Once He even opened up a three-way package  
In Southern California for old George Jones  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The years went by like sweet little days  
With babies crying pork chops and beaujolais  
When he woke up he was seventeen  
The world was angry. The world was mean.  
Why the man down the street and the kid on the stoop  
All agreed that life stank. All the world smelled like poop  
Baby poop that is ..the worst kind  
So he grew his hair long and thew away his comb  
And headed back to Jerusalem to find Mom, Dad and home  
But when he got there the cupboard was bare  
Except for an old black man with a fishing rod  
He said ""Whatcha gonna be when you grow up?""  
Jesus said ""God""  
Oh my God, what have I gotten myself into?  
I'm a human corkscrew and all my wine is blood  
They're gonna kill me Mama. They don't like me Bud.  
So Jesus went to Heaven and he went there awful quick  
All them people killed him and he wasn't even sick  
So come and gather around me my contemporary peers  
And I'll tell you all the story of  
Jesus, the missing years

"Pretty paper  
Pretty ribbons of blue.  
  
Man oh man,  
I just love Christmas it's just so darn neat.  
I kinda wish every day was Christmas,  
Except Christmas eve and the Fourth of July.  
We wouldn't want to miss out on the fireworks, would we?  
When I was a kid, we used to get the Christmas catalog from Montgomery Wards
in Chicago.  
Sometimes we'd get it as early as late August.  
It was the big book of wishes, hopes and desires.  
My three brothers and I were allotted twenty-five bucks a piece, including
tax.  
  
So I'd make up a different Christmas list every night  
From the first of September 'til the twenty-forth of December.  
Matter of fact, let me present you with my Christmas credentials.  
When I was three years old, at least that's what my mother told me,  
I ate an entire ornament. I ate a big red one, I thought it was an apple.  
They kinda freaked out and was gonna take me to the hospital  
But they couldn't stop me from laughing so they just left me alone.  
So I guess I still got that Christmas in me all the time, you know?  
  
One year, I got a wooden Roly-Poly for Christmas,  
You know the things you knock down and they bounce right back up.  
They made 'em out of wood back then, that's how old I am.  
Nowadays, they make 'em out of plastic.  
My mom says, ""They just don't make 'em like that anymore.""  
And I says, ""No ma, they don't"".  
  
Then there was the year I came home only eave from the army,  
From Germany to marry my high school sweetheart on the day after Christmas.  
My little brother Billy, who was twelve at the time,  
Had just gotten his first job so he was able to afford to buy some Christmas
presents  
For his brothers and his mom and dad out of his own pocket.  
Billy had a job selling subscriptions for the Chicago Tribune.  
He told me this guy named Rocky would pick him up in a station wagon,  
Him and some other boys, and he'd take 'em out to some strange neighborhood  
And drop 'em off and he gave them this whole spiel to give their potential
customers.  
Supposedly their little brother had won a free trip to our nation's capital
Washington, D.C.,  
But he couldn't go on the trip if his older brother wouldn't accompany him  
So if you would please buy a subscription to the Chicago Tribune  
Then my little brother will be happy.  
Wow, what a shyster! Some people'll do anything to get to the Whitehouse.  
  
Then there was the year that my mom and dad gave me my first guitar.  
Ah man it was gorgeous, I still got the thing.  
It was a like aqua blue.  
Kinda dark aqua blue with a cream colored heart.  
Was a Silvertone from Montgomery Wards.  
The model was called Kentucky Blue  
And man when I saw that sitting under the tree I just couldn't wait.  
First year so I didn't know how to play it,  
I'd just stand in front of the mirror with a string  
Around my neck with that guitar and I'd try to look like Elvis.  
Then my brother Dave taught me a couple of chords,  
Now I'm here in your living room singing and talking to you.  
It's funny how things work out.  
  
So-a whyn't you go find a stranger and extend your hand to 'em.  
If you see somebody looks like  
They ain't doin' quite as well as you, slip 'em a buck,  
'specially if they don't ask for spare change.  
Go buy your honey a cuckoo clock or a musical snow shaking water ball,  
That when you wind it up it plays,  
""I want you, I need you, I love ya with all my heart.""  
'cause after all, hell man, it's Christmas.  
  
Away in a manger no crib for a bed.  
The little Lord Jesus lay down his sweet head.  
The stars in the sky look down where he lay.  
The little Lord Jesus asleep on the (1-2) hay.  
  
Merry Christmas Everybody.

"Dear penthouse,  
I never did believe anything I ever read in your magazine until just the other
night.  
  
When something happen to me that was so strange that I felt compelled to share
it with your readers.  
  
I'm a student at state-you.  
  
Maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. It was one year ago tonight that my room
mate ""stupendous dork"" and I were sittin' around the dorm poppin' a few
frosty's and burning some rope, and boning up for the speech therapy midterm
exam the next day, by reading back issues of your magazine out loud to each
other.  
  
I looked at ""stu"" and he looked at me and we both knew neither of us was going
to get a real good grade on that exam anyway. We hopped out of the dorm and
went across the street to herbie's tumble inn.  
  
Right across from the dorm there, we came through the swinging doors and I
couldn't believe my eyes, there they were, sitting at the bar, these two
luscious babes, and they were siamese twins  
  
I looked at ""stu"" and he looked at me and we looked at them and they looked at
us and then one of the twins said ""won't you join us? "" and I just laughed and
we went and sat down at the bar.  
  
Turns out, one if the ladies was a speech therapy major and her sister said
she had some rope in her purse there, and a big light bulb went off in my head
and I said ""what the heck, why don't we all go back to the dorm? ""  
  
Came out of the swingin' doors at herbie's and couldn't get across the street.  
  
There was these 30 bikers with jackets that said ""harley aristocrats"" on the
back. There was an aerobic dance class and there was the commanding officer of
the campus rotc pushing a nautilus machine right down the double yellow line.
I said ""what the heck, why don't we all go back to the dorm? ""  
  
The last thing I remember is one of the twins screaming, ""hey general put your
big heat seeking missile in my love silo!""  
  
I got my degree in spite of failing speech therapy that quarter. Last night
for the first time in a year, my room mate stupendous dork went back to
herbie's to toast our commencement. Came thru the swingin' doors and there
they were at the bar, the same two siamese twins and I said ""oh no"" and I went
and sat down a table.  
  
The twins came over to the table and the one that was a speech therapy major
looked my right in the eye and said: ""excuse me you probably don't remember
us.""

Something, somewhere, somehow took my linda by the hand  
And secretly decoded our sacred wedding band  
For when the moon shines down up on our happy, humble home  
Her inner space gets tortured by some outer space unknown.  
Repeat chorus:  
Now I ain't seen no saucers 'cept the ones upon the shelf

For if there's life out there somewhere beyond this life on earth  
Then linda must have gone out there and got her money's worth.

I yielded to the man to the right of me  
And he yielded it right back to mine  
Well, the yield went around and around and around

Just then the man in the light blue sedan  
Hit pamela's passenger side.

Pamela hit her head on the mirror  
Mrs walker got a bump on the knee  
The man hit himself in the face and said  
""why does this happen to me? ""

Saying ""hey! who hit who anyway? ""  
And the police arrived at a quarter to five

Just as long as she is near  
My woman.

"Billy, the bum lived by the thumb  
And sang of the hobo's delight  
He'd prove he could run  
Twice as fast as the sun  
By losing his shadow at night  
Now he loved every girl  
In this curly headed world  
But no one will know it seems  
For two twisted legs and a childhood disease  
Left Billy just a bum in his dreams  
And he was just a gentle boy  
A real fluorescent light  
Cried pennies on Sunday morning  
Laughs nickels on Saturday night  
And your bullets, they can't harm him  
Nor your knives tear him apart  
Humiliation killed him  
God bless his little heart  
Now he lived all alone in a run down home  
Near the side of the old railroad track  
Where the trains used to run  
Carryin' freight by the ton  
Blow the whistle as Billy'd wave back  
But the children around Billy's home town  
Seemed to have nothin' better to do  
Then run around his house  
With their tongues from their mouth  
Make fun of that crippled old fool  
And he was just a gentle boy  
A real fluorescent light  
Cried pennies on Sunday morning  
Laughs nickels on Saturday night  
And your bullets, they can't harm him  
Nor your knives tear him apart  
Humiliation killed him  
God bless his little heart  
Now some folks they wait and some folks they pray  
For Jesus to rise up again  
But none of these folks in their holy cloaks  
Ever took Billy on as a friend  
For pity's a crime  
And it ain't worth a dime  
To a person who's really in need  
Just treat 'em the same  
As you would your own name  
Next time that your heart starts to bleed  
And he was just a gentle boy  
A real fluorescent light  
Cried pennies on Sunday morning  
Laughs nickels on Saturday night  
And your bullets, they can't harm him  
Nor your knives tear him apart

Just give me one extra season

"My heart's in the ice house come hill or come valley  
Like a long ago sunday when I walked through the alley  
On a cold winter's morning to a church house  
Just to shovel some snow.  
  
I heard sirens on the train track howl naked gettin' nuder,  
An altar boy's been hit by a local commuter  
Just from walking with his back turned  
To the train that was coming so slow.  
  
You can gaze out the window get mad and get madder,  
Throw your hands in the air, say ""what does it matter? ""  
But it don't do no good to get angry,  
So help me I know  
  
For a heart stained in anger grows weak and grows bitter.  
You become your own prisoner as you watch yourself sit there  
Wrapped up in a trap of your very own  
Chain of sorrow.  
  
I been brought down to zero, pulled out and put back there.  
I sat on a park bench, kissed the girl with the black hair  
And my head shouted down to my heart  
""you better look out below!""  
Hey, it ain't such a long drop don't stammer don't stutter  
From the diamonds in the sidewalk to the dirt in the gutter  
And you carry those bruises to remind you wherever you go.

Sat the fat girl daughter of virginia and ray

Lydia  
Lydia hid her thoughts like a cat  
Behind her small eyes sunk deep in her fat.  
She read romance magazines up in her room  
And felt just like sunday on saturday afternoon.  
  
Chorus:  
But dreaming just comes natural  
Like the first breath from a baby,  
Like sunshine feeding daisies,  
Like the love hidden deep in your heart.  
  
Bunk beds, shaved heads, saturday night,  
A warehouse of strangers with sixty watt lights.  
Staring through the ceiling, just wanting to be  
Lay one of too many, a young pfc:  
  
(spoken:)  
Donald  
There were spaces between donald and whatever he said.  
Strangers had forced him to live in his head.  
He envisioned the details of romantic scenes  
After midnight in the stillness of the barracks latrine.  
  
[Repeat chorus:]  
Hot love, cold love, no love at all.  
A portrait of guilt is hung on the wall.  
Nothing is wrong, nothing is right.  
Donald and lydia made love that night.  
  
(spoken:)  
Love  
The made love in the mountains, they made love in the streams,  
They made love in the valleys, they made love in their dreams.  
But when they were finished there was nothing to say,  
'cause mostly they made love from ten miles away.

Across the sea to an island  
While the bridges brightly burn  
So far away from my land

I was walking down the road, man  
Just looking at my shoes  
When God sent me an angel  
Just to chase away my blues  
  
I saw a hundred thousand blackbirds  
Just flying through the sky  
And they seemed to form a teardrop  
From a black haired angel's eye  
  
That tear fell all around me  
And it washed my sins away  
Now everything is cool  
Everything's okay

Eat everything

And when we get through  
We'll make a big wish  
That we never have  
To do this again  
Again? again????  
  
On my very first job  
I said thank you and please  
They made me scrub a parking lot  
Down on my knees  
Then I got fired  
For being scared of bees

Fifty cents an hour.

No particular reason

Brown necktie and a matching vest  
And both his wingtip shoes  
He built a closet on our back porch  
And put a penny in a burned out fuse.

Chain smoked Camel cigarettes

"When I woke up this morning, things were lookin' bad  
Seem like total silence was the only friend I had  
Bowl of oatmeal tried to stare me down... and won  
And it was twelve o'clock before I realized  
That I was havin' no fun

But fortunately I have the key to escape reality  
And you may see me tonight with an illegal smile  
It don't cost very much, but it lasts a long while  
Won't you please tell the man I didn't kill anyone  
No I'm just tryin' to have me some fun  
  
Last time I checked my bankroll,  
It was gettin' thin  
Sometimes it seems like the bottom  
Is the only place I've been  
I Chased a rainbow down a one-way street dead end  
And all my friends turned out to be insurance salesmen

Well, I sat down in my closet with all my overalls  
Tryin' to get away  
From all the ears inside my walls  
I dreamed the police heard  
Everything I thought... what then?  
Well I went to court  
And the judge's name was Hoffman  
  
Ah but fortunately I have the key to escape reality  
And you may see me tonight with an illegal smile  
It don't cost very much, but it lasts a long while  
Won't you please tell the man I didn't kill anyone  
No I'm just tryin' to have me some fun  
Well done, hot dog bun, my sister's a nun

Wondering how a man could send a child actor  
To visit in the land of the wind chill factor.

Down in my basement  
And he waited there for me  
To have this accident  
So he could drink my wine  
And eat me like a sacrament  
And I just stood there like I do  
Then I came and went  
I came and went  
Like a bird in a foreign sky  
Couldn't even say good bye  
Or come and share the pain  
My Saddle's in the rain  
  
I saw a friend who doesn't know  
If I'm his friend just yet  
His eyes and mouth were widely open  
And his jaw was set  
Like he'd fell off a cliff  
And hadn't hit the bottom yet  
I wish he wouldn't pull those things on me  
Without a net

I had him up to the house one time  
And we was having a real good time

From the Alamo  
Sits a girl who stole my records  
Very long ago  
And she wishes, wants and washes  
Out those dirty clothes  
As she shuts her eyes and dreams  
About her one eyed Joe  
One eyed Joe  
Car parked on a dirty road  
Heaven knows the load she pulled  
Couldn't take the strain

After serving in the conflict overseas.  
And the time that he served,  
Had shattered all his nerves,  
And left a little shrapnel in his knees.

And the grass grew round his brain,  
And gave him all the confidence he lacked,  
With a purple heart and a monkey on his back.

Didn't last too long.  
He went to work when he'd spent his last dime  
And soon he took to stealing  
When he got that empty feeling  
For a hundred dollar habit without overtime.  
And the gold roared through his veins  
Like a thousand railroad trains,  
And eased his mind in the hours that he chose,  
While the kids ran around wearin' other peoples' clothes...  
  
There's a hole in daddy's arm where all the money goes,

When he popped his last balloon,  
Climbing walls while sitting in a chair.  
Well, he played his last request,  
While the room smelled just like death,  
With an overdose hovering in the air.  
But life had lost it's fun,  
There was nothing to be done,  
But trade his house that he bought on the GI bill,  
For a flag-draped casket on a local hero's hill.  
  
There's a hole in daddy's arm where all the money goes,

Well, pa told one that he told before  
And the baby got a bellyache  
Said ma to pa ""My God this car's  
Falling down a bottomless lake""  
We are falling down  
Down to the bottom of a hole in the ground  
Smoke 'em if you got 'em  
I'm so scared, I can hardly breathe  
I may never see my sweetheart again  
Well papa played the music on the radio  
Mama rocked the baby to sleep  
He said, he would've taken the other road  
But he didn't think the lake was that deep  
Well, if the ferry had been there at the end of the pier  
We'd be half way to Uncle Jake's  
Instead of looking at fish out the window, I wish  
We'd hit the bottom of the bottomless lake  
'Stead of looking at fish out the window, I wish  
We'd hit the bottom of the bottomless lake  
We are falling down  
Down to the bottom of a hole in the ground  
Smoke 'em if you got 'em  
I'm so scared, I can hardly breathe  
I may never see my sweetheart again  
So if you're ever goin' on a big trip  
You better be careful out there  
Start everything on your good foot  
Wear clean underwear  
Take along a Bible in the backseat  
Read of David and Solomon  
For if you make a mistake in the bottomless lake  
You may never see your sweetheart again  
If you should make a mistake in the bottomless lake  
You may never see your sweetheart again  
If you should make a mistake in the bottomless lake  
You may never see your sweetheart again, that's right

"I knew a girl who was almost a lady  
She had a way with all the men in her life  
Every inch of her blossomed in beauty  
And she was born on the fourth of July  
Well she lived in an aluminum house trailer  
And she worked in a juke box saloon  
And she spent all the money that I give her  
Just to see the old man in the moon  
I used to sleep at the foot of old glory  
And awake in the dawn's early light  
But much to my surprise when I opened my eyes  
I was a victim of the great compromise  
Well we'd go out on Saturday evenings  
To the drive-in on Route 41  
And it was there that I first suspected  
That she was doin' what she'd already done  
She said, ""Johnny won't you get me some popcorn""  
And she knew I had to walk pretty far  
And as soon as I passed through the moonlight  
She hopped into a foreign sports car  
I used to sleep at the foot of old glory  
And awake in the dawn's early light  
But much to my surprise when I opened my eyes  
I was a victim of the great compromise  
Well you know I could have beat up that fellow  
But it was her that had hopped into his car  
Many times I'd fought to protect her  
But this time she was goin' too far  
Now some folks they call me a coward  
'Cause I left her at the drive-in that night  
But I'd rather have names thrown at me  
Than to fight for a thing that ain't right  
I used to sleep at the foot of old glory  
And awake in the dawn's early light  
But much to my surprise when I opened my eyes  
I was a victim of the great compromise  
Now she writes all the fellows love letters  
Saying ""Greetings, come and see me real soon""  
And they go and line up in the barroom  
And spend the night in that sick woman's room  
But sometimes I get awful lonesome  
And I wish she was my girl instead  
But she won't let me live with her  
And she makes me live in my head

"There was a time  
When lonely men would wander  
Through this land  
Rolling aimlessly along  
So many times  
I've heard of their sad story  
Written in the words  
Of dead men's songs.  
Down through the years  
Many men have yearned  
For freedom  
Some found it  
Only on the open road  
So many tears of blood  
Have fell around us  
'cause you can't always do what you are told.  
Please tell me where  
Have all the hobos gone to  
I see no fire burning down  
By the rusty railroad track  
Could it be that time  
Has gone and left them  
Tied up in life's eternal traveling sack.  
Last Sunday night  
I wrote a letter  
To my loved one  
I signed my name  
And knew I'd stayed away  
Too long  
There was a time  
When my heart was free to wander

This hobo song.

Midnight fell on Franklin Street  
And the lamppost bulbs were broke  
For the life of me, I could not see  
But I heard a brand new joke  
  
Two men were standing upon a bridge  
One jumped and screamed you lose  
And just left the odd man holding  
Those late John Garfield blues  
  
An old man sleeps with his conscience at night  
Young kids sleep with their dreams  
While the mentally ill sit perfectly still  
And live through life's in-betweens  
  
I'm going away to the last resort  
In a week or two, real soon  
Where the fish don't bite but once a night  
By the cold light of the moon  
  
The horses scream the nightmares dream  
And the dead men all wear shoes  
'Cause everybody's dancin'

Everything's gone off the air

Well, I went to the bank this morning and the cashier he said to me  
""If you join the Christmas club we'll give you ten of them flags for free""  
Well, I didn't mess around a bit, I took him up on what he said  
And I stuck them stickers all over my car and one on my wife's forehead  
But your flag decal won't get you into Heaven anymore  
They're already overcrowded from your dirty little war  
Now Jesus don't like killin', no matter what the reason's for  
And your flag decal won't get you into Heaven anymore  
Well, I got my window shield so filled with flags I couldn't see  
So, I ran the car upside a curb and right into a tree  
By the time they got a doctor down I was already dead  
And I'll never understand why the man standing in the pearly gates said  
""But your flag decal won't get you into Heaven anymore  
We're already overcrowded from your dirty little war""

"I was runnin' through the summer rain, try'n' to catch that evenin' train  
And kill the old familiar pain weavin' through my tangled brain  
When I tipped my bottle back and smacked into a cop I didn't see  
That police man said, ""Mister Cool, if you ain't drunk, then you're a  
fool.""  
I said, ""If that's against the law, then tell me why I never saw  
A man locked in that jail of yours who wasn't neither black or poor as  
me?""  
Well, that was when someone turned out the lights  
And I wound up in jail to spend the night  
And dream of all the wine and lonely girls  
In this best of all possible worlds.  
Well, I woke up next mornin' feelin' like my head was gone  
And like my thick old tongue was lickin' something sick and wrong  
And I told that man I'd sell my soul for something wet and cold as that  
old cell.  
That kindly jailer grinned at me, all eaten up with sympathy  
Then poured himself another beer and came and whispered in my ear,  
""If booze was just a dime a bottle boy, you couldn't even buy the smell""  
I said, ""I knew there was something I liked about this town.""  
But it takes more than that to bring me down, down, down.  
'Cause there's still a lot of wine and lonely girls  
In this best of all possible worlds  
Well, they finally came and told me they was a gonna set me free  
And I'd be leavin' town if I knew what was good for me  
I said, ""It's nice to learn that ev'rybody's so concerned about my  
health.""  
(They were obsessed with it)  
I said, ""I won't be leavin' no more quicker than I can  
'Cause I've enjoyed about as much of this as I can stand  
And I don't need this town of yours more than I never needed nothin'

And lots of pretty thoughts that I ain't thunk

A slave to a job that meant nothing to me  
With three shiny new cars and a split level home  
To furnish the tomb I was dying to own

Aware of a world that was passing me by

Would mean not a thing when my body was cold  
  
Chorus  
Because life is a song for the dying to sing  
And it's got to have feeling to mean anything  
And a man can get by without silver or gold  
With bread for the body and song for the soul  
  
I'm living my life by the lesson I've learned  
And not looking back at the bridges I've burned  
Cause the time that we travel from cradle to grave  
Was meant to be spent and not meant to be saved  
  
And I know there are some who will say I'm a fool  
But I don't give a damn for the people that do  
Cause if down in a dungeon is where they belong  
Well, that's their misfortune and none of my own

And fight to build a new and better day

Music was his magic and his madness rolled in one  
It's said he charmed the fairest hearts of this world's fairest maidens  
  
Quick as silver mercury and slippery as a song  
  
Winding like a river through a thirsty world of strangers  
Carving out a legend in a dream-forsaken land  
Silver took his pleasures just as freely as he gave them  
'cause hungry eyes weren't quick enough for silver's flashing hands  
  
Then once upon escaping from the world of silk and shadows  
Sudden growin' sicker of the secrets and the shame  
He stumbled onto something real that beckoned like a candle  
And never lookin' backwards, he surrendered to the flame

Because hunger, is the surface, of a darkened pool of sadness  
Silver pale reflection of a deeper need below  
Mystery and magic are the holy forms of madness  
Sacred as the ecstasy that slumbers in your soul  
  
Silver moved instinctively within her soft defenses  
Soon unfolding mysteries he'd never seen before  
And wakening an ancient need, she slipped inside his senses  
And silver took it easy as the closing of a door  
  
Then soon he touched the secret fears she'd hidden with her sorrows  
Darker than her raven hair and deeper than her eyes  
And dared to try to lead her to the sunlight from her shadows  
Following the line between her laughter and her lies  
  
But silver left his magic with the legend he'd abandoned  
Love had stripped him naked of illusion and it's charms  
Then one long night her changing mind took kindly to a stranger  
And morning found her moving in the golden stranger's arms  
  
Chorus:  
Because hunger, is the surface, of a darkened pool of sadness  
Silver pale reflection of a deeper need below  
Mystery and magic are the holy forms of madness  
Sacred as the ecstasy that slumbers in your soul  
  
Silver stared in silence at the tangled scene before him  
Time was burning frozen in the oceans of his eyes  
And sadly turning backwards to the world that he'd forsaken  
He donned the shining mantle of deception and disguise  
  
Slowly, with the patience born of silent desperation  
Silver worked his way into the darkness of her mind  
Weaving through her conscience like a chance she might have taken  
Sadder than the shadows of the love she'll never find  
  
And silver's spell was stronger than the softly smiling stranger  
Whose star was burning smaller in the naked light of day  
And silver took her hand again, a wiser man, but sadder  
Ready for the stranger who would steal her love away  
  
Chorus:  
Because hunger, is the surface, of a darkened pool of sadness  
Silver pale reflection of a deeper need below  
Mystery and magic are the holy forms of madness  
Sworn to free the ecstasy that slumbers in your soul

"I took myself down to the Tally-Ho Tavern to buy me a bottle of beer  
I sat me down by a tender young maiden whose eyes were as dark as her hair  
And as I was searchin' from bottle to bottle for somethin' unfoolish to say  
That silver tongued devil just slipped from the shadows and smilingly stole
her away  
I said hey little girl don't you know he's the devil he's everything that I
ain't  
Hidin' intentions of evil under the smile of a saint  
All he's good for is gettin' in trouble and shifting his share of the blame  
And some people swear he's my double and some even say we're the same  
But the silver tongued devil's got nothing to lose I'll only live till I die  
We take our own chances and pay our own dues the silver tongued devil and I  
Like all the fair maidens who've laid down beside him  
She knew in her heart that he'd lied  
But nothing that I could have said could've saved her  
No matter how hard that she tried  
Cause she'll offer her soul to the darkness and danger  
Of something that she's never known  
And open her arms at the smile of a stranger who'll love her and leave her
alone  
And you know he's the devil...

I was a sailor. I was born upon the tide  
And with the sea I did abide.  
I sailed a schooner round the Horn to Mexico  
I went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow  
And when the yards broke off they said that I got killed  
But I am living still.  
  
I was a dam builder across the river deep and wide  
Where steel and water did collide  
A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado  
I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below  
They buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound  
But I am still around.. I'll always be around.. And around and around and  
Around and around  
  
I fly a starship across the Universe divide  
And when I reach the other side  
I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can  
Perhaps I may become a highwayman again  
Or I may simply be a single drop of rain  
But I will remain  
And I'll be back again, and again and again and again and again..

Of yesterday

Where there's nothing above  
And there's nothing below  
And it's time for the burden  
It's time for the whip  
Will she walk through the flame  
Can he shoot from the hip  
  
So he binds himself  
To the galloping mare  
And she binds herself  
To the rider there  
And there is no space  
But there's left and right  
And there is no time  
But there's day and night  
  
And he leans on her neck  
And he whispers low  
""Whither thou goest  
I will go""

And they head for the plain  
No need for the whip  
Ah, no need for the rein

Who fastens it tight?  
Who snaps it asunder

"Ah the man she wanted all her life was hanging by a thread  
""I never even knew how much I wanted you,"" she said.  
His muscles they were numbered and his style was obsolete.  
""O baby, I have come too late."" She knelt beside his feet.  
""I'll never see a face like yours in years of men to come  
I'll never see such arms again in wrestling or in love.""  
And all his virtues burning in the smoky Holocaust  
She took unto herself most everything her lover lost  
Now the master of this landscape he was standing at the view  
With a sparrow of St. Francis that he was preaching to  
She beckoned to the sentry of his high religious mood  
She said, ""I'll make a place between my legs,  
I'll show you solitude.""  
  
He offered her an orgy in a many mirrored room  
He promised her protection for the issue of her womb  
She moved her body hard against a sharpened metal spoon  
She stopped the bloody rituals of passage to the moon  
  
She took his much admired oriental frame of mind  
And the heart-of-darkness alibi his money hides behind  
She took his blonde Madonna and his monastery wine  
""This mental space is occupied and everything is mine.""  
  
He tried to make a final stand beside the railway track  
She said, ""The art of longing's over and it's never coming back.""  
She took his tavern parliament, his cap, his cocky dance,  
She mocked his female fashions and his working-class mustache.  
  
The last time that I saw him he was trying hard to get  
A woman's education but he's not a woman yet  
And the last time that I saw her she was living with some boy  
Who gives her soul an empty room and gives her body joy.  
  
So the great affair is over but whoever would have guessed  
It would leave us all so vacant and so deeply unimpressed  
It's like our visit to the moon or to that other star  
I guess you go for nothing if you really want to go that far.

From those nights in Tiananmen Square.  
It's coming from the feel  
That this ain't exactly real,  
Or it's real, but it ain't exactly there.

From the sirens night and day,  
From the fires of the homeless,

Democracy is coming to the U.S.A.  
  
It's coming from the women and the men.

So we'll go no more a-roving  
So late into the night,

And the moon be still as bright.  
For the sword outwears its sheath,  
And the soul outwears the breast,  
And the heart must pause to breathe,  
And love itself have rest.  
Though the night was made for loving,  
And the day returns too soon,  
Yet we'll go no more a-roving  
By the light of the moon.

God is alive, magic is afoot  
God is alive, magic is afoot  
God is alive, magic is afoot  
God is afoot, magic is alive  
Alive is afoot, magic never died  
God never sickened  
Many poor men lied  
Many sick men lied  
Magic never weakened  
Magic never hid  
Magic always ruled  
God is afoot, God never died  
God was ruler  
Though his funeral lengthened  
Though his mourners thickened  
Magic never fled  
Though his shrouds were hoisted  
The naked God did live  
Though his words were twisted  
The naked magic thrived  
Though his death was published  
Round and round the world  
The heart did not believe  
  
Many hurt men wondered  
Many struck men bled  
Magic never faltered  
Magic always lead  
Many stones were rolled  
But God would not lie down  
Many wild men lied  
Many fat men listened  
Though they offered stones  
Magic still was fed  
Though they locked their coffers  
God was always served  
Magic is afoot, God is alive  
Alive is afoot  
  
Alive is in command  
Many weak men hungered  
Many strong men thrived  
Though they boast of solitude  
God was at their side  
Nor the dreamer in his cell  
Nor the captain on the hill  
Magic is alive  
Though his death was pardoned  
Round and round the world  
The heart would not believe  
  
Though laws were carved in marble  
They could not shelter men  
Though altars built in parliaments  
They could not order men  
Police arrested magic and magic went with them  
Mmmmm.... For magic loves the hungry  
But magic would not tarry  
It moves from arm to arm  
It would not stay with them  
Magic is afoot  
It cannot come to harm  
It rests in an empty palm  
It spawns in an empty mind  
But magic is no instrument  
Magic is the end  
Many men drove magic  
But magic stayed behind  
Many strong men lied  
They only passed through magic  
And out the other side  
Many weak men lied  
They came to God in secret  
And though they left Him nourished  
They would not tell who healed  
Though mountains danced before them  
They said that God was dead  
Though his shrouds were hoisted  
The naked God did live  
This I mean to whisper to my mind  
This I mean to laugh within my mind  
This I mean my mind to serve  
Til' service is but magic  
Moving through the world  
And mind itself is magic  
Coursing through the flesh  
And flesh itself is magic  
Dancing on a clock  
And time itself  
The magic length of God

Cut down in your love  
Forced to kneel in the mud next to me  
Ah but why so bitterly turn from the one  
Who kneels there as deeply as thee  
  
Children have takes these pledges  
They have ferried them out of the past  
Oh beyond all the graves and the hedges  
Where love must go hiding at last  
And here where there is no description  
Oh here in the moment at hand  
No sinner need rise up forgiven  
No victim need limp to the stand  
  
And you say you've been humbled in love  
And look dear heart, look at the virgin  
Look how she welcomes him into her gown  
Yes, and mark how the stranger's cold armour  
Dissolves like a star falling down  
Why trade this vision for desire  
When you may have them both  
You will never see a man this naked  
I will never hold a woman this close  
  
And you say you've been humbled in love

Like he was giving up the holy game of poker  
And while he talks his dreams to sleep  
You notice there's a highway  
That is curling up like smoke above his shoulder  
It is curling just like smoke above his shoulder.  
  
You tell him to come in sit down  
But something makes you turn around  
The door is open you can't close your shelter  
You try the handle of the road  
It opens do not be afraid  
It's you my love, you who are the stranger  
It's you my love, you who are the stranger.  
  
Well, I've been waiting, I was sure  
We'd meet between the trains we're waiting for  
I think it's time to board another  
Please understand, I never had a secret chart  
To get me to the heart of this  
Or any other matter  
When he talks like this  
You don't know what he's after  
When he speaks like this,  
You don't know what he's after.  
  
Let's meet tomorrow if you choose  
Upon the shore, beneath the bridge  
That they are building on some endless river  
Then he leaves the platform  
For the sleeping car that's warm  
You realize, he's only advertising one more shelter  
And it comes to you, he never was a stranger  
And you say ok the bridge or someplace later.  
  
And then sweeping up the jokers that he left behind ...  
  
And leaning on your window sill ...  
  
I told you when I came I was a stranger.

Taking the chances  
Of one who is lost  
  
Feeling his way  
To a cleaner expression  
Of whatever it was  
He stumbled across  
  
All for the sake

For the sake of his longing  
We came to the window  
He put on his cloths  
And he walked through the smoke  
  
All for the sake

Riding to him  
On a flicker of hope  
  
Some tourist of beauty  
In full disappointment  
Ready to fall  
In love with a ghost

To the highest reward  
  
And now it was ready

(Michael) Their bodies Triumphant  
Their power unfurled  
I know I am nothing  
And women the world!  
  
A slave to their favours  
Their no and their yes  
I'm crushed in the crease  
Of a cotton dress  
  
And I'm dead except  
In their company  
And I'm only at rest  
When they motion to me  
  
And night after night  
I turn to myself  
And I raise them  
Out of my panic  
And they come to me  
Willing at last  
Inflamed and fast  
Mutual and graphic.  
  
And suddenly they drill my heart  
With cavities of absence  
And they cover their thighs  
With cellophane  
And they cover their breasts  
With a shadow  
And they nail my good right hand  
To a wall in the attic

From the thorns and the fire  
And let me recline  
On the Throne of Desire  
  
From the Throne of Desire

"Now the Swan it floated on the English river  
Ah the Rose of High Romance it opened wide  
A sun tanned woman yearned me through the summer  
And the judges watched us from the other side  
  
I told my mother ""Mother I must leave you  
Preserve my room but do not shed a tear  
Should rumour of a shabby ending reach you  
It was half my fault and half the atmosphere""  
  
But the Rose I sickened with a scarlet fever  
And the Swan I tempted with a sense of shame  
She said at last I was her finest lover  
And if she withered I would be to blame  
  
The judges said you missed it by a fraction  
Rise up and brace your troops for the attack  
Ah the dreamers ride against the men of action  
Oh see the men of action falling back  
  
But I lingered on her thighs a fatal moment  
I kissed her lips as though I thirsted still  
My falsity had stung me like a hornet  
The poison sank and it paralyzed my will  
  
I could not move to warn all the younger soldiers  
That they had been deserted from above  
So on battlefields from here to Barcelona  
I'm listed with the enemies of love  
  
And long ago she said ""I must be leaving,  
Ah but keep my body here to lie upon  
You can move it up and down and when I'm sleeping  
Run some wire through that Rose and wind the Swan""  
  
So daily I renew my idle duty  
I touch her here and there, I know my place  
I kiss her open mouth and I praise her beauty  
And people call me traitor to my face

Abandoned to beauty and pride

Lost in the rags of remorse  
Lost in the waves of a sickness  
That loosens the high silver nerves

And leave no observer to mourn  
But climb on your tears and be silent  
Like a rose on its ladder of thorns

Then lay your rose on the fire

The sun give over to splendour

"[Dedicated to A. M. Klein (1909-1972)]  
Hurt once and for all into silence.  
A long pain ending without a song to prove it.  
Who could stand beside you so close to Eden,  
When you glinted in every eye the held-high  
Razor, shivering every ram and son?  
And now the silent loony bin, where  
The shadows live in the rafters like  
Day-weary bats,  
Until the turning mind, a radar signal,  
Lures them to exaggerate  
Mountain-size on the white stone wall  
Your tiny limp.  
How can I leave you in such a house?  
Are there no more saints and wizards  
To praise their ways with pupils,  
No more evil to stun with the slap  
Of a wet red tongue?  
Did you confuse the Messiah in a mirror  
And rest because he had finally come?  
Let me cry Help beside you, Teacher.  
I have entered under this dark roof  
As fearlessly as an honoured son  
Enters his father's house.

They're lining up the prisoners  
And the guards are taking aim  
I struggled with some demons  
They were middle-class and tame  
I didn't know I had permission to murder and to maim  
You want it darker  
  
Hineni, hineni  
I'm ready, my Lord  
  
Magnified, sanctified, be thy holy name  
Vilified, crucified, in the human frame  
A million candles burning for the love that never came  
You want it darker  
We kill the flame  
  
If you are the dealer, let me out of the game  
If you are the healer, I'm broken and lame  
If thine is the glory, mine must be the shame  
You want it darker  
  
Hineni, hineni  
Hineni, hineni  
I'm ready, my Lord

"The ponies run, the girls are young,  
The odds are there to beat.  
You win a while, and then it's done  
Your little winning streak.  
And summoned now to deal  
With your invincible defeat,  
You live your life as if it's real,  
A Thousand Kisses Deep.  
  
I'm turning tricks, I'm getting fixed,  
I'm back on Boogie Street.  
You lose your grip, and then you slip  
Into the Masterpiece.  
And maybe I had miles to drive,  
And promises to keep:  
You ditch it all to stay alive,  
A Thousand Kisses Deep.  
  
And sometimes when the night is slow,  
The wretched and the meek,  
We gather up our hearts and go,  
A Thousand Kisses Deep.  
  
Confined to sex, we pressed against  
The limits of the sea:  
I saw there were no oceans left  
For scavengers like me.  
I made it to the forward deck.  
I blessed our remnant fleet  
And then consented to be wrecked,  
A Thousand Kisses Deep.  
  
I'm turning tricks, I'm getting fixed,  
I'm back on Boogie Street.  
I guess they won't exchange the gifts  
That you were meant to keep.  
And quiet is the thought of you,  
The file on you complete,  
Except what we forgot to do,  
A Thousand Kisses Deep.  
  
And sometimes when the night is slow,  
The wretched and the meek,  
We gather up our hearts and go,  
A Thousand Kisses Deep.

There ain't no drink no drug

There's nothing pure enough to be a cure for love  
  
I see you in the subway and I see you on the bus  
I see you lying down with me, I see you waking up  
I see your hand, I see your hair  
Your bracelets and your brush  
And I call to you, I call to you  
But I don't call soft enough  
There ain't no cure,  
There ain't no cure,  
There ain't no cure for love

When the sweetest voice I ever heard, whispered to my soul  
I don't need to be forgiven for loving you so much  
It's written in the scriptures  
It's written there in blood  
I even heard the angels declare it from above  
There ain't no cure,  
There ain't no cure,

The birth betrayed  
The marriage spent

Signs for all to see.  
  
I can't run no more  
With that lawless crowd  
While the killers in high places  
Say their prayers out loud.  
But they've summoned, they've summoned up  
A thundercloud  
And they're going to hear from me.  
  
Ring the bells that still can ring  
  
You can add up the parts  
But you won't have the sum  
You can strike up the march,  
There is no drum  
Every heart, every heart  
To love will come  
But like a refugee.

Which you can't reveal to the ears of youth  
Except to say it isn't worth a dime

All of the elephants lie down,  
I thought you were the crown prince  
Of all the wheels in Ivory Town.  
  
Just take a look at your body now,  
There's nothing much to save  
And a bitter voice in the mirror cries,  
""Hey, Prince, you need a shave.""  
  
Now if you can manage to get  
Your trembling fingers to behave,  
Why don't you try unwrapping  
A stainless steel razor blade?

Yes it's come to this,  
And wasn't it a long way down,  
Wasn't it a strange way down?

And the cold is running thin.  
Well, what do you expect from  
The kind of places you've been living in?  
  
Don't drink from that cup,

Once there was a path  
And a girl with chestnut hair,  
And you passed the summers  
Picking all of the berries that grew there  
There were times she was a woman,  
Oh, there were times she was just a child,  
And you held her in the shadows  
Where the raspberries grow wild.  
  
And you climbed the twilight mountains  
And you sang about the view,  
And everywhere that you wandered  
Love seemed to go along with you.  
That's a hard one to remember,  
Yes it makes you clench your fist.  
  
And then the veins stand out like highways,  
All along your wrist.  
And yes it's come to this,  
It's come to this,  
And wasn't it a long way down,  
Wasn't it a strange way down?  
  
You can still find a job,  
Go out and talk to a friend.  
On the back of every magazine  
There are those coupons you can send.  
Why don't you join the Rosicrucians,  
They can give you back your hope,  
You can find your love with diagrams  
On a plain brown envelope.  
  
But you've used up all your coupons  
Except the one that seems  
To be written on your wrist  
Along with several thousand dreams.  
  
Now Santa Claus comes forward,  
That's a razor in his mit  
And he puts on his dark glasses  
And he shows you where to hit  
And then the cameras pan,

"There was a child named Bernadette  
I heard the story long ago  
She saw the queen of heaven once  
And kept the vision in her soul  
No one believed what she had seen  
No one believed what she heard  
But there were sorrows to be healed  
And mercy, mercy in this world  
  
So many hearts I find, broke like yours and mine  
Torn by what we have done and can't undo  
I just want to hold you, won't you let me hold you  
Like Bernadette would do  
  
We've been around, we fall, we fly  
We mostly fall, we mostly run  
And every now and then we try  
To mend the damage that we've done  
Tonight, tonight I just can't rest  
I've got this joy in my breast  
To Think that I did not forget that child  
That song of Bernadette  
  
So many hearts I find, broke like yours and mine  
Torn by what we've done and can't undo  
I just want to hold you, won't you let me hold you  
Like Bernadette would do

"The door it opened slowly,  
My father he came in,  
I was nine years old.  
And he stood so tall above me,  
His blue eyes they were shining  
And his voice was very cold.  
He said, ""I've had a vision  
And you know I'm strong and holy,  
I must do what I've been told.""  
So he started up the mountain,  
I was running, he was walking,  
And his axe was made of gold.  
  
Well, the trees they got much smaller,  
The lake a lady's mirror,  
We stopped to drink some wine.  
Then he threw the bottle over.  
Broke a minute later  
And he put his hand on mine.  
Thought I saw an eagle  
But it might have been a vulture,  
I never could decide.  
Then my father built an altar,  
He looked once behind his shoulder,  
He knew I would not hide.  
  
You who build these altars now  
To sacrifice these children,  
You must not do it anymore.  
A scheme is not a vision  
And you never have been tempted  
By a demon or a god.  
You who stand above them now,  
Your hatchets blunt and bloody,  
You were not there before,  
When I lay upon a mountain  
And my father's hand was trembling  
With the beauty of the word.  
  
And if you call me brother now,  
Forgive me if I inquire,  
""just according to whose plan?""  
When it all comes down to dust  
I will kill you if I must,  
I will help you if I can.  
When it all comes down to dust  
I will help you if I must,  
I will kill you if I can.  
And mercy on our uniform,  
Man of peace or man of war,  
The peacock spreads his fan.

"Suzanne takes you down to her place near the river,  
You can hear the boats go by you can spend the night beside her,  
And you know that she's half crazy but that's why you wanna be there,  
And she feeds you tea and oranges that come all the way from China,  
And just when you mean to tell her that you have no love to give her,  
Then she gets you on her wavelength and she lets the river answer,  
That you've always been her lover.  
  
[Chorus]  
And you want to travel with her,  
And you want to travel blind,  
And you know that she will trust you,  
For you've touched her perfect body with your mind.  
  
And Jesus was a sailor when He walked upon the water,  
And He spent a long time watching from His lonely wooden tower,  
And when He knew for certain only drowning men could see him,  
He said ""all men will be sailors then until the sea shall free them,""  
But He Himself was broken, long before the sky would open  
Forsaken, almost human, He sank beneath your wisdom like a stone.  
  
[Chorus]  
And you want to travel with him,  
And you want to travel blind,  
And you think maybe you'll trust him,  
For he's touched your perfect body with his mind.  
  
Now Suzanne takes your hand and she leads you to the river,  
She is wearing rags and feathers from Salvation Army counters,  
And the sun pours down like honey on Our Lady of the Harbour,  
And she shows you where to look among the garbage and the flowers,  
There are heroes in the seaweed, there are children in the morning,  
They are leaning out for love and they will lean that way forever,  
While Suzanne holds the mirror.  
  
[Chorus]  
And you want to travel with her,  
And you want to travel blind,  
And you know that you can trust her,  
For she's touched your perfect body with her mind.

You fastened to the rein,

Whatever useless things these hands have done.  
Let me see your beauty broken down  
Like you would do for one you love.

I would like to try your charity  
Until you cry, ""Now you must try my greed.""

How near you sleep to me  
  
Just take this longing from my tongue

Through which the troops have passed,  
I stand in ruins behind you,  
With your winter clothes, your broken sandal straps.  
I love to see you naked over there  
Especially from the back.  
  
Oh take this longing from my tongue,  
All the useless things my hands have done,  
Untie for me your hired blue gown,  
Like you would do for one that you love.  
  
You're faithful to the better man,  
I'm afraid that he left.  
So let me judge your love affair  
In this very room where I have sentenced  
Mine to death.  
I'll even wear these old laurel leaves

"Now in Vienna there are ten pretty women  
There's a shoulder where Death comes to cry  
There's a lobby with nine hundred windows  
There's a tree where the doves go to die  
There's a piece that was torn from the morning,  
And it hangs in the Gallery of Frost  
  
Take this waltz, take this waltz  
Take this waltz with the clamp on its jaws  
I want you, I want you, I want you  
On a chair with a dead magazine  
In the cave at the tip of the lilly,  
In some hallway where love's never been  
On a bed where the moon has been sweating,  
In a cry filled with footsteps and sand  
  
Take this waltz, take this waltz  
Take its broken waist in your hand  
  
This waltz, this waltz, this waltz, this waltz  
With its very own breath of brandy and Death  
Dragging its tail in the sea  
  
There's a concert hall in Vienna  
Where your mouth had a thousand reviews  
There's a bar where the boys have stopped talking  
They've been sentenced to death by the blues  
Ah, but who is it climbs to your picture  
With a garland of freshly cut tears?  
  
Take this waltz, take this waltz  
Take this waltz, it's been dying for years  
  
There's an attic where children are playing,  
Where I've got to lie down with you soon,  
In a dream of Hungarian lanterns,  
In the mist of some sweet afternoon  
And I'll see what you've chained to your sorrow,  
All your sheep and your lillies of snow  
  
Take this waltz, take this waltz  
With its ""I'll never forget you, you know!""  
  
This waltz, this waltz, this waltz, this waltz  
With its very own breath of brandy and Death  
Dragging its tail in the sea  
  
And I'll dance with you in Vienna  
I'll be wearing a river's disguise  
The hyacinth wild on my shoulder,  
My mouth on the dew of your thighs  
And I'll bury my soul in a scrapbook,  
With the photographs there, and the moss  
And I'll yield to the flood of your beauty  
My cheap violin and my cross  
And you'll carry me down on your dancing  
To the pools that you lift on your wrist  
O my love, o my love  
Take this waltz, take this waltz  
It's yours now. It's all that there is

"Written by Redd Stewart and Pee Wee King  
Additional verse: Leonard Cohen  
  
I was dancing with my darlin'  
To the Tennessee Waltz  
When an old friend I happened to see  
Introduced him to my loved one  
And while they were waltzing  
My friend stole my sweetheart from me.  
I remember the night and the Tennessee Waltz  
Now I know just how much I have lost  
Yes I lost my little darlin'  
The night they were playing  
The beautiful Tennessee Waltz.  
She comes dancing through the darkness  
To the Tennessee Waltz  
And I feel like I'm falling apart  
And it's stronger than drink  
And it's deeper than sorrow  
This darkness she's left in my heart.

I don't trust my inner feelings  
Inner feelings come and go.  
  
How come you called me here tonight?  
How come you bother  
With my heart at all?  
You raise me up in grace,  
Then you put me in a place,  
Where I must fall.  
  
Too late to fix another drink  
The lights are going out  
I'll listen to the darkness sing  
I know what that's about.  
  
I tried to love you my way,  
But I couldn't make it hold.  
So I closed the Book of Longing  
And I do what I am told.  
  
How come you called me here tonight?  
How come you bother with my heart at all?  
You raise me up in grace,  
Then you put me in a place,  
Where I must fall.

"Deep down in the depths of forgotten dreams  
So far away, so long ago it seems  
The memory comes of a distant beach  
Pale sand stretching far from reach  
It was then I found my princess of the sand  
As I traced the foam, pebbles beneath my feet  
I looked behind, I saw this one so sweet  
She came to me and I saw in her eyes  
The heavy toll of a thousand eyes  
I called her my princess of the sand  
She stared at me and my mind was in a maze  
As we moved along in a summer sea-dream haze  
She moved her mouth but there came no sound  
The message she brought can never be found  
But I called her my princess of the sand  
One moment we walked with the night breeze in our face  
Then I looked, she'd gone of her presence, there was no trace  
Where she went or came from who can know  
Or if she'll ever return to help me know  
Who she is, my princess of the sand  
Sometime when the summer nights come back  
I'll go back to the sea, follow that sandy track  
I'll look around, hope to find  
That strange young dream, close behind  
I'll call her my princess of the sand

It's a big big love  
His aim is true  
Don't try to run  
Cupid's got a gun  
  
Don't you just sit there feeling sorry for yourself  
Reading romance novels and laying around the house  
Dreaming that the good parts were written just for you  
Then waking up saying this will never come true  
Stop your hesitating go out tonight  
You know he's out there waiting  
To get you in his sights  
  
Cupid's got a gun  
Arrows wouldn't do

It's a big big love  
His aim is true  
Don't try to run  
Cupid's got a gun  
  
It's a real tough job helping people fall in love  
That old bow and arrow just wasn't strong enough  
Cupid wasn't stupid, he knew just what to do  
Now he's loaded for love  
He's coming for you

No particular reason, he just dressed that way  
Brown necktie with a matching vest and both his wingtip shoes  
He built a closet on our back porch and put a penny in a burned-out fuse

Chain-smoked camel cigarettes, and hammered nails in planks  
He would level on the level, he shaved even every door  
And voted for Eisenhower, cause Lincoln won the war  
  
Well, he used to sing me ""blood on the saddle"" and rock me on his knee

Well, he'd drive to church on Sunday and he'd take me with him too  
Stained glass in every window, hearing aids in every pew

In a flock of a thou'

When you open your eyes

Together did blend  
Forming chords of awakening  
If I'm not here again  
For they shouted  
Never again would they fly  
In such numbers across  
Such a primitive sky

As it sank to the sand

"My heart was warm with family love as I slipped into a  
Chair  
beside my uncle john, my daughters 'cross the table there  
I'd walked the docks in misty rain, a pain was in my legs  
but I'd seen the dream of kinsmen in the boats of Killybegs  
  
the banter of my uncle and my daughters filled the air and  
The  
gunning brothers?(Donegalers) next to us were glad that we  
Were there  
I was kind of quiet listening at the window ledge  
for the music of the harbor, the birds of Killybegs  
  
down the coast not far was Galway land of joys (Joyce) and  
Kinnamar?  
at their (after) supper and asleep we would visit? (be  
Goin') there tomorrow  
I worried if my words would e'er be sung by Irishmen  
or out (rot) here on the docks??  
like the fish of Killybegs  
  
a radio was playing though we never heard a word (I don't  
Think this phrase is right)  
but the rhythm of the music was familiar if absurd  
and harkning  
(a heightening) intensity? for silence did I beg  
oh what a song was playing in the air of Killybegs  
  
I couldn't quite believe it for it sounded rather strange  
the instruments were different and the key had been changed  
I reached to turn the volume up then teetered on my legs  
A girl from Tipperary sang my song in Killybegs

Fell in love for the wrong reasons  
Gave our hearts then lost control

Throw away the rear view mirror  
Adios and let it roll  
  
Now everybody takes their chances  
Everybody has to choose  
But when love hangs in the balance  
There's an innocence you lose

Feel the tears slowly descending

"There's a little mountain church in my thoughts of yesterday  
Where friends and family gathered for the Lord  
Where an ol' fashioned preacher taught the straight and narrow way  
For what few coins the congregation could afford  
Dressed in all our Sunday best, we sat on pews of solid oak  
And I remember how our voices filled the air  
How Mama sounded like an angel on those high soprano notes  
And ""When the Roll is Called Up Yonder I'll Be There""  
Looking back now that little mountain church house  
Has become my life's cornerstone  
It was there in that little mountain church house  
I first heard the words I based my life upon  
At the all day Sunday singing, with dinner on the ground  
Many were the souls that were revived  
While the brothers and the sisters who've gone on to Gloryland  
Slept in peace in the maple grove nearby

"Way back in my memory there's a scene that I recall  
Of a little run-down cabin in the woods  
Where my dad never promised that our blue moon would turn gold  
But he laid awake nights wishin' that it would.  
  
When the world was on our radio, hard work was on our minds.  
We lived our day-to-day in plain dirt fashion,  
With ol' overalls and cotton balls all strapped across your back  
Man, it's hard to make believe there ain't nothing wrong.  
  
But momma kept the Bible read and daddy kept our family fed,  
And somewhere in between I must have grown  
Cause someday I was dreamin' that a song that I was singin'  
Takes me down the road to where I want to go.  
  
Now I know, it's a long hard road  
  
Sometimes I remember when I stay up late at night,  
When the sun-up came, we got up and went  
In the shadows of a working' day, our moonlight hours spent  
Singin' songs along with gramma's radio.  
  
Now I'm beatin' down a ol' blacktop road, sleepin' in a sack,  
Livin' in my memories all in vain  
'cause those city lights ain't all that bright, compared to what it's like  
To see lightning bugs go dancin' in the rain.  
  
Momma played the guitar then, and daddy made the saw blade bend,  
And raindrops played the tin roof like a drum.  
But I just kept on dreamin' that a song that I was singin'  
Takes me down the road to where my name is known.  
  
Now I'm gone, and it's a long hard road  
Yes, I know, it's a long hard road.

The longest day I live I'll still be sufferin' from the shame  
While in the gutter you were makin' yourself quite a name  
The loneliness is all that I regret  
Losin' you might be the best thing yet  
  
Patiently I sit at home and wait,wonderin' where you are  
And what you are doin' has turned my love to hate  
I wanted you and you wanted anyone you could get

Was his constant companion.  
You'd see them out riding at dawn.

He still sits beside her,

That old song he would play.

But he'd spit and slap his side  
Just to see if he's alive

He said whoa-oh, singing oh Santa Rosa  
Whoa-oh, high and low-oh-oo  
Then one day, sang ol' Craig,

'Cause he feared the posse close behind might flush us out

To the tune of Cripple Creek  
He was murdered by a man from Santa Rosa

A-He had the nerve and he had the blood  
And there never was a hoss like the Tennessee stud

I raced my hoss with the Spaniard's foal  
Till I got me a skin full of silver and gold

There's a fire in the sky  
It's like the light in your eyes  
Oh, it's true  
That I won't give up till your in my arms  
Never give up till what's lost is found  
Won't give up on your sweet, sweet love

"Sat here by this stony brook until the Grey day turned to dust  
When up swam a fish with a children's book thought that I was lost  
He was on his way to the salmon hop, that's where they go to breed  
Saw me sitting on this log and thought I'd like to read  
  
[Chorus:]  
The night was cloudy but the moon he found a hole  
Said that he felt bad for me cause I had no place to go  
  
Why aren't you at the harvest ball with some sweet young gal  
You just sit like a bump on the log and call that fish your pal  
  
Well, I told him I was an orphan lived here all alone  
But many people have often tried to catch and take me home  
They never caught me  
  
Thought that I was a hiding, call this log my home  
But the fish and the moon and a sweet young gal  
All want me for their own  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So I met that gal at the harvest ball, she took me to her room  
While I slept in children's dreams, the fish ran away with the moon  
The fish ran away with the moon  
The fish ran away with the moon

Across the field where the creek turns back by the ole stump road  
I'm gonna take you to a special place that nobody knows  
Baby get ready..... Ooooooooooo

Lying on our backs and counting the stars  
Where the cool grass grows.  
Down by the river in the full moon light,  
We'll be fallin' in love in the middle of the night  
Just movin' slow...  
  
Stayin' the whole night thru, feels so good to be with you...  
  
Spring is almost over and the summer's come  
And the days are gettin' long  
Waited all winter for the time to be right, just to take you along

Jump in the river and cool ourselves from the heat of the night

Same these days, I think about her  
Dream up ways to live with out her  
We made vows that I can not excuse  
Yes forever don't last the way it used too  
  
We filled the church and hired a preacher  
I raised her veil to reach her  
Lives on the promise of her youth  
But forever don't last the way it used too  
  
Eternity can not be messed with

Enough coals, hotter hell you fool  
Then you swear an oath and then take it back, anytime you choose

Get a new form son, don't become confused

Ignoring the journey and moving so fast

The Great Wall of Skin -- Know the Way  
  
The bloodless husbands are jesters who listen  
Like sheep to the shrieks and commands of their wives

Womanwood bliss -- I am strong

Honest and clear - Feel the change  
As a river that flows - Know the Way

Like newspapers flaming in mind suicide  
Godless and sexless directionless loons  
Their sham sandcastles dissolve in the tide  
They put on their deathmasks and compromise daily  
The new children will live for the elders have died  
And I wave goodbye to America

Oh sometimes in the morning Lord a voice comes ringing through

"Although you've spoken many times before  
A sight of birth he leaves you by a door  
And now you know he doesn't understand  
And all you need is the warmth of his hand  
And if he'd smile your loving blood would dance  
One silent kiss leaves you in a trance  
And now you know you cannot live alone  
But you will find your future is unknown  
One day the questions rise, on wings of chance you fly  
And on that day your laughs and tears will die  
And fall as free as seabirds climb the skies  
And you will love when love comes your way  
And when it comes there's nothing more to say  
And now you know he doesn't understand  
And now you know you don't need his hand  
One day the questions die, on wings of chance you fly

No words of advice  
Nothin' to offer a stranger  
Gone the love, gone the spite  
It just doesn't matter no longer

The ground's gettin' close

Your carpets are faded, your walls are all gray  
There's dust on your silver and cracks in your crystal  
All your young servants have drifted away

"Well, Billy went down to the battleground  
To find a little trinket he could call his own  
Didn't see nothin' lying around  
He decided he'd dig awhile  
Well he dug her up and he dug her down  
'Fore too long he found some bones  
Poor little Billy couldn't make a sound  
When the bones sat up and smiled  
  
Oh Billy you seem like a fine young man  
No reason to be a tremblin' soul  
Come over here and shake my hand  
Make my proud acquaintance  
Well Billy he was stunned he could hardly stand  
Whether he could move he didn't know  
But he knew he had to formulate some kinda plan  
Or try the boneman's patience  
  
The first thing he wanted to do was breathe  
So he gulped in some of that battleground air  
Next thing he wanted to do was leave  
But Billy wasn't raised up rude  
Well the boneman grunted and he gave a heave  
All of a sudden he was loomin' there  
Shakin' off dirt and actin' pleased  
Things didn't look too good  
  
Well Billy decided what the hell  
You don't meet a boneman every day  
A little bit skinny but you never can tell  
He might be a pretty good guy  
Well they started off with the old soft sell  
'Fore too long they were jawin' away  
By the time the darkness fell  
They were seein' socket to eye  
  
They decided right then on a life of crime  
With the boneman's looks and Billy's brains  
They could scare old Scrooge out of his last dime  
Might as well have a go  
Billy he would picked the place and time  
From the corner store to the railroad train  
Boney'd flash him a smile sublime  
And Billy he'd grab the dough  
  
They decided they might as well start right then  
Time's awastin' so they say  
They headed for the park  
Where the lights are dim  
And only the foolish tread  
He was whistlin' a tune  
When they spotted him strollin' along  
So plump and gay  
Boney gave him a great big grin  
And Billy snagged his bread  
  
Next come a lady of the night  
Boney saddled up and said hello  
Gave the poor thing such a terrible fright  
She fainted dead away  
Billy lifted her purse and her earrings bright  
Diamond rings and watch you know  
Couldn't figure out try as they might  
Why they'd ever worked a single day  
  
Billy's plans ended up in ruin you know  
They were workin' a quaint little neighborhood  
Spied an old lady about eighty or so  
Almost looked too easy  
Boney put on a pretty good show  
The little ol' lady didn't see too good  
My kind Sir your all bones you know  
You need something hot and greasy  
  
Grabbed ol' Boney drug him inside  
Billy peeked in through the window sill  
She fed him boiled and baked and fried  
Ol' Boney he's chewin like crazy  
He gobbled up everything he tried  
Pounds added on like you know they will  
Billy laid down in the dirt and cried  
Watchin Boney Gettin fat and lazy  
  
Well Billy's back workin his job by day  
Sleep'n nights it ain't so bad  
Never liked stealin anyway  
Kinda gives a guy the willies  
Boney and Ma got a new cafe  
Best baked beans you ever had  
Ma's expecting any day  
And they say they're gonna name him Billy

Inside them  
When the battle's been fought and they all been taught  
That the trick is just not being caught  
Will you give them hell, Miss Carousel,

When the need arose your eyes fell closed  
You clamped your fingers round your nose

You haven't got the authority  
To kill him in the first degree

If you have something to begrudge him

Of those that come to pray and preach  
The natural man who tries to stand  
Is fallin

You own his legs but his mind is free  
Only you can tell, Miss Carousel,  
How long will he be crawling?

Seem there ain't no hope at all  
To reach the top even though you stop

"When the wind don't blow in Amarillo  
And the moon along  
The Gunnison don't rise  
Shall I cast my dreams  
Upon your love, babe  
And lie beneath  
The laughter of your eyes  
It's snowin' on Raton  
Come morning I'll be through  
Them hills and gone  
Mother thinks the road  
Is long and lonely  
Little brother thinks  
The road is straight and fine  
Little darling thinks  
The road is soft and lovely  
I'm thankful that old road  
Is a friend of mine  
Bid the years good-bye  
You cannot still them  
You cannot turn  
The circles of the sun  
You cannot count the miles  
Until you feel them  
And you cannot hold  
A lover that has gone  
Tomorrow the mountains  
Will be sleeping  
Silent 'neath a blanket  
Green and blue  
All that I shall hear  
The silence they are keeping  
I'll bring all their promises to you

It's just a feelin' but I can't shake it  
I keep on tryin but it's been so long  
  
If I hurt you I did not mean to  
I beg you pardon I did not want to  
When I leave you don't you think about me  
I won't be back babe I'll be long gone

Seems it's over before I'm started  
The time comes and I don't feel it

"Among the strangest things I ever heard  
Was when a friend of mine said ""Man, let's get some Thunderbird""  
I said ""What's that?"" he just started to grin  
Slobbered on his shirt, his eyes got dim  
He said ""You got fifty-nine cents?""  
  
I said ""Yeah, I got a dollar, but don't be a smartalec  
I ain't gonna spend it on no Indian relic""  
And he said ""Thunderbird's not an old Indian trinket,  
It's a wine, man, you take it home and drink it.""  
I said ""It sure don't sound like wine to me""  
And he said he'd bet me the change from my dollar  
  
We hustled on down to the nearest you-Tate-Um  
The guy wanted my ID, I whipped her out and showed him  
He got a green bottle from the freezing vault  
My friend started doing backward somersaults  
Through the cottage cheese  
  
Took it back to his house, started drinkin'  
Pretty soon I set in to thinkin'  
""Man, this Thunderbird tastes yummy, yummy, yummy  
And I know it's doing good things to my tummy, tum, t""  
It's so you reason when your on that crap  
  
Got a few more bottles, chugged them down  
I pulled myself up off the ground  
Decided I go see my dearest sweet wife  
Who met me at the door with a carving knife  
Said ""Get them damn grape peel from between your teeth.""  
  
I could see we're gonna have a little misunderstanding  
I said ""Dear, I better get in touch with you later""  
She said ""Forget it, man, you're never touchin' me again!""  
  
Now I've seen the light and heard the word  
And I'm staying away from that ol' dirty Thunderbird  
A message come from heaven radiant, and fine,  
All I drink now is communion wine  
Six days a week

"The old woman finally caught me  
Sneakin' 'round her cave  
Her hair looked just like barbwire, boys  
And her smile just like the grave  
She asked me could I stay awhile  
I said I'd better go  
She slid her arm around my neck  
And sweetly whispered no  
  
It's cold and dark and lonely here  
As soon enough you'll see  
I'm oh so glad you stumbled in  
I've been cravin' company  
I cannot stay too long you know  
I left some friends at home  
Don't you fret about your friends  
Down here we're all alone  
  
What about my mother  
I can't just leave her there to mourn  
You don't have to think about her  
Just forget you were ever born  
I'll disappoint my father  
You know he worked so hard for me  
If you have to pay your father back  
Just send him some misery  
  
I'll miss, I said, a girl I know  
I can't just leave there to pine  
She's still got plenty of men to go  
I'm sure she'll do just fine  
What about my little boy  
She said, he's just like you  
Let a few short years roll by  
He'll end up down here too  
  
Then her pale green eyes began to glow  
She placed her hand on mine  
She smiled and said don't worry  
You'll get used to me in time  
As her cold tongue flickered toward  
I spun myself around  
Made a dive for the passageway  
But the walls come crashing down  
  
Now her eyes were the only light  
My fevered brain could see  
But I tore myself away from them  
And fell down to my knees  
I've come too far, I can't get back  
I beseeched the Gods of men  
Fame and fortune just laughed at me  
Then silence once again  
  
A whisper deep within  
Embrace the God of Love  
I lifted my face and through the tears  
I saw light fall from above  
  
I hurled myself into the wall  
I ripped and clawed my way  
Through the stinkin', clingin' loam  
Back to the light of day  
I crawled out into the wind again  
The sky upon my face  
I heard the earth sigh patiently  
As it slid back into place  
  
Now I'm back among the ones I love  
I'm loved by them in turn  
And it's only on the darkest night  
That green eyed memory burns  
So walk my friends, in the light of day  
Don't go sneakin' 'round no holes  
There just might be something down there  
Wants to gobble up your soul

And the velvet voices all shall join  
The singing  
  
The hall is filled to every corner  
By a tinkling hint of chimes  
A melody careens and crumbles  
Leaving just a trace behind  
A rhythm [palter and] faintly fails  
The silver on its wings  
And the velvet voices all shall join  
The singing  
  
The cymbals flash, the drums they crash  
The trumpets rise the song  
The brass beton plucks its diamonds  
From a glittering wall of almost dawn  
The crystal chords they slash the wind  
In humble majesty  
And the velvet voices all shall join

Just because she's been blindly deceived

Concerning the payment of monthly dues  
I never did know where that money went  
I never was sure it was well spent  
But I paid it  
I'm no trouble causer and besides I figured that's life

Some turned away, not to look back again  
  
One stood among them, I remember most clearly  
Her sorrows were heavy, and her laughter was slow  
I courted her gently, for I loved her most dearly  
And I came her majestic reflections to know  
  
Her words, like the mountain, stood lonely and lofty  
With her face like a daydream and her hair like the shawl  
Worn by a mourner, who steals away softly  
From those that would have him mourn nothing at all  
  
Endlessly sorrow rode high on the north wind  
Slashing and slicing to take him his toll  
Endlessly creatures of darkness were cutting  
Their paths through the walls that shelter the soul  
  
No longer gypsy-like sadness unending  
Her eyes - they lie hollow and her face petrified  
Some will go laughing and others condemning  
But who there among you could have told her goodbye?

Flushes fell on Gold like water  
Tens they paired and paired again  
But the aces only flew through heaven  
And the diamond jack called no man friend  
The diamond queen saw Muds ordeal  
Began to think of her long lost son  
Fell to her knees with a mother's mercy  
Prayed to the angels every one  
  
The diamond queen, she prayed and prayed  
And the diamond angel filled Muds hole  
The wicked king of clubs himself  
Fell in face down in front of Gold  
Now three kings come to Clubs command  
But the angels from the sky did ride  
Three kings up on the streets of Gold  
Three fireballs on the muddy side  
  
The club queen heard her husband's call  
But Lord that queen of diamond's joy  
When the outlaw in the heavenly hall  
Turned out to be a wandering boy  
Now Mud he checked and Gold bet all  
And Mud he raised and Gold did call  
And the smile just melted off his face  
When Mud turned over that diamond ace  
  
Now here's what this story's told  
If you feel like Mud you'll end up Gold  
If you feel like lost, you'll end up found  
So amigo, lay them raises down

With a long way to go  
So lend an ear to my singing

Follow her now, now and forever

Someday soon 'neath the light of the moon  
When the sun and the rain shine together  
I'll meet her down where the waters flow  
And continue to flow forever

Down on the banks of that beautiful river  
I'll wander, look for her forever

And the sun will rise soon  
On the false and the fair

The satin she's wearin'  
Is shimmering blue  
Outside my window her ladies are sleeping  
My dogs have gone hunting  
The howling is through  
  
So I reach for her hand and her eyes turns to poison  
And her hair turns to splinters,  
And her flesh turns to brine  
She leaps cross the room, she stands in the window  
And screams that my first-born  
Will surely be blind  
  
She throws herself out to the black of the nightfall  
She's parted her lips  
But she makes not a sound  
I fly down the stairway, and I run to the garden  
No trace of my true love  
Is there to be found  
  
So walk these hills lightly, and watch who you're lovin'

All shimmering blue

Pancho was a bandit boy,  
His horse was fast as polished steel  
He wore his gun outside his pants  
For all the honest world to feel.  
Pancho met his match you know  
On the deserts down in Mexico  
Nobody heard his dying words,  
Ah but that's the way it goes.

They could have had him any day  
They only let him slip away  
Out of kindness, I suppose.  
  
Lefty, he can't sing the blues  
All night long like he used to.  
The dust that Pancho bit down south  
Ended up in Lefty's mouth  
The day they laid poor Pancho low,  
Lefty split for Ohio  
Where he got the bread to go,  
There ain't nobody knows  
  
The poets tell how Pancho fell,  
And Lefty's living in cheap hotels  
The desert's quiet, Cleveland's cold,  
And so the story ends we're told  
Pancho needs your prayers it's true,  
But save a few for Lefty too  
He only did what he had to do,  
And now he's growing old

Thanks give you cannot see those sails

Ice we drank and leather did chew  
For the oceans are unwholesome there  
The dead that slid into the seas  
Did freeze before our eyes
