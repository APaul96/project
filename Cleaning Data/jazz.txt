I wrote a little love note with each present

From that moment she belonged to me  
  
Roses, roses, roses, I thank all the roses that bloom in the spring  
Love is a wonderful thing, the rest of my life I will bring her  
Roses and roses and roses of love

You've just got to see me through another day

The summer smiles, the summer knows  
And unashamed, she sheds her clothes  
The summer smoothes the restless sky  
And lovingly she warms the sand on which you lie  
The summer knows, the summer's wise  
She sees the doubts within your eyes  
And so she takes her summer time  
Tells the moon to wait and the sun to linger  
Twists the world 'round her summer finger  
Lets you see the wonder of her arms  
And if you've learned your lessons well  
There's little more for her to tell  
One last caress, it's time to dress for fall

Who will be satisfied  
Just to be by your side  
Who will kiss you, hold you tight  
Two silver silhouettes  
In the summer moonlight  
Will you walk along the beach  
Like we did last summer  
Counting stars way out of reach  
Like we did last summer  
Will you tell your heart, beware  
This is just a summer affair  
Or will you fall in love for keeps  
Like I did last summer

"My world is like a river, as dark as it is deep  
Night after night the past slips in and gathers all my sleep  
My days are just an endless stream of emptiness to me  
Filled only by the fleeting moments of her memory  
Sweet memories, sweet memories  
M-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-mm.  
She slipped into the silence of my dreams again last night  
Wandering from room to room, she's turning on each light  
Her laughter spills like water from the river to the sea  
And I'm swept away from sadness, clinging to her memory  
Sweet memories, sweet memories  
M-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-mm  
Sweet memories, sweet memories

Summers by the sea, a sailboat in Capri  
These memories shall be our very own  
  
Even though our dreams may vanish  
With the morning light  
We loved once in splendor  
How tender, how tender the night

To fight for the right without question or cause  
To be willing to march into hell for a heavenly cause

That my heart will lie peaceful and calm when I'm laid to my rest

Still strove with his last ounce of courage

"After one whole quart of brandy  
Like a daisy, I'm awake  
With no bromo-seltzer handy  
I don't even shake  
  
Men are not a new sensation  
I've done pretty well I think  
But this half-pint imitation  
Put me on the blink  
  
I'm wild again, beguiled again  
A simpering, whimpering child again  
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I  
  
Couldn't sleep and wouldn't sleep  
When love came and told me, I shouldn't sleep  
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I  
  
Lost my heart, but what of it  
He is cold I agree  
He can laugh, but I love it  
Although the laugh's on me  
  
I'll sing to him, each spring to him  
And long, for the day when I'll cling to him  
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I  
  
He's a fool and don't I know it  
But a fool can have his charms  
I'm in love and don't I show it  
Like a babe in arms  
  
Love's the same old sad sensation  
Lately I've not slept a wink  
Since this half-pint imitation  
Put me on the blink  
  
I've sinned a lot, I'm mean a lot  
But I'm like sweet seventeen a lot  
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I  
  
I'll sing to him, each spring to him  
And worship the trousers that cling to him  
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I  
  
When he talks, he is seeking  
Words to get, off his chest  
Horizontally speaking, he's at his very best  
  
Vexed again, perplexed again  
Thank god, I can be oversexed again  
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I  
  
Wise at last, my eyes at last,  
Are cutting you down to your size at last  
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - no more  
  
Burned a lot, but learned a lot  
And now you are broke, so you earned a lot  
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - no more  
  
Couldn't eat, was dispeptic  
Life was so hard to bear  
Now my heart's antiseptic  
Since you moved out of there  
  
Romance, finis. your chance, finis.  
Those ants that invaded my pants, finis.  
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - no more

From 1 o'clock til 4

When all I do is pour  
Black coffee

My Sunday dreams to dry

A woman's born to weep and fret  
To stay at home and tend her oven  
And drown her past regrets  
In coffee and cigarettes  
I'm moaning all the morning  
And mourning all the night  
And in between it's nicotine  
And not much heart to fight  
Black coffee  
Feelin' low as the ground  
It's driving me crazy just waiting for my baby  
To maybe come around... around  
I'm waiting for my baby  
To maybe come around  
My nerves have gone to pieces  
My hair is turning gray  
All I do is drink black coffee

And not dwell in it again and again and again  
Hold one hand with time  
And open your mind naturally

Shall I kiss the mouth, stroke the hair  
Undress her - do I dare  
Or bite into the vein above her heaving breast  
Ah, the sun best come up soon  
There's no telling with the moon over madness  
And when I see her face  
The tuft of hair beneath the lace  
I feel the fire of mortal men  
As she draws a languorous breath  
So full of life, so close to death  
I'm filled with wild revenge  
Shall I tear into her skin  
Let the beast inside me win  
I'm so uncertain  
Or shall I fight my heart no more  
Ease my lover to the floor  
And loose my burden  
What I'd give to know just what I am  
A monster or a man  
An angel born of Hell, or simply human flesh  
One of which is in this room  
Wondering 'neath the mood over madness  
Shall I tear into her skin  
Let the beast inside me win  
I'm so uncertain  
Or shall I end this lonely war  
Ease my lover to the floor  
And loose my burden  
Woman won't you hold me in your arms  
Before you come to harm  
And take this tender love and drive it through my chest  
Stike hard, do it soon  
There's no telling with the moon over madness  
My madness  
Over you

Where are my eyes  
Oh have I seen to much  
Have I lost my touch  
Losing directions from growing infections  
Poisoned desires of reaping life so young  
  
What will I be like  
When my head is bear  
And my legs are weak  
Will I be strong or barely keep alive  
When I'm thirty-five  
Reaching dimentions that shatter conventions  
Leads me to fear that I'm growing old too soon  
  
With every step and every breath  
It's farther from youth and closer to death  
And that things I've realized  
Now beckon me to shut my eyes  
And I will grow to the age of maybe eighty years  
In such little time  
With this venturous mind  
  
What am I saying  
Don't I know myself from experience  
I'll never change  
Nor cease to sail the sky  
Till the day I die  
I'll come to conclusion with fear or illusion  
I'll live how I feel  
Cause no matter how fast or how slow  
Youth will go

"Because I was afraid to speak when I was just a lad  
My father gave my nose a tweak and told me I was bad  
Then one day I learned a word that saved my achin' nose  
The biggest word you ever heard and this is how it goes  
Oh, supercalifragilisticexpialidocious  
Even though the sound of it is something quite atrocious  
If you say it loud enough you'll always sound precocious

Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay  
I've traveled all around the world and everywhere I went  
I'd use my word and all would say, ""There goes a clever gent""  
But when Dukes and maharajahs pass the time of day with me  
I say my special word and then they ask me out to tea  
Oh, supercalifragilisticexpialidocious  
Even though the sound of it is something quite atrocious  
If you say it loud enough you'll always sound precocious  
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious

A mule is an animal with long, funny ears  
He kicks up at anything he hears  
His back is brawny and his brain is weak  
He's just plain stupid with a stubborn streak  
And, by the way, if you hate to go to school  
You may grow up to be a mule

But then if that sort of life is what you wish  
You may grow up to be a fish

Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer

All of the other reindeer  
Used to laugh and call him names  
They never let poor Rudolph

Santa came to say

"I think I saw ol' santa through my window christmas eve  
My eyes were really droopy but I really do believe  
It must've been ol' santa 'cause I saw his big red hat  
And I know my mom and dad can't fly like that  
  
And then I heard some footsteps in the hall outside my door  
The same ol' christmas trick my dad had played since I was four  
He stands outside my bedroom yelling ""ho! ho! ho!"" because  
He knows I don't believe in santa claus  
  
I think my daddy sees me  
Peeking from my door  
But he pretends he's santa anyway  
Every year he tries to fool me  
But I'm a big boy now I don't believe in santa or his sleigh...  
No way!  
  
So I went back to bed and I curled up nice and tight  
I stared out my window and looked into the night  
And then, all of a sudden, through my window I could see  
Santa claus was flying by and smiling at me  
  
Chorus:  
Santa claus, santa claus  
It must've been ol' santa claus  
Santa claus, santa claus  
Happy ""ho! ho! ho!"" to you  
  
Then I heard ol' rudolph tellin' me to come outside  
He told me that ol' santa wanted me to take a ride  
I climbed out of my window and I jumped onto his sleigh  
Then ol' santa took me up up and away  
  
We flew high above the rooftops of my sleepy town below  
I saw my big red school house and the town square picture show  
It was really past my bedtime and so ol' santa said  
""little boys like you should be in bed""  
  
So I hollered ""ho! ho! ho!""  
And I put on santa's hat  
Then he let me hold the reins awhile  
We pulled up to my window  
And I jumped back in my room  
And I waved goodbye to santa with a smile  
  
When I woke up christmas morning it was clear and bright  
My parents said my window had blown open in the night  
I smiled as I told them that it must've been the cat  
And they asked me where I got my big red hat

They can choose their very own religion  
They can climb into bed in the

Sleep in your arms, as if hypnotized

To the land of what-might-have-been

When reality sets back in  
  
Blithe smile, lithe limb  
She who's winsome, she wins him  
Gold hair with a gentle curl  
That's the girl he chose  
And heaven knows  
I'm not that girl  
  
Don't wish don't start  
Wishing only wounds the heart  
I wasn't born for the rose and pearl  
There's a girl I know  
He loves her so  
I'm not that girl

"Down in Larissa's lagoon  
She sits by the light of the moon  
She's hearing voices in her head  
She must be strong  
She must not give in to their song  
She's hearing voices in her head  
  
Down in Larissa's lagoon  
Her guests, they sleep in separate rooms  
But her father comes to tuck her into bed  
She's lost her mind  
Got no control  
And there's nowhere else to go  
When her father comes to tuck her into bed  
  
[Chrous:]  
But Larissa woke up one morning singing,  
""Hallelujah, remember me for my passion,  
The paradise that I imagined, hallelujah.""  
  
Down in Larissa's lagoon  
The skies, they never look blue  
'Cause someone spiked the rain  
With a little extra juice  
She thinks she's being followed  
Any minute she'll be swallowed  
Someone spiked this rain  
With a little extra juice  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hallelujah... Hallelujah... Hallelujah... Hallelujah  
Down in Larissa's lagoon  
There is no force that's greater  
Looming deep within a very, very, very troubled girl  
She stays awake for hours  
Picking out the sweetest flowers  
To lay upon the grave of a very, very troubled girl

Let it go, let it go  
Turn away and slam the door

The cold never bothered me anyway  
  
It's funny how some distance makes everything seem small  
And the fears that once controlled me can't get to me at all  
It's time to see what I can do  
To test the limits and break through  
No right, no wrong, no rules for me  
I'm free  
  
Let it go, let it go  
I am one with the wind and sky  
Let it go, let it go  
You'll never see me cry  
Here I stand and here I stay  
Let the storm rage on  
  
My power flurries through the air into the ground  
My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around  
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast  
I'm never going back, the past is in the past  
  
Let it go, let it go and  
I'll rise like the break of dawn  
Let it go, let it go

"Now have you read of the fable of Cain and Abel?  
Once they were in a scandal that shook the town.  
Cain became mighty jealous of brother Abel,  
So he rose up and smote Abel down.  
  
Now the Lord sure was hopping mad,  
And yet he was plenty sad,  
to think that he had a man like Cain.  
  
The Lord spoke and showed his wrath,  
And Cain walked the path  
That led to a life full of pain.  
  
You can't run from the shadow of retribution.  
If you're bad then you gotta pay for your wrongs.  
Let yourself take a lesson from Cain and Able:  
  
Don't lament, be content,  
Don't resent what the Lord has sent,  
And you'll find that you're bound to get along.

Never lovers, ever friends  
  
Goodbye, let our hearts call it a day, but before you walk away

And then a kiss, but more than this, I wish you love  
  
And in July, a lemonade to cool you in some leafy glade  
I wish you health and more than wealth, I wish you love  
  
My breaking heart and I agree that you and I could never be  
So with my best, my very best, I set you free

Most of all, when snowflakes fall, I wish you love

Better face the facts, ol' buddy,  
And be prepared to take the blow.  
You don't have to sit and study,  
It's something anyone should know.  
Shake hands... get your hat...  
And go.  
  
You can praise her eyes,  
And adore her hair.  
But if love ain't there,  
It ain't there.  
  
And you can walk her home  
In the warm spring air,  
But if love ain't there,  
It ain't there.  
  
And you can look  
With a longing in your look,  
And try every method in the book  
And worship the smile that kind of  
Took you unaware.  
  
And you can weep and sigh,  
You can say, ""unfair"".  
You can almost die of despair.  
But if love ain't there,  
It ain't there.

When we're apart, the words in my heart  
Reveal how I feel about you  
Some kiss may cloud my memories  
And other arms may hold a thrill, yes yes yes  
But please do nothing till you hear it from me

"Frosty the snowman was a jolly happy soul,  
With a corncob pipe and a button nose  
And two eyes made out of coal.  
Frosty the snowman is a fairy tale, they say,  
He was made of snow but the children  
Know how he came to life one day.  
  
There must have been some magic in that  
Old silk hat they found.  
For when they placed it on his head  
He began to dance around.  
  
O, Frosty the snowman  
Was alive as he could be,  
And the children say he could laugh  
And play just the same as you and me.  
  
Thumpetty thump thump,  
Thumpety thump thump,  
Look at Frosty go.  
Thumpetty thump thump,  
Thumpety thump thump,  
Over the hills of snow.  
  
Frosty the snowman knew  
The sun was hot that day,  
So he said, ""Let's run and  
We'll have some fun  
Now before I melt away.""  
  
Down to the village,  
With a broomstick in his hand,  
Running here and there all  
Around the square saying,  
Catch me if you can.  
  
He led them down the streets of town  
Right to the traffic cop.  
And he only paused a moment when  
He heard him holler ""Stop!""  
  
For Frosty the snow man  
Had to hurry on his way,  
But he waved goodbye saying,  
""Don't you cry,  
I'll be back again some day.""  
  
Thumpetty thump thump,  
Thumpety thump thump,  
Look at Frosty go.

Starlit summer nights can hold a thousand new delights  
When you're with someone you love  
Every little flower seems to blossom by the hour  
With some rare perfume  
She can touch your hand and make a palace of a tiny room  
Happy things are gladder even sad things so much sadder  
When there's someone you love  
You can climb the ladder of romance  
And reach the stars above  
And when you've quarreled and vowed you would end it  
How sweet it is when you mend it  
You're just not you without  
Can't do without that someone you love

"I used to walk with you  
Along the avenue  
Our hearts were carefree and gay  
How could I know I'd lose you  
Somewhere along the way?  
  
The friends we used to know  
Would always smile ""Hello""  
No love like our love they'd say  
Then love slipped through our fingers  
Somewhere along the way  
  
I should forget  
But with the loneliness of night I start remembering ev'rything  
You're gone and yet  
There's still a feeling deep inside  
That you will always be part of me  
  
So now I look for you  
Along the avenue  
And as I wander I pray  
That some day soon I'll find you  
Somewhere along the way

Always reminding me that we're apart  
  
You wander down the lane and far away  
Leaving me a song that will not die  
Love is now the stardust of yesterday

The lonely night dreaming of a song  
The melody haunts my reverie

When our love was new  
And each kiss an inspiration  
But that was long ago  
Now my consolation  
Is in the stardust of a song  
  
Beside a garden wall  
When stars are bright  
You are in my arms

A paradise where roses bloom  
Though I dream in vain  
In my heart it will remain  
My stardust melody  
The memory of love's refrain

I won't give you no bail  
Shackled with chains of love  
I knew that I had bought, my own coffin nails  
I hear your sweet voice calling out my name  
As I stare from a six foot cell  
And from beyond I heard the words  
Deceptively yours

"[Verse 1]  
When I was a young girl  
My mama said to me  
Your daddy's leaving home today  
I think he's gone to stay  
We packed up all our bags  
And drove out to Winnipeg  
When we got to Winnipeg  
I checked in to school  
I wore white bucks on my feet  
When I learned the golden rule  
The punches came fast and hard  
Lying on my back in the school yard  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't be denied, don't be denied  
Don't be denied, don't be denied  
Don't be denied, don't be denied  
[Verse 2]  
Well pretty soon I met a friend  
He played guitar  
We used to sit on the steps at school  
And dream of being stars  
We started a band  
We played all night  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't be denied, don't be denied  
Don't be denied, don't be denied  
Don't be denied, don't be denied  
  
[Verse 3]  
Oh Canada  
We played all night  
I really hate to leave you now  
But to stay just wouldn't be right  
Down in Hollywood  
We played so good  
The businessmen crowded around  
They came to hear the golden sound  
There we were on the Sunset Strip  
Playing our songs for the highest bid  
We played all night  
The price was right  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't be denied, don't be denied  
Don't be denied, don't be denied  
Don't be denied, don't be denied  
  
[Verse 4]  
Well, all that glitters isn't gold  
I know you've heard that story told  
And I'm a pauper in a naked disguise  
A millionaire through a business man's eyes  
Oh friend of mine  
Don't be denied

Blurs any ties to the beginning

Watch the time go right out the window  
Trying to hold on but you didn't even know

It all fell apart  
What it meant to be will eventually be a memory of a time

It doesn't even matter how hard you try  
Keep that in mind as I designed this rhyme

In spite of the way you were mocking me  
Actin like I was part of your property  
Remembering all the times you've fought with me  
I'm surpirsed it got so far  
Things arent the way they were before  
You wouldnt even recognize me anymore  
Not that you knew me back then but it all comes back to me in the end

He was only 25  
Had an open heart and tender mind  
He sang through all the hymns he knew  
He was searching for a higher sign  
When his water was turned to wine  
All the darkness became light  
Babies and a patient wife  
They just weren't enough to keep him high  
So he gave them up  
Just to fill his cup  
Every sip would make him feel alive  
No bones in his body were dry

Singing Hallelujah till he drowns

"Wake up in the morining with nothing to do  
Gotta start the day off with a case of brew  
Hit the street at noon with beer stinkin breath  
Go down to the river with a 20 pack of green death  
Liquored up and pissed off on a saturday  
Night if the beer runs out theres gonna have to be a fight  
Scrounging for change just to buy a half rack  
Well I guess it beats smoking crack  
Its quantity not quality that counts  
Its best when its served in mass amounts  
Rather spend the evening getting drunk  
Than getting laid beer brigade  
Falling down shit faced totally drunk  
Stupid dirtyminded fucking river rat punx  
Sitting around sluggin down the malt liqour  
Listening to gg and trying to be sicker  
Drinkin to get drunk who cares about taste  
Pop a pigs eye and pour it in your face  
Drinkin to remember just drinkin too forget  
Drinkin cause we just don't give a shit

Last call has come and gone for us  
Down at our favorite bar.  
We got more beer at home but  
We can't walk 'cause' its too far  
Got a brand new set of wheel, and  
It's parked right out in the back  
It's called the DRUNK TANK  
And it's hell on tracks!  
We're having trouble walking  
So I guess we better drive.  
Don't even have to worry  
If we'll make it home alive.  
With twenty-seven tons  
Of fine carbon steel,  
It doesn't matter if you're fucked up  
When you get behind the wheel!  
Lock and load get on the road,  
In the Drunk Tank!  
Grinding gears and pounding beers,  
In the Drunk Tank!  
Inebriated, Amout plated,  
In the Drunk Tank!  
Drive and swill and shoot to kill,  
In the Drunk Tank!  
Set off to the bar  
With happy hour in out sights.  
Several hours later  
We'll be blacked out in a fire fight.  
Cut off by the bartender  
We'll drive right through the door  
With a cannon pointed at his head  
I bet he'll serve some more  
Flashing reds behind us  
But we won't pull to the side  
Swivel 'round the turret  
Johnny-law had better hide  
Let loose with the machine gun,  
Watch his car disintegrate.  
Now he's writing tickets  
From the wrong side of hell's gates  
Lock and load get on the road,  
In the Drunk Tank!  
Grinding gears and pounding beers,

Kill yourself, Kill yourself, Kill yourself  
Death might be fun why don't you try and see  
Kill yourself, Kill yourself, Kill yourself  
Just put us all out of your misery

Maybe Kavorkian can help

Death might improve your attitude

I filled em' all full of 9mm bullet holes  
Murder at the senior prom  
Mass murder at the senior prom x2  
I padlocked the gym doors the night of the senior prom  
Under the bleachers I planted several pipe bombs  
Stood up on the balcony sub-machine gun in my hand  
Said ""I'm your new prom king, does everybody understand?""  
Rounded up all the jocks who used to chase me home from school  
Tied their hands and feet and pushed them in the swimming pool  
Lined all the teachers who flunked me up against a wall  
Then one by one I stuck a butcher knife into them all  
Found that little fuck who got me busted for smokin' dope  
Now he's hanging from the flag pole kicking at the end of a rope  
Last but certainly not least when everybody else was dead  
I sodomized the cheerleaders and then I cut off all their heads

Bring a healthy appetite and a liter or a case.

Is the walkin' slab of bacon that tried shutting us down.  
Now he's basted in beer and turning golden brown

We were drinking out in the sun,  
When this boar in blue showed up to try and spoil our fun  
Started out front as a diversion tactic,  
While the rest of the guys went up to the attic,  
Opened up the window and jumped down on his head,  
And they beat him with forty-ouncers till he was dead

He's been turning on the rotisserie all day.  
Well it looks like the piggy couldn't stand the heat  
Now he's just pork, the other white meat  
Tenderize him with his own night stick,  
And cut him into pork-chops juicy and thick
