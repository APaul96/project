[]   Oh, I believe there are Angels Among Us,   Sent down to us from somewhere up above.   They come to you and me in our darkest hours   To show us how to live   To teach us how to give   To guide us with a light of love.      When life held troubled times   And had me down on my knees   There's always been someone   To come along and comfort me   A kind word from a stranger   To lend a helping hand   A phone call from a friend   Just to say I understand   Now ain't it kind of funny   At the dark end of the road   Someone light the way with just a single ray of hope.      []      They wear so many faces,   Show up in the strangest places   And grace us with their mercies in our time of need.      []      To guide us with a light of love  \""
