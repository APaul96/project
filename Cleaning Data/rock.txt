"On the first part of the journey  
I was looking at all the life  
There were plants and birds and rocks and things  
There was sand and hills and rings  
The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz  
And the sky with no clouds  
The heat was hot and the ground was dry  
But the air was full of sound  
  
I've been through the desert on a horse with no name  
It felt good to be out of the rain  
In the desert you can remember your name  
Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain  
La, la  
  
After two days in the desert sun  
My skin began to turn red  
After three days in the desert fun  
I was looking at a river bed  
And the story it told of a river that flowed  
Made me sad to think it was dead  
  
You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name  
It felt good to be out of the rain  
In the desert you can remember your name  
Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain  
La, la  
  
After nine days I let the horse run free  
Cause the desert had turned to sea  
There were plants and birds and rocks and things  
There was sand and hills and rings  
The ocean is a desert with it's life underground  
And a perfect disguise above  
Under the cities lies a heart made of ground  
But the humans will give no love  
  
You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name

When I called you from my river of darkness  
An echo was all that came back  
I saw you wave goodbye  
Down the railroad track  
Sometimes when you're out and all alone  
And you can't find your way back  
Wonder if we'll ever make it home

The time just disappear  
  
Feelin' you here again  
Hot on my skin again  
Feelin' good, a thing

Millions of dreams come real?  
A feelin' in my soul  
I'd never felt before  
  
And you, you always told me  
No matter how long it holds me  
If it falls apart  
Or makes us millionaires

We'll go through this thing together  
And on Heaven's golden shore  
We'll lay our heads

"Frosty the snowman  
Was a jolly happy soul  
With a corn-cob pipe  
And a button nose  
And two eyes made out of coal  
Frosty the snowman  
Is a fairy tale they say  
He was made of snow  
But the children know  
How he came to life one day  
There must have been some magic  
In that old silk hat they found  
For when they placed it on his head  
He began to dance around  
Frosty the snowman  
Was alive as he could be  
And the children say  
He could laugh and play  
Just the same as you and me  
Frosty the snowman  
Knew the sun was hot that day  
So he said, ""Let's run  
And we'll have some fun  
Now before I melt away""  
Down to the village  
With a broomstick in his hand  
Running here and there  
All around the square  
Saying, ""Catch me if you can""  
He led them down the streets of town  
Right to the traffic cop  
He only paused a moment when  
He heard them holler, stop  
Frosty the snowman  
Had to hurry on his way  
But he waved goodbye  
Saying, ""Don't you cry  
I'll be back again some day""  
(Frosty)  
Yes, he waved goodbye  
Saying, ""Don't you cry  
I'll be back again some day""

Smell the perfume of the silent dream  
Fly the ocean, read a story to me  
Speak the wisdom of a redwood tree  
Speak to me  
  
So you think that star cluster shining bright in the sky  
Will speak the fate of your evening, tell the truth to your lie  
Don't let the features you read control the tickets you buy  
Soon as you learn that you live, you're just beginning to die

Little James became a working man  
He followed his pa right across the land  
At the end of the day when his work was done  
He'd sit and watch the setting southern sun  
  
Nineteen years had come and gone  
Little Jimmy had grown up big and strong  
He didn't know that his time had come  
When they handed him a shiny black gun  
  
So his pa said, run, run, run, run, run, run (Jim you gotta get away)

Hidden in some secret place  
Etched in lines around my face  
The ghosts in here are all competing  
Over one more song about love and leaving

Down, down we all fall down  
Down, down we all fall down

Til you find it's only hollow  
I can hear the angels grieving

"I hear a car, I hope it's yours  
I hear the phone, I hope it's you  
It seems I spend most half my life waiting  
For the things I'll never do  
When you were here, in love with me  
There was so much (so much, so much) I couldn't see  
And I watched you home believing  
That you would never leave  
Now I can't stand to be without you  
I'm burning for one more kiss  
I dream every night about you  
Sometimes I'm on target, sometimes I seem to miss you  
Night after night I lie awake  
Wond'ring how long it's gonna take  
Till I hold you close beside me  
And share the love we make  
'Cause I can't stand to be without you  
I can't take much more of this  
I dream every night about you  
Sometimes I'm on target, sometimes I seem to miss you  
Ah, oh baby turn your heart around  
Ah, (oo) baby turn your heart around  
Di, di, di, di, di, di  
Ah, (come back, da, da, da) baby turn your heart around (oh)

One chance  
For a true love  
If a heart breaks,  
Does it break forever?  
There'll be no more,  
Though you want back together  
  
You soon will start running baby,  
I know you will.  
Though I've seen it coming lately,  
I love you still.  
How long must I keep on trying  
To change your mind?  
How long till there's no denying  
We're out of time?  
  
Is there really just,  
One chance  
At a true love  
If a heart breaks,  
Does it break forever?  
There'll be no more,  
Though you want back together.  
  
Is there really just,  
One chance  
At a new start  
But just one glance  
Tells you it doesn't matter  
So you turn 'round so you  
Don't have to face it.  
  
Where are you goin' baby?  
Where have you been?  
I don't even know you lately,  
Let me back in.  
I guess I'll just keep on waiting,  
It's all I can do.  
Feels like the future's fadin' into the blue.  
  
Is there really just,  
One chance  
At a true love  
If a heart breaks  
Does it break forever?  
There'll be no more

Chasin' the prince of alibis  
Into a smokescreen made of lies

Bringing peace to all  
Darkness there together  
Soft light bells and tea, draw the curtain  
China cups, some shatter for certain

Grey morning will never divide us

Of the footsteps alone

And the sun was a demon  
The clouds were afraid, 110 in the shade  
And the pavements were steaming  
  
I told Billy Ray in his red Chevrolet  
I needed time for some thinking  
I was just walkin' by when I looked in her eye  
And I swore it was winkin'  
  
She was thirty-one and I was seventeen  
I knew nothin' 'bout love, she knew everything  
But I sat down beside her on a front porch swing  
And wondered what the coming night would bring  
  
The sun closed her eyes as it climbed in the sky  
And it started to swelter  
Sweat trickled down the front of her gown  
And I thought it would melt her  
  
She threw back her hair like I wasn't there  
And she sipped on a Julep  
Her shoulders were bare and I tried not to stare  
When I looked at her two lips  
  
And then she looked at me, I heard her softly say  
I know you're young, you don't know what to do or say  
But stay with me until the sun has gone away  
And I will chase the boy in you away  
  
And then she smiled and we talked for a while  
Then we walked for a mile to the sea  
We sat on the sand and a boy took her hand  
But I saw the sunrise as a man  
  
Ten years have gone by since I looked in her eye  
But the memory lingers  
I go back in my mind to the very first time  
And feel the touch of her fingers

I can't forget how two hearts met breathlessly.  
Your arms opened wide and closed me inside.  
You took my lips, you took my love so tenderly.

Maybe you won't understand

But I can't forget the woman  
She was always Christie Lee  
He was working in a night club  
That's where he played the saxophone  
He used to fake to stock arrangements  
He left the customers alone  
But one night before the last song  
About a quarter after three  
He saw her standing at the coat check  
And made his move on Christie Lee  
Christie Lee, Christie Lee  
Christie Lee, Christie Lee  
She was a nice piece of music  
She had a rhythm all her own  
He blew a solo like a blind man  
She really dug his saxophone  
She wanted more than just an encore  
And he could play in every key  
He left the stage and packed his alto  
And took it home with Christie Lee  
Oh I heard the man knew ""the Bird"" like the Bible  
You know the man could blow an educated axe  
He couldn't see that Christie Lee was a woman  
Who didn't need another lover  
All she wanted was the sax  
It took a while for him to notice  
It took a while for him to see  
He was never in control here  
It was always Christie Lee  
Christie Lee, Christie Lee  
Christie Lee, Christie Lee  
Oh the man took a calculated gamble  
Yes the man had the power to perform  
But Christie Lee was more than he knew how to handle  
She didn't need him as a man  
All she wanted was the horn  
They say that Joe became a wino  
They say he always drinks alone  
They say he stumbles like a blind man  
They say he sold his saxophone  
Even the band must face the music  
That's what the moral is to me  
The only time you hit the high note  
Is when you play for Christie Lee

Those Scandinavian skies  
The landing gear came down  
And touched the Swedish ground  
And we were all so paralyzed

We were mainly sound and lights  
In the veins

We had the Midas touch  
Until we met the Dutch  
And they exhausted our supplies

For this international flight  
Who could stay  
We were only there for the night  
We watched the power fall  
Inside the Olso hall  
While all the cold Norweigians cried  
Who could say  
What was left and where was right?

Now we are forced to recognize our inhumanity  
Our reason coexists with our insanity

Uptown girl  
You know I can't afford to buy her pearls  
But maybe someday when my ship comes in  
She'll understand what kind of guy I've been  
And then I'll win

She's looking so fine  
And when she's talking  
She'll say that she's mine  
  
She'll say I'm not so tough

I'm in love

And now she's looking for a downtown man

Never thought I'd do before

"Some love is just a lie of the heart

This time you've got nothing to lose  
You can take it, you can leave it  
Whatever you choose  
I won't hold back anything  
And I'll walk away a fool or a king  
Some love is just a lie of the mind  
It's make believe until its only a matter of time  
And some might have learned to adjust  
But then it never was a matter of trust  
  
I'm sure you're aware love  
We've both had our share of  
Believing too long  
When the whole situation was wrong  
  
Some love is just a lie of the soul  
A constant battle for the ultimate state of control  
After you've heard lie upon lie

Because it's always been a matter of trust

Everyone is so untrue.  
Honesty is hardly ever heard.

I can have security until the bitter end.  
Anyone can comfort me  
With promises again.  
I know, I know.  
  
When I'm deep inside of me  
Don't be too concerned.  
I won't ask for nothin' while I'm gone.  
But when I want sincerity  
Tell me where else can I turn.  
Because you're the one that I depend upon.

Kind of life.""

Pile carpet  
And a couple of paintings from Sears  
A big waterbed that they bought  
With the bread  
They had saved for a couple  
Of years  
They started to fight when the  
Money got tight  
And they just didn't count on  
The tears.  
  
They lived for a while in a  
Very nice style  
But it's always the same in the end  
They got a divorce as a matter  
Of course  
And they parted the closest  
Of friends  
Then the king and the queen went  
Back to the green  
But you can never go back  
There again.  
  
Brenda and Eddie had had it  
Already by the summer of '75  
From the high to the low to  
The end of the show  
For the rest of their lives  
They couldn't go back to  
The greasers  
The best they could do was  
Pick up the pieces  
We always knew they would both  
Find a way to get by  
That's all I heard about  
Brenda and Eddie  
Can't tell you more than I  
Told you already  
And here we are wavin' Brenda  
And Eddie goodbye.

Now with the wisdom of years I try to reason things out  
And the only people I fear are those who never have doubts  
Save us all from arrogant men, and all the causes they're for  
I won't be righteous again  
I'm not that sure anymore  
  
Shades of grey are all that I find  
When I look to the enemy line  
There ain't no rainbows shining on me

The more I find out the less that I know  
There ain't no rainbows shining on me  
Shades of grey are the colors I see

I'd do anything at all

I could walk away from anyone I ever knew

"Sometimes i wish  
  
I know that this question raises all kinds of issues  
in my mind, and this question is do you believe  
in Christ? Because i believe that what we expierence  
and ah and its not being talked about openly enough  
was pure evil.  
  
Sometimes i wish this world was just a crazy  
dream, sometimes things arent what they are meant  
to be, or what they seem.  
  
Sometimes i wish this world was one big dream  
so many tragedies, life threatning disease in  
reality who can we blame for these things? So  
we pray for the families and the souls of the  
people shot dead they cry, roaming through the  
halls of the schools at night. My homie  
Joseph in Texas, 14 years old police took his  
life at his front door. Maybe humans have  
converted into a beast. Can we really point  
the finger at just one thing? Is it a sign  
of the time or just the beginning i pray  
to God to help me keep living. Jealousy  
and envy and so much hate, newborn babies  
thrown in garbage cans every day.  
In the lobby of a hospital a young girl dies, no  
money to pay so she pays with her life.  
  
Chorus  
  
How many times must we ask ourselves why,  
and how many times must we watch our children die?  
Remember the times we were united as one growing  
up as a child life was always fun. Time have  
changed and its been for the worst. Trials and  
tribulations that we face of course, time to put  
our foot down lets get to know our young ones  
before the next tragedy becomes the realest one.  
1999 this year is half was over. Lessons not learned,  
how your learning i couldve told ya. Maybe this  
happened for a reason only the Lord knows why. And  
this is for us to open up our eyes cause death awaits  
us at any given time. My love goes out to those  
whos souls rest tonight, and all we can do is just  
ask ourselves why? Wish this wouldnt be all we can  
do is pray and cry.  
  
Chorus  
  
Things change for the wrong we cant go on this long.  
Hand in hand right by your side, i love it then  
and no more cry so if i was to go to tonight, ill  
pray that youll be alright. One Lord one might rejoice,  
one soul unite one voice.  
  
Pray for all of us, Father let us not take  
things for granted, and please let us count  
each and every one of our blessings Father.  
  
Now generation X is what they call it whys that?  
Is it because this is where it all ends at, to  
go to war we dont need to be over seas. Its been  
declared out in the streets, gangs, thugs,  
moving drugs, government officials, blackmarket,  
military guns.  
Is this why you gave us the right to bare arms? To  
hit armagedon head on? Read between the lines its  
Genesise, and now the youth just dont smoke weed,  
they got things like man made methaphetamines  
never letting the young souls dream. And whats  
to do? When our youth is being mentally,  
physically, sexually abused. How do we change  
when its all put in our brains, money, sex,  
power, the year 2K. And everyday i watch  
the news it shows me how  
close we are to Judgement day, and  
so for its all worth i Pray.

"Well I'm on the Downeaster ""Alexa""  
And I'm cruising through Block Island Sound,  
I have charted a course to the Vineyard  
But tonight I am Nantucket bound.  
We took on diesel back in Montauk yesterday  
Left this morning from the bell in Gardiners Bay,  
Like all the locals here I had to sell my home  
Too proud to leave I worked my fingers to the bone.  
So I could own my Downeaster ""Alexa""  
And I go where the ocean is deep  
There are giants out there in the canyon  
And a good captain can't fall asleep.  
I got bills to pay and children who need clothes  
I know there's fish out there but God only knows,  
They say these waters aren't what they used to be  
But I got people back on land who count on me.  
So if you see my Downeaster ""Alexa""  
And if you work with the rod and the reel,  
Tell my wife I am trolling Atlantis  
And I still have my hands on the wheel.  
Now I drive my Downeaster ""Alexa""  
More and more miles from shore every year  
Since they told me I can't sell no stripers  
And there's no luck in swordfishing here  
I was a bayman like my father was before  
Can't make a living as a bayman anymore,  
There ain't much future for a man who works the sea  
But there ain't no island left for islanders like me.

"My name is Donald White, you see,  
I stand before you all.  
I was judged by you a murderer  
And the hangman's knot must fall.  
I will die upon the gallows pole  
When the moon is shining clear,  
And these are my final words  
That you will ever hear.  
  
I left my home in Kansas  
When I was very young,  
I landed in the old Northwest,  
Seattle, Washington  
Although I'd a-traveled many miles,  
I never made a friend,  
For I could never get along in life  
With people that I met.  
  
If I had some education  
To give me a decent start,  
I might have been a doctor or  
A master in the arts.  
But I used my hands for stealing  
When I was very young,  
And they locked me down in jailhouse cells,  
That's how my life begun.  
  
Oh, the inmates and the prisoners,  
I found they were my kind,  
And it was there inside the bars  
I found my peace of mind.  
But the jails they were too crowded,  
Institutions overflowed,  
So they turned me loose to walk upon  
Life's hurried tangled road.  
  
And there's danger on the ocean  
Where the salt sea waves split high,  
And there's danger on the battlefield  
Where the shells of bullets fly,  
And there's danger in this open world  
Where men strive to be free,  
And for me the greatest danger  
Was in society.  
  
So I asked them to send me back  
To the institution home.  
But they said they were too crowded,  
For me they had no room.  
I got down on my knees and begged,  
""Oh, please put me away,""  
But they would not listen to my plea  
Or nothing I would say.  
  
And so it was on Christmas eve  
In the year of '59,  
It was on that night I killed a man,  
I did not try to hide,  
The jury found me guilty  
And I won't disagree,  
For I knew that it would happen  
If I wasn't put away.  
  
And I'm glad I've had no parents  
To care for me or cry,  
For now they will never know  
The horrible death I die.  
And I'm also glad I've had no friends  
To see me in disgrace,  
For they'll never see that hangman's hood  
Wrap around my face.  
  
Farewell unto the old north woods  
Of which I used to roam,  
Farewell unto the crowded bars  
Of which've been my home,  
Farewell to all you people  
Who think the worst of me,  
I guess you'll feel much better when  
I'm on that hanging tree.  
  
But there's just one question  
Before they kill me dead,  
I'm wondering just how much  
To you I really said  
Concerning all the boys that come  
Down a road like me,  
Are they enemies or victims  
Of your society?

I'll build my world around you  
  
Beyond the horizon, at the end of the game  
Every step that you take, I'm walking the same  
  
Beyond the horizon the night winds blow  
The theme of a melody from many moons ago  
The bells of St. Mary, how sweetly they chime  
Beyond the horizon I found you just in time  
  
It's dark and it's dreary  
I ponder in vain  
I'm weakened, I'm weary  
My repentance is plain  
  
Beyond the horizon o'er the treacherous sea  
I still can't believe that you've set aside your love for me  
  
Beyond the horizon, 'neath crimson skies  
In the soft light of morning I'll follow you with my eyes  
Through countries and kingdoms and temples of stone  
Beyond the horizon right down to the bone  
  
It's late in the season  
Never knew, never cared  
Whatever the reason  
Someone's life has been spared  
  
Beyond the horizon the sky is so blue  
I've got more than a lifetime to live lovin' you

"While riding on a train goin' west,  
I fell asleep for to take my rest.  
I dreamed a dream that made me sad,  
Concerning myself and the first few friends I had.  
  
With half-damp eyes I stared to the room  
Where my friends and I spent many an afternoon,  
Where we together weathered many a storm,  
Laughin' and singin' till the early hours of the morn.  
  
By the old wooden stove where our hats was hung,  
Our words were told, our songs were sung,  
Where we longed for nothin' and were quite satisfied  
Talkin' and a-jokin' about the world outside.  
  
With haunted hearts through the heat and cold,  
We never thought we could ever get old.  
We thought we could sit forever in fun  
But our chances really was a million to one.  
  
As easy it was to tell black from white,  
It was all that easy to tell wrong from right.  
And our choices were few and the thought never hit  
That the one road we traveled would ever shatter and split.  
  
How many a year has passed and gone,  
And many a gamble has been lost and won,  
And many a road taken by many a friend,  
And each one I've never seen again.  
  
I wish, I wish, I wish in vain,  
That we could sit simply in that room again.  
Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat,  
I'd give it all gladly if our lives could be like that.

"By Bob Dylan  
  
I was sittin' on a stump  
Down in New Orleans,  
I was feelin' kinda low down,  
Dirty and mean.  
Along came a fella  
And he didn't even ask.  
He says, ""I know of a woman  
That can fix you up fast. ""  
I didn't think twice,  
I said like I should,  
""Let's go find this lady  
That can do me some good. ""  
We walked across the river  
On a sailin' spree  
And we came to a door  
Called one-oh-three.  
  
I was just about ready  
To give it a little knock  
When out comes a fella  
Who couldn't even walk.  
He's linkin' and a-slinkin',  
Couldn't stand on his feet,  
And he moaned and he groaned  
And he shuffled down the street.  
Well, out of the door  
There comes another man.  
He wiggled and he wobbled,  
He couldn't hardly stand.  
He had this frightened  
Look in his eyes,  
Like he just fought a bear,  
He was ready to die.  
  
Well, I peeked through the key crack,  
Comin' down the hall  
Was a long-legged man  
Who couldn't hardly crawl.  
He muttered and he uttered  
In broken French,  
And he looked like he'd been through  
A monkey wrench.  
  
Well, by this time  
I was a-scared to knock,  
I was a-scared to move,  
I's in a state of shock.  
I hummed a little tune  
And I shuffled my feet  
And I started walkin' backwards  
Down that broad street.  
Well, I got to the corner,  
I tried my best to smile.  
I turned around the corner  
And I ran a bloody mile.  
Man, I wasn't runnin'  
'Cause I was sick,  
I was just a-runnin'  
To get out of there quick.  
  
Well, I tripped right along  
And I'm a-wheezin' in my chest.

In a minute or less.

With a one-arm jump.

Louisiana way,  
And you feel kinda lonesome  
And you need a place to stay,

"Far between sundown's finish an' midnight's broken toll

As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds  
Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing  
Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight  
Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight  
An' for each an' ev'ry underdog soldier in the night  
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.  
  
In the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched  
With faces hidden while the walls were tightening  
As the echo of the wedding bells before the blowin' rain  
Dissolved into the bells of the lightning  
Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake  
Tolling for the luckless, the abandoned an' forsakened  
Tolling for the outcast, burnin' constantly at stake  
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.  
  
Through the mad mystic hammering of the wild ripping hail  
The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder  
That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze  
Leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder  
Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind  
Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind  
An' the unpawned painter behind beyond his rightful time  
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.  
  
Through the wild cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales  
For the disrobed faceless forms of no position  
Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts  
All down in taken-for-granted situations  
Tolling for the deaf an' blind, tolling for the mute  
Tolling for the mistreated, mateless mother, the mistitled prostitute  
For the misdemeanor outlaw, chased an' cheated by pursuit  
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.  
  
Even though a cloud's white curtain in a far-off corner flashed  
An' the hypnotic splattered mist was slowly lifting  
Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones  
Condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting  
Tolling for the searching ones, on their speechless, seeking trail  
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale  
An' for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail  
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.  
  
Starry-eyed an' laughing as I recall when we were caught  
Trapped by no track of hours for they hanged suspended  
As we listened one last time an' we watched with one last look  
Spellbound an' swallowed 'til the tolling ended  
Tolling for the aching ones whose wounds cannot be nursed  
For the countless confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones an' worse  
An' for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe  
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.

Yes, I cried for you - now it's your turn, you can cry awhile  
  
Well, there's preachers in the pulpits and babies in the cribs  
I'm longin' for that sweet fat that sticks to your ribs  
I'm gonna buy me a barrel of whiskey - I'll die before I turn senile  
Well, I cried for you - now it's your turn, you can cry awhile  
  
Well, you bet on a horse and it ran on the wrong way

I might need a good lawyer, could be your funeral, my trial

"Oh, the gentlemen are talking and the midnight moon is on the riverside  
They're drinking up and walking and it is time for me to slide  
I live in another world where life and death are memorized  
Where the earth is strung with lover's pearls and all I see are dark eyes.  
  
A cock is crowing far away and another soldier's deep in prayer  
Some mother's child has gone astray, she can't find him anywhere  
But I hear another rum beating for the dead that rise  
Whom nature's beast fear as they come and all I see are dark eyes.  
  
They tell me to be discreet for all intended purposes  
They tell me revenge is sweet, I'm sure it is  
But I feel nothing for their game, where beauty goes unrecognized  
All I feel is heat and flame, and all I see are dark eyes.  
  
Oh, the French girl, she's in paradise and a drunken man is at the wheel  
Hunger pays a heavy prize to the falling god of speed and steel  
Oh, time is short and the days are sweet and passion rules the arrow that
flies  
A million faces at my feet but all I see are dark eyes.

Dependin' on the way you feel that you live.  
  
Dear landlord,  
Please heed these words that I speak.  
I know you've suffered much,  
But in this you are not so unique.  
All of us, at times, we might work too hard  
To have it too fast and too much,  
And anyone can fill his life up  
With things he can see but he just cannot touch.  
  
Dear landlord,  
Please don't dismiss my case.  
I'm not about to argue,  
I'm not about to move to no other place.

And if you don't underestimate me,  
I won't underestimate you.

Through the clear county lakes and the lumberjack lands,  
We're following them dusty old fairgrounds a-calling.

Through the cow country towns and the sands of old Montana.

I've gazed from the trailer window laughing.  
Oh, our clothes they was torn but the colors they was bright.  
Following them dusty old fairgrounds a-calling.

The jugglers, the hustlers, the gamblers.

Oh, it's pound down the rails and it's tie down the tents,  
Get that canvas flag a-flying.  
Well, let the caterpillars spin, let the ferris wheel wind

Well, it's roll into town straight to the fairgrounds  
Just behind the posters that are hanging

Get the dancing girls in front, get the gambling show behind,  
Hear that old music box a-banging.  
Hear them kids, faces, smiles, up and down the midway aisles  
We're following them fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
It's a-drag it on down by the deadline in the town,  
Hit the old highway by the morning  
And it's ride yourself blind for the next town on time  
Following them fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
As the harmonicas whined in the lonesome nighttime  
Drinking red wine as we're rolling,  
Many a turnin' I turn, many a lesson I learn  
From following them fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
And it's roll back down to St. Petersburg  
Tie down the trailers and camp 'em  
And the money that we made will pay for the space  
From following them dusty old fairgrounds a-calling.

The wounded flowers were dangling from the vine  
I was passing by yon cool crystal fountain  
Someone hit me from behind  
  
Ain't talkin', just walkin'  
Through this weary world of woe  
Heart burnin', still yearnin'  
No one on earth would ever know  
  
They say prayer has the power to heal  
So pray from the mother  
In the human heart an evil spirit can dwell  
I am a-tryin' to love my neighbor and do good unto others  
But oh, mother, things ain't going well  
  
Ain't talkin', just walkin'  
I'll burn that bridge before you can cross  
Heart burnin', still yearnin'  
There'll be no mercy for you once you've lost  
  
Now I'm all worn down by weeping  
My eyes are filled with tears, my lips are dry  
If I catch my opponents ever sleeping  
I'll just slaughter 'em where they lie  
  
Ain't talkin', just walkin'  
Through the world mysterious and vague  
Heart burnin', still yearnin'  
Walkin' through the cities of the plague.  
  
Well, the whole world is filled with speculation  
The whole wide world which people say is round  
They will tear your mind away from contemplation  
They will jump on your misfortune when you're down  
  
Ain't talkin', just walkin'  
Eatin' hog eyed grease in a hog eyed town.  
Heart burnin', still yearnin'  
Some day you'll be glad to have me around.  
  
They will crush you with wealth and power  
Every waking moment you could crack  
I'll make the most of one last extra hour  
I'll revenge my father's death then I'll step back  
  
Ain't talkin', just walkin'  
Hand me down my walkin' cane.  
Heart burnin', still yearnin'  
Got to get you out of my miserable brain.  
  
All my loyal and my much-loved companions  
They approve of me and share my code  
I practice a faith that's been long abandoned  
Ain't no altars on this long and lonesome road  
  
Ain't talkin', just walkin'  
My mule is sick, my horse is blind.  
Heart burnin', still yearnin'  
Thinkin' 'bout that gal I left behind.  
  
Well, it's bright in the heavens and the wheels are flyin'  
Fame and honor never seem to fade  
The fire gone out but the light is never dyin'  
Who says I can't get heavenly aid?  
  
Ain't talkin', just walkin'  
Carryin' a dead man's shield  
Heart burnin', still yearnin'  
Walkin' with a toothache in my heel  
  
The sufferin' is unending  
Every nook and cranny has its tears  
I'm not playing, I'm not pretending  
I'm not nursin' any superfluous fears  
  
Ain't talkin', just walkin'  
Walkin' ever since the other night.  
Heart burnin', still yearnin'  
Walkin' 'til I'm clean out of sight.  
  
As I walked out in the mystic garden  
On a hot summer day, a hot summer lawn  
Excuse me, ma'am, I beg your pardon  
There's no one here, the gardener is gone  
  
Ain't talkin', just walkin'  
Up the road, around the bend.  
Heart burnin', still yearnin'  
In the last outback at the world's end.

"""There must be some way out of here,"" said the joker to the thief,  
""There's too much confusion, I can't get no relief.  
Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth,  
None of them along the line know what any of it is worth.""  
  
""No reason to get excited,"" the thief, he kindly spoke,  
""There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke.  
But you and I, we've been through that, and this is not our fate,  
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late.""  
  
All along the watchtower, princes kept the view  
While all the women came and went, barefoot servants, too.  
  
Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl,  
Two riders were approaching, the wind began to howl.

"Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,  
As we went a-walkin' down by the seaside,  
Mark now what followed and what did betide,  
For it bein' on Christmas mornin'  
Now, for recreation, we went on a tramp,  
And we met Sergeant Napper and Corporal Vamp  
And a little wee drummer intending to camp,  
For the day bein' pleasant and charmin'.  
  
""Good morning, good morning,"" the Sergeant he cried.  
""And the same to you, gentlemen,"" we did reply,  
Intending no harm but meant to pass by,  
For it bein' on Christmas mornin'  
""But,"" says he, ""My fine fellows, if you will enlist,  
Ten guineas in gold I'll stick to your fist,  
And a crown in the bargain for to kick up the dust,  
And drink the king's health in the morning.  
  
""For a soldier, he leads a very fine life,  
And he always is blessed with a charming young wife,  
And he pays all his debts without sorrow or strife,  
And he always lives pleasant and charmin',  
And a soldier, he always is decent and clean,  
In the finest of clothing he's constantly seen.  
While other poor fellows go dirty and mean,  
And sup on thin gruel in the morning.""  
  
""But,"" says Arthur, ""I wouldn't be proud of your clothes,  
For you've only the lend of them, as I suppose,  
But you dare not change them one night, for you know  
If you do, you'll be flogged in the morning,  
And although that we're single and free,  
We take great delight in our own company,  
We have no desire strange places to see,  
Although that your offers are charming.  
  
""And we have no desire to take your advance,  
All hazards and dangers we barter on chance,  
For you'd have no scruples for to send us to France,  
Where we would get shot without warning,""  
""Oh no,"" says the Sergeant. ""I'll have no such chat,  
And neither will I take it from snappy young brats,  
For if you insult me with one other word,  
I'll cut off your heads in the morning.""  
  
And Arthur and I, we soon drew our hogs,  
And we scarce gave them time to draw their own blades  
When a trusty shillelagh came over their head  
And bid them take that as fair warning.  
And their old rusty rapiers that hung by their sides,  
We flung them as far as we could in the tide,  
""Now take them up, devils!"" cried Arthur McBride,  
""And temper their edge in the mornin'!""  
  
And the little wee drummer, we flattened his bow,  
And we made a football of his rowdy-dow-dow,  
Threw it in the tide for to rock and to roll,  
And bade it a tedious returning,  
And we havin' no money, paid them off in cracks.  
We paid no respect to their two bloody backs,  
And we lathered them there like a pair of wet sacks,  
And left them for dead in the morning.  
  
And so, to conclude and to finish disputes,  
We obligingly asked if they wanted recruits,  
For we were the lads who would give them hard clouts  
And bid them look sharp in the mornin'.

As we went a-walkin' down by the seaside,  
Mark now what followed and what did betide,

To breathe the air around Tom Paine's,  
I spied the fairest damsel  
That ever did walk in chains.  
I offer'd her my hand,  
She took me by the arm.  
I knew that very instant,  
She meant to do me harm.  
  
""Depart from me this moment,""  
I told her with my voice.  
Said she, ""But I don't wish to,""  
Said I, ""But you have no choice.""  
""I beg you, sir,"" she pleaded  
From the corners of her mouth,  
""I will secretly accept you  
And together we'll fly south.""  
  
Just then Tom Paine, himself,  
Came running from across the field,  
Shouting at this lovely girl  
And commanding her to yield.  
And as she was letting go her grip,  
Up Tom Paine did run,

"I once loved a girl, her skin it was bronze.  
With the innocence of a lamb, she was gentle like a fawn.  
I courted her proudly but now she is gone,  
Gone as the season she's taken.  
  
Through young summer's breeze, I stole her away  
From her mother and sister, though close did they stay.  
Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day,  
With strings of guilt they tried hard to guide us.  
  
Of the two sisters, I loved the young.  
With sensitive instincts, she was the creative one.  
The constant scapegoat, she was easily undone  
By the jealousy of others around her.  
  
For her parasite sister, I had no respect,  
Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect.  
Countless visions of the other she'd reflect  
As a crutch for her scenes and her society.  
  
Myself, for what I did, I cannot be excused,  
The changes I was going through can't even be used,  
For the lies that I told her in hopes not to lose  
The could-be dream-lover of my lifetime.  
  
With unknown consciousness, I possessed in my grip  
A magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped,  
Noticing not that I'd already slipped  
To a sin of love's false security.  
  
From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace,  
Answers of emptiness, voice vacancies,  
Till the tombstones of damage read me no questions but, ""Please,  
What's wrong and what's exactly the matter?""  
  
And so it did happen like it could have been foreseen,  
The timeless explosion of fantasy's dream.  
At the peak of the night, the king and the queen  
Tumbled all down into pieces.  
  
""The tragic figure!"" her sister did shout,  
""Leave her alone, God damn you, get out!""  
And I in my armor, turning about  
And nailing her to the ruins of her pettiness.  
  
Beneath a bare light bulb the plaster did pound  
Her sister and I in a screaming battleground.  
And she in between, the victim of sound,  
Soon shattered as a child 'neath her shadows.  
  
All is gone, all is gone, admit it, take flight.  
I gagged twice, doubled, tears blinding my sight.  
My mind it was mangled, I ran into the night  
Leaving all of love's ashes behind me.  
  
The wind knocks my window, the room it is wet.  
The words to say I'm sorry, I haven't found yet.  
I think of her often and hope whoever she's met  
Will be fully aware of how precious she is.  
  
Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me,

And I answer them most mysteriously,  
""Are birds free from the chains of the skyway?""

They took all the trees, they put them in a tree museum  
They charged the people a dollar and a half just to see them  
Don't it always go to show  
You never know what you got till it's gone?  
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot.  
  
Hey farmer, farmer, put away the D.D.T  
Give me spots on my apples but leave the birds and the bees, please  
Don't it always go to show  
You never know what you got till it's gone?  
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot.  
  
Late last night I heard my screen door slam  
A big yellow bulldozer took away the house and land  
Don't it always go to show  
You never know what you got till it's gone?  
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot.

Lawman on your trail, he'd like to catch ya  
Bounty hunters, too, they'd like to get ya

Campin' out all night on the berenda  
Dealin' cards 'til dawn in the hacienda  
Up to Boot Hill they'd like to send ya

Into her dark hallway she will lead ya  
In some lonesome shadows she will greet ya

Bullet holes and scars between the spaces

"Up on the white veranda  
She wears a necktie and a Panama hat.  
Her passport shows a face  
From another time and place  
She looks nothing like that.  
And all the remnants of her recent past  
Are scattered in the wild wind.  
She walks across the marble floor  
Where a voice from the gambling room is callin' her to come on in.  
She smiles, walks the other way  
As the last ship sails and the moon fades away  
From Black Diamond Bay.  
  
As the morning light breaks open, the Greek comes down  
And he asks for a rope and a pen that will write.  
""Pardon, monsieur,"" the desk clerk says,  
Carefully removes his fez,  
""Am I hearing you right?""  
And as the yellow fog is lifting  
The Greek is quickly heading for the second floor.  
She passes him on the spiral staircase  
Thinking he's the Soviet Ambassador,  
She starts to speak, but he walks away  
As the storm clouds rise and the palm branches sway  
On Black Diamond Bay.  
  
A soldier sits beneath the fan  
Doing business with a tiny man who sells him a ring.  
Lightning strikes, the lights blow out.  
The desk clerk wakes and begins to shout,  
""Can you see anything?""  
Then the Greek appears on the second floor  
In his bare feet with a rope around his neck,  
While a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle,  
Says, ""Open up another deck.""  
But the dealer says, ""Attendez-vous, s'il vous plait,''  
As the rain beats down and the cranes fly away  
From Black Diamond Bay.  
  
The desk clerk heard the woman laugh  
As he looked around the aftermath and the soldier got tough.  
He tried to grab the woman's hand,  
Said, ""Here's a ring, it cost a grand.""  
She said, ""That ain't enough.""  
Then she ran upstairs to pack her bags  
While a horse-drawn taxi waited at the curb.  
She passed the door that the Greek had locked,  
Where a handwritten sign read, ""Do Not Disturb.""  
She knocked upon it anyway  
As the sun went down and the music did play  
On Black Diamond Bay.  
  
""I've got to talk to someone quick!""  
But the Greek said, ""Go away,"" and he kicked the chair to the floor.  
He hung there from the chandelier.  
She cried, ""Help, there's danger near  
Please open up the door!""  
Then the volcano erupted  
And the lava flowed down from the mountain high above.  
The soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner  
Thinking of forbidden love.  
But the desk clerk said, ""It happens every day,""  
As the stars fell down and the fields burned away  
On Black Diamond Bay.  
  
As the island slowly sank  
The loser finally broke the bank in the gambling room.  
The dealer said, ""It's too late now.  
You can take your money, but I don't know how  
You'll spend it in the tomb.""  
The tiny man bit the soldier's ear  
As the floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew,  
While she's out on the balcony, where a stranger tells her,  
""My darling, je vous aime beaucoup.""  
She sheds a tear and then begins to pray  
As the fire burns on and the smoke drifts away  
From Black Diamond Bay.  
  
I was sitting home alone one night in L.A.,  
Watching old Cronkite on the seven o'clock news.  
It seems there was an earthquake that  
Left nothing but a Panama hat  
And a pair of old Greek shoes.  
Didn't seem like much was happening,  
So I turned it off and went to grab another beer.  
Seems like every time you turn around  
There's another hard-luck story that you're gonna hear  
And there's really nothing anyone can say  
And I never did plan to go anyway  
To Black Diamond Bay.

"I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land  
I yelled down to Captain Arab, I'll have ya understand,  
Who came running to the deck and said ""Boys! Forget the whale -  
We're goin' over yonder. Cut the engines. Change the sails.""  
""Haul on that bowline!"" we sang that melody,  
Like all tough sailors do when they're far away at sea.  
  
""I think I'll call it America."" I said as we hit land.  
I took a deep breath. I fell down, I could not stand.  
Captain Arab he starting writing out some deeds  
And said ""Let's build us a fort and start buying the place with beads.?  
Just then a cop come down the street crazy as a loon  
And throws us all in jail for carryin' harpoons.  
  
Aw, me, I busted out - don't even ask me how,  
I went lookin' for some help, I walked past a Guernsey cow  
Who directed me down to the Bowery slums  
Where people carried signs around sayin' ""BAN THE BUMS!"".  
I jumped right in line, sayin' ""I hope that I'm not late""  
When I realized I hadn't eaten for five days straight.  
  
I went into a restaurant lookin' for the cook -  
I told him I was the editor of a famous etiquette book.  
The waiter he was handsome and he wore a powder blue cape.  
I ordered up some Suzette, I said ""Could you please make that crepe?""  
Just then the whole kitchen exploded from boiling fat -  
Food was flyin' everywhere - I left without my hat.  
  
I didn't mean to be nosy so I went into a bank  
To try to get some bail for the boys back in the tank.  
They asked me for some collateral and I pulled down my pants.  
They threw me in the alley, when up comes this girl from France  
Who invited me to her place. I went, but she had a friend  
Who knocked me out an' robbed my boots an' was I on the street again.  
  
I went up to a big house with a U.S. flag upon display.  
I said ""Can you please help me out, I got some friends down the way.""  
The man said ""Get out of here or I'll tear you limb from limb.""  
I said ""You know, they refused Jesus, too."" He said ""You're not him.  
Get out of here before I break your bones. I'm not your pop.""  
I decided to have him arrested and went looking for a cop.  
  
I ran back outside and got into a cab  
I ran out the other door - this English man said ""Fab!""  
As he saw me leap a hot dog stand and a chariot that stood  
Parked across from a building advertising brotherhood.  
I ran right through the door like a hobo sailor does,  
But it was just a funeral parlor and the man asked me who I was  
I repeated that all my friends were in jail, with a sigh.  
He gave me his card and said ""Call me if they die.""  
I shook his hand and said goodbye and went back out on the street,  
When a bowling ball came down the road and knocked me off my feet.  
A pay phone was ringin' - and it just about blew my mind -  
When I picked it up an' said ""hello"", this foot came through the line!  
  
Well about this time I was fed up at trying to make a stab  
At gettin' any help for my friends and Captain Arab.  
I needed a coin to flip, like either heads or tails,  
Would let me know if I should go back to ship or back to jail.  
So I hocked my sailor's suit an' I got a coin to flip.  
It came up tails, it rhymed with sails, so I made it back to the ship.  
  
Well I got back and took the parking ticket off the mast.  
I was ripping it to shreds when this Coast Guard boat went past.  
They asked me my name and I said ""Captain Kidd"".  
They believed me but they wanted to know exactly what I did.  
I said ""For the Pope of Eyruke I was employed""  
They let me go right away, they were very paranoid.  
  
Well the last I heard of Arab he was stuck on the side of a whale  
That was married to the deputy sheriff of the jail,  
But the funniest thing was - as I was leavin' the bay -  
I saw three ships sailing and they were all headed my way.  
So I asked the Captain what his name was an' how come he didn't drive a
truck??  
He said his name was Columbus an' I just said ""Good luck...""

I want to hide a while behind your smile,  
And everywhere I look your eyes I find.  
For me to love you now, would be the sweetest thing,  
T'would make me sing,  
Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind.  
  
When rain has hung the leaves with tears,  
I want you near, to kill my fears,  
To help me to leave all my blues behind.  
Standing in your heart is where I want to be  
And long to be,  
Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind.

"Sixteen years,  
Sixteen banners united over the field  
Where the good shepherd grieves.  
Desperate men, desperate women divided,  
Spreading their wings 'neath the falling leaves.  
  
Fortune calls.  
I stepped forth from the shadows, to the marketplace,  
Merchants and thieves, hungry for power, my last deal gone down.  
She's smelling sweet like the meadows where she was born,  
On midsummer's eve, near the tower.  
  
The cold-blooded moon.  
The captain waits above the celebration  
Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid  
Whose ebony face is beyond communication.  
The captain is down but still believing that his love will be repaid.  
  
They shaved her head.  
She was torn between Jupiter and Apollo.  
A messenger arrived with a black nightingale.  
I seen her on the stairs and I couldn't help but follow,  
Follow her down past the fountain where they lifted her veil.  
  
I stumbled to my feet.  
I rode past destruction in the ditches  
With the stitches still mending 'neath a heart-shaped tattoo.  
Renegade priests and treacherous young witches  
Were handing out the flowers that I'd given to you.  
  
The palace of mirrors  
Where dog soldiers are reflected,  
The endless road and the wailing of chimes,  
The empty rooms where her memory is protected,  
Where the angels' voices whisper to the souls of previous times.  
  
She wakes him up  
Forty-eight hours later, the sun is breaking  
Near broken chains, mountain laurel and rolling rocks.  
She's begging to know what measures he now will be taking.  
He's pulling her down and she's clutching on to his long golden locks.  
  
Gentlemen, he said,  
I don't need your organization, I've shined your shoes,  
I've moved your mountains and marked your cards  
But Eden is burning, either brace yourself for elimination  
Or else your hearts must have the courage for the changing of the guards.  
  
Peace will come  
With tranquility and splendor on the wheels of fire  
But will bring us no reward when her false idols fall  
And cruel death surrenders with its pale ghost retreating  
Between the King and the Queen of Swords.

"The jingle bells are jingling  
The streets  
Are white with snow  
The happy crowds are mingling  
But there's no one that I know  
  
I'm sure that you'll forgive me  
If I don't enthuse  
I guess  
I've got the Christmas blues  
  
I've done my window shopping  
There's not a store I've missed  
But what's the use of stopping  
When there's no one on your list  
  
You'll know the way I'm feeling  
When you love and you lose  
I guess  
I've got the Christmas blues  
  
When somebody wants you  
Somebody needs you  
Christmas is a joy of joys  
But friends when you're lonely  
You'll find that it's only  
A thing for little girls  
And little boys  
  
May all your days be merry  
Your seasons full of cheer  
But 'til it's January  
I'll just go and disappear  
Oh Santa  
May have brought you  
Some stars for your shoes  
  
But Santa only brought me  
The blues  
Those brightly packaged  
Tinsel covered

I'd fly the river to the one I love  
Fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well.  
I had a man, who was long and tall,  
Moved his body like a cannon ball.  
Fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well.  
  
'Member one evening, it was drizzling rain  
And in my heart I felt an aching pain.  
Fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well.  
  
Once I wore my apron low,  
Been a-keep' you away from my door.  
Fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well.  
  
Now my apron is up to my chin,  
You pass my door but you never come in.  
Fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well.  
  
Muddy river runs muddy 'n' wild,  
You can't care the bloody for my unborn child.  
Fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well.  
  
Number nine train ain' done no harm,  
Number nine train take my poor baby home.  
Fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well.  
  
Fastest man I ever saw  
Skid Missouri on the way to Arkansas.  
Fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well.

"I hate myself for lovin' you and the weakness that it showed  
You were just a painted face on a trip down Suicide Road.  
The stage was set, the lights went out all around the old hotel,  
I hate myself for lovin' you and I'm glad the curtain fell.  
  
I hate that foolish game we played and the need that was expressed  
And the mercy that you showed to me, who ever would have guessed?  
I went out on Lower Broadway and I felt that place within,  
That hollow place where martyrs weep and angels play with sin.  
  
Heard your songs of freedom and man forever stripped,  
Acting out his folly while his back is being whipped.  
Like a slave in orbit, he's beaten 'til he's tame,  
All for a moment's glory and it's a dirty, rotten shame.  
  
There are those who worship loneliness, I'm not one of them,  
In this age of fiberglass I'm searching for a gem.  
The crystal ball up on the wall hasn't shown me nothing yet,  
I've paid the price of solitude, but at last I'm out of debt.  
  
Can't recall a useful thing you ever did for me  
'Cept pat me on the back one time when I was on my knees.  
We stared into each other's eyes 'til one of us would break,  
No use to apologize, what diff'rence would it make?  
  
So sing your praise of progress and of the Doom Machine,  
The naked truth is still taboo whenever it can be seen.  
Lady Luck, who shines on me, will tell you where I'm at,  
I hate myself for lovin' you, but I should get over that.

In the early morning rain with nowhere to go.  
  
Cut on runway number nine, big 707 set to go

The liquor tasted good and the women all were fast  
There she goes, my friend, she's rolling down at last.  
  
Hear the mighty engines roar, see the silver bird on high  
She's away and westward bound, far above the clouds she'll fly  
Where the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shines  
She'll be flying over my home in about three hours time.  
  
This old airport's got me down, it's no earthly good to me  
Because I'm stuck here on the ground, cold and drunks as I might be  
You can't hop a jet plane like you can a freight train  
So I'd best be on my way in the early morning rain.

Her eyes was on fire

The sun beams down upon the steps of time to light the way  
To ease the pain of idleness and the memory of decay  
  
I gaze into the doorway of temptation's angry flame  
And every time I pass that way I'll always hear my name  
Then onward in my journey I come to understand  
That every hair is numbered like every grain of sand  
  
I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night  
In the violence of a summer's dream, in the chill of a wintry light  
In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space  
In the broken mirror of innocence on each forgotten face  
  
I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea  
Sometimes I turn, there's someone there, other times it's only me

"Farewell Angelina  
The bells of the crown  
Are being stolen by bandits  
I must follow the sound  
The triangle tingles  
And the trumpet play slow  
Farewell Angelina  
The sky is on fire  
And I must go.  
  
There's no need for anger  
There's no need for blame  
There's nothing to prove  
Ev'rything's still the same  
Just a table standing empty  
By the edge of the sea  
Farewell Angelina  
The sky is trembling  
And I must leave.  
  
The jacks and queens  
Have forsaked the courtyard  
Fifty-two gypsies  
Now file past the guards  
In the space where the deuce  
And the ace once ran wild  
Farewell Angelina  
The sky is folding  
I'll see you in a while.  
  
See the cross-eyed pirates sitting  
Perched in the sun  
Shooting tin cans  
With a sawed-off shotgun  
And the neighbors they clap  
And they cheer with each blast  
Farewell Angelina  
The sky's changing color  
And I must leave fast.  
  
King Kong, little elves  
On the rooftoops they dance  
Valentino-type tangos  
While the make-up man's hands  
Shut the eyes of the dead  
Not to embarrass anyone  
Farewell Angelina  
The sky is embarrassed  
And I must be gone.  
  
The machine guns are roaring  
The puppets heave rocks  
The fiends nail time bombs  
To the hands of the clocks  
Call me any name you like  
I will never deny it  
Farewell Angelina  
The sky is erupting  
I must go where it's quiet.

"I hear that train a-rolling, it's a-rolling round the bend  
I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when  
I'm stucked in Folsom Prison and time keeps dragging on  
And I hear that whistle blowing all down to San Antone  
  
When I was just a baby my momma told me: son  
Always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns  
But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die  
When I hear that train a-pulling I hang my head and cry  
  
I bet there's rich folks eating in their fancy dining cars  
They're probably drinking coffee and smoking big cigars  
But I know I had it coming, I know I can't be free  
But the people keep a-moving, and that's what tortures me  
  
If they'd free me from this prison, if that railroad train was mine  
You bet I moved it on a little further down the line  
Far from Folsom Prison that's where I long to stay

Its curfew gull just glides  
Upon four-legged forest clouds  
The cowboy angel rides  
With his candle lit into the sun  
Though its glow is waxed in black  
All except when 'neath the trees of Eden  
  
The lamppost stands with folded arms  
Its iron claws attached  
To curbs 'neath holes where babies wail  
Though it shadows metal badge  
All and all can only fall  
With a crashing but meaningless blow  
No sound ever comes from the Gates of Eden  
  
The savage soldier sticks his head in sand  
And then complains  
Unto the shoeless hunter who's gone deaf  
But still remains  
Upon the beach where hound dogs bay  
At ships with tattooed sails  
Heading for the Gates of Eden  
  
With a time-rusted compass blade  
Aladdin and his lamp  
Sits with Utopian hermit monks  
Side saddle on the Golden Calf  
And on their promises of paradise  
You will not hear a laugh  
All except inside the Gates of Eden

The motorcycle black Madonna  
Two-wheeled gypsy queen  
And her silver-studded phantom cause  
The gray flannel dwarf to scream  
As he weeps to wicked birds of prey  
Who pick up on his bread crumb sins  
And there are no sins inside the Gates of Eden  
  
The kingdoms of experience  
In the precious wind they rot  
While paupers change possessions  
Each one wishing for what the other has got  
And the princess and the prince  
Discuss what's real and what is not  
It doesn't matter inside the Gates of Eden  
  
The foreign sun, it squints upon  
A bed that is never mine  
As friends and other strangers  
From their fates try to resign  
Leaving men wholly, totally free  
To do anything they wish to do but die  
And there are no trials inside the Gates of Eden  
  
At dawn my lover comes to me  
And tells me of her dreams  
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse  
Into the ditch of what each one means  
At times I think there are no words  
But these to tell what's true  
And there are no truths outside the Gates of Eden

Noontime, and I'm still pushing myself along the road, the darkest part  
Into the narrow lanes, I can't stumble or stay put  
Someone else is speaking with my mouth, but I'm listening with my heart  
I've made shoes for everyone, even you, while I go barefoot.  
  
I and I  
In creation where one's nature neither honors nor forgives  
I and I  
One say to the other, no man sees my face and lives.

'Cause I don't be like they'd like me to

A thousand miles from home  
But I don't feel alone  
'Cause I believe in you.  
  
I believe in you even through the tears and the laughter  
I believe in you even though we be apart  
I believe in you even on the morning after  
Oh, when the dawn is nearing  
Oh, when the night is disappearing  
Oh, this feeling is still here in my heart.  
  
Don't let me drift too far  
Keep me where you are  
Where I will always be renewed  
And that which you've given me today  
Is worth more than I could pay  
And no matter what they say  
I believe in you.

I believe in you when white turn to black

"I can't understand, she let go of my hand  
An' left me here facing the wall  
I'd sure like to know, why she did go  
But I can't get close to her at all  
Though we kissed through the wild blazing nighttime  
She said she would never forget  
But now morning is clear, it's like I ain't here  
She acts like we never met  
It's all new to me like some mystery  
It could even be like a myth  
Yet it's hard to think on that she's the same one  
That last night I was with  
From darkness, dreams are deserted  
Am I still dreamin' yet?  
I wish she'd unlock her voice once an' talk  
'Stead of acting like we never met  
If she ain't feelin' well then why don't she tell  
'Stead of turnin' her back to my face?  
Without any doubt, she seems too far out  
For me to return to her chase  
Though her skirt it swayed as a guitar played  
Her mouth was watery and wet  
But now something has changed for she ain't the same  
She just acts like we never have met  
If I didn't have to guess, I'd gladly confess  
To anything I might've tried  
If I was with her too long or have done something wrong  
I'd wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run an' hide  
Though the night ran swirling an' whirling  
I remember her whispering yet  
But evidently she don't, evidently she won't  
She just acts like we never have met  
I'm leavin' today, I'll be on my way  
Of this I can't say very much  
But if you want me to, I can be just like you  
An' pretend that we never have touched  
An' if anybody asks me, ""Is it easy to forget?""  
I'll say, ""It's easily done  
You just pick anyone  
An' pretend that you never have met""

"I dreamed I saw St. Augustine  
Alive as you or me  
Tearing through these quarters  
In the utmost misery  
With a blanket underneath his arm  
And a coat of solid gold  
Searching for the very souls  
Whom already have been sold.  
  
""Arise, arise"", he cried so loud  
With a voice without restraint  
""Come out ye gifted kings and queens  
And hear my sad complaint  
No martyr is among ye now  
Whom you can call your own  
So go on your way accordingly  
But know you're not alone"".

Alive with fiery breath  
And I dreamed I was amongst the ones  
That put him out to death

So alone and terrified

And bowed my head and cried.

I's three-fourths drunk, she looked uptight.

Took off her wig, said, ""How do I smell?""

Every week she sends me a monthly check.

Eyes were closed I was half asleep.

Wants me to grow a cigar on my face.

Just do your thing, you'll be king,  
If dogs run free.  
  
If dogs run free, why not me  
Across the swamp of time?  
My mind weaves a symphony  
And tapestry of rhyme.  
Oh, winds which rush my tale to thee  
So it may flow and be,  
To each his own, it's all unknown,  
If dogs run free.  
  
If dogs run free, then what must be,  
Must be, and that is all.  
True love can make a blade of grass  
Stand up straight and tall.  
In harmony with the cosmic sea,  
True love needs no company,  
It can cure the soul, it can make it whole,  
If dogs run free.

I believe that she'd look upon beside him to care

No I don't belong to her, I don't belong to every choir  
She's my prize forsaken angel, but she don't hear me cry

"I married Isis on the fifth day of May  
But I could not hold on to her very long  
So I cut off my hair and I rode straight away  
For the wild unknown country where I could not go wrong.  
  
I came to a high place of darkness and light  
The dividing line ran through the center of town  
I hitched up my pony to a post on the right  
Went in to a laundry to wash my clothes down.  
  
A man in the corner approached me for a match  
I knew right away he was not ordinary  
He said ""Are you looking for something easy to catch ?""  
I said ""I got no money"". He said ""That ain't necessary"".  
  
We set out that night for the cold in the North  
I gave him my blanket he gave me his word  
I said ""Where are we going ?"" He said ""We'd be back by the fourth""  
I said ""That's the best new that I've ever heard"".  
  
I was thinking about turquoise I was thinking about gold  
I was thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace  
As we rode through the canyons through the devilish cold  
I was thinking about Isis how she thought I was so reckless.  
  
How she told me that one day we meet up again  
And things would be different the next time we wed  
If I only could hang on and just be her friend  
I still can't remember all the best things she said.  
  
We came to the pyramids all embedded in ice  
He said ""There's a body I'm trying to find  
If I carry it out it'll bring a good prize""  
It was then that I knew what he had on his mind.  
  
The wind it was howling and the snow was outrageous  
We chopped through the night and we chopped through the dawn  
When he died I was hoping that it wasn't contagious  
But I made up my mind that I had to go on.  
I broke into the tomb but the casket was empty  
There was no jewels no nothing I felt I'd been had  
When I saw that my partner was just being friendly  
When I took up his offer I must-a been mad.  
  
I picked up his body and I dragged him inside  
Threw him down in the hole and I put back the cover  
I said a quick prayer and I felt satisfied  
Then I rode back to find Isis just to tell her I love her.  
  
She was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise  
Blinded by sleep and in need of a bed  
I came in from the East with the sun in my eyes  
I cursed her one time then I rode on ahead.  
  
She said ""Where ya been ?"" I said ""No place special ?""  
She said ""You look different"" I said ""Well I guess""  
She said ""You been gone"" I said ""That's only natural""  
She said ""You gonna stay ?"" I said ""If you want me to, Yeah "".

I still can remember the way that you smiled

Cows aren't fun  
  
They eat to grow, grow to die  
Die to be et at the hamburger fry  
Cows well done  
  
Nobody thunk it, nobody knew  
No one imagined the great cow guru  
Cows are one  
  
He hid in the forest, read books with great zeal  
He loved Che Guevara, a revolutionary veal  
Cow Tse Tung  
  
He spoke about justice, but nobody stirred  
He felt like an outcast, alone in the herd  
Cow doldrums  
  
He mooed ""We must fight, escape or we'll die""  
Cows gathered around, cause the steaks were so high  
Bad cow pun  
  
But then he was captured, stuffed into a crate  
Loaded onto a truck, where he rode to his fate  
Cows are bummed  
  
He was a scrawny calf, who looked rather woozy  
No one suspected he was packing an Uzi  
Cows with guns  
  
They came with a needle to stick in his thigh  
He kicked for the groin, he pissed in their eye  
Cow well hung  
  
Knocked over a tractor and ran for the door  
Six gallons of gas flowed out on the floor  
Run cows run!  
  
He picked up a bullhorn and jumped up on the hay  
We are free roving bovines, we run free today  
  
We will fight for bovine freedom  
And hold our large heads high  
We will run free with the buffalo, or die  
Cows with guns  
  
They crashed the gate in the great stampede  
Tipped over a milk truck, torched all the feed  
Cows have fun  
  
Sixty police cars were piled in a heap  
Covered in cow pies, covered up deep  
Much cow dung  
  
Black smoke rising, darkening the day  
Twelve burning Mcdonalds, have it your way  
  
We will fight for bovine freedom  
And hold our large heads high  
We will run free with the Buffalo, or die  
Cows with guns  
  
The President said ""enough is enough  
These uppity cattle, it's time to get tough""  
Cow dung flung  
  
The newspapers gloated, folks sighed with relief  
Tomorrow at noon, they would all be ground beef  
Cows on buns  
  
The cows were surrounded, they waited and prayed  
They mooed their last moos, they chewed their last hay  
Cows out gunned  
  
The order was given to turn cows to whoppers  
Enforced by the might of ten thousand coppers  
But on the horizon surrounding the shoppers  
Came the deafening roar of chickens in choppers  
  
We will fight for bovine freedom  
And hold our large heads high  
We will run free with the Buffalo, or die  
Cows with guns

Where the latest neon promises are burning bright  
  
Past the open windows on the darker streets  
Where unseen angry voices flash and children cry  
Past the phony posers with their worn out lines  
The tired new money dressed to the nines  
The low life dealers with their bad designs  
And the dilettantes with their open minds  
  
You're out on the town, safe in the crowd  
Ready to go for the ride  
Searching the eyes, looking for clues  
There's no way you can hide

Well you've been to the clubs and the discotheques  
Where they deal one another from the bottom of a deck of promises  
Where the cautious loners and emotional wrecks  
Do an acting stretch as a way to hide the obvious  
And the lights go down and they dance real close  
And for one brief instant they pretend they're safe and warm  
  
Then the beat gets louder and the mood is gone  
The darkness scatters as the lights flash on  
They hold one another just a little too long  
And they move apart and then move on  
  
On to the street, on to the next  
Safe in the knowledge that they tried  
Faking the smile, hiding the pain  
Never satisfied  
The fire inside  
Fire inside  
  
Now the hour is late and he thinks you're asleep  
You listen to him dress and you listen to him leave  
Like you knew he would  
You hear his car pull away in the street  
Then you move to the door and you lock it when  
He's gone for good  
  
Then you walk to the window and stare at the moon  
Riding high and lonesome through a starlit sky  
And it comes to you how it all slips away  
Youth and beauty are gone one day  
No matter what you dream or feel or say  
It ends in dust and disarray

My eyes were clear and bright  
My walk had purpose  
My steps were quick and light

To what I felt was right

Like a rock, I was strong as I could be  
Like a rock, nothin', ever got to me  
Like a rock, I was something to see  
Like a rock  
  
And I stood arrow straight  
Unencumbered by the weight  
Of all these hustlers and their schemes  
I stood proud, I stood tall  
High above it all  
I still believed in my dreams  
  
Twenty years now  
Where',d they go?  
Twenty years  
I don',t know  
I sit and I wonder sometimes  
Where they',ve gone  
  
And sometimes late at night  
When I',m bathed in the firelight  
The moon comes callin', a ghostly white  
And I recall  
I recall  
  
Like a rock, standin', arrow straight  
Like a rock, chargin', from the gate  
Like a rock, carryin', the weight

"When your baby up and leaves you  
Up and leaves you flat  
Don't you laugh my friend sometimes it happens just like that  
First you feel the anger then the sorrow will soon take control  
And there'll be hard times for sure  
Long cold lonely nights  
  
It might not sound like much  
But it'll mean a lot you'll see  
Every hour you survive will come to be  
A little victory  
Little victory  
  
As you struggle through each day  
Each strange new day  
Feelin' lost and wounded tryin' hard to find your way  
No one there to talk it out with  
Learnin' how to sleep alone  
Overcomin' each new doubt  
Tryin' hard just to accept it all  
  
Everytime you keep control when you're cut off at the knees  
Everytime you take a punch and still stand at ease  
Little victories  
Little victories  
  
And when night falls and there's no one around  
The cruelest time of all and not one sound  
Listenin' to the wind blow  
Listenin' to the tickin' of the clock  
Tryin' hard to forget  
Tryin' hard to just accept it all  
  
As you step out in the night take a lesson from the trees  
Watch the way they learn to bend with each breeze  
Little victories  
Everytime you make it through  
It's another little victory  
Day by day minute by minute  
Little victories

They were married late one May

Sometimes she'd walk 'neath the moon  
Sometimes she'd sit there just watching him sleeping

She'd followed the rules  
And she'd always stood out from the rest  
She'd go off to college

She had it all planned  
She'd have her career  
She'd have all of the things that she'd always lacked

"Jan is tired of her inhaler  
When she moved here from back east  
Still she said she'd stay beside me  
And she brought me a new peace  
I saw her smilin' in the summer sun  
I saw her 'neath the quiet moon  
I knew right then I'd never leave her  
She had taken me so soon  
When she went  
She went  
And we settled near the blue lagoon  
Listened all night to the wind  
Sometimes we laughed, sometimes we cried  
Sometimes we just went for a swim  
All that time my love kept growing, growing, growing  
Made me feel so warm inside  
All the time her smile glowing  
And it gave me so much pride  
When she went, yeah when she went  
Yeah, now we sit here in the evening  
And listen to the crickets sing  
And we'll be here twenty years from now  
And we'll hear the crickets sing  
And then she'll go, oh, oh, oh, oh  
She'll go

Caught like a wildfire out of control  
'Til there was nothing left to burn and nothing left to prove

How she swore that it never would end  
I remember how she held me oh so tight

I found myself further and further from my home

There were oh so many roads  
I was living to run and running to live  
Never worryied about paying or even how much I owed  
Moving eight miles a minute for months at a time  
Breaking all of the rules that would bend  
I began to find myself searching  
Searching for shelter again and again  
  
Against the wind  
A little something against the wind  
I found myself seeking shelter sgainst the wind

Deadlines and commitments  
What to leave in, what to leave out

There's a hole in your wisdom, a hole in your sky  
Two holes in your head where the light's supposed to get by  
  
Time to lock and load  
Time to get control  
Time to search the soul  
And start again  
  
So many times I've seen chances disappear  
I hesitate and watch them slip away  
Like the time I fail to spend with the ones I love  
And it's gone as sure as yesterday  
All these users and fakers, big time takers  
Manipulating everyone they see  
I get caught up in their schemes and their useless dreams  
And the only one I have to blame is me  
I get turned 'round and twisted, pulled left and right  
I can see where I'm goin', but I can't see the light  
  
Time to lock and load  
Come in from the cold  
Take a different road  
And start again  
  
I can sit here, in the back half of my life  
And wonder when the other shoe will fall  
Or I can stand up, point myself home  
And see if I've learned anything at all  
Anything at all  
  
Mediocrity's easy, the good things take time  
The great need commitment, right down the line  
  
Time to lock and load  
Come in from the cold  
Pay these debts I owe  
And start again  
  
I've been down this road  
I've seen things get old  
Time to get control  
And start it all again  
  
Time to lock and load  
Time to get control  
Time to search the soul  
And start again  
  
I've been down this road  
I've seen things get old  
Stand up, get bold  
And start it all again  
  
Time to lock and load

Now Louise she is an outlaw, in the year of seventy one  
She's got Levi bells and long straight hair  
She's got a gun  
Her folks they didn't under-stand why she could'nt  
Get her homework done, mmm  
Her father is a preacher, her mother's an ex-nun  
  
Now Louise she likes to boogie, down at the old ballroom  
She's got a crazy hophead boyfriend, digs freon balloons  
They ride on his Harley from the morning till the late afternoon  
They get stoned in the evening, and make love beneath the moon  
  
Now the old folks who are listenin'  
Prob'ly think think this song's obscene  
Say your children aren't like that  
Say my words are way off theme  
Well Louise she's just an  
Average product of the American dream  
I concede she's kind of naive but  
After all she's only thirteen  
  
Ride on Louise, ride on, ride on

Trying to get my courage up  
There was this long lovely dancer in a little club downtown  
I loved to watch her do her stuff  
Through the long lonely nights she filled my sleep  
Her body softly swaying to that smoky beat  
Down on Mainstreet  
  
In the pool halls, the hustlers and the losers  
I used to watch 'em through the glass  
Well I'd stand outside at closing time  
Just to watch her walk on past  
Unlike all the other ladies, she looked so young and sweet  
As she made her way alone down that empty street  
Down on Mainstreet  
  
And sometimes even now, when I'm feeling lonely and beat  
I drift back in time and I find my feet  
Down on Mainstreet

"Took a look down a westbound road right away I made my choice  
Headed out to my big two wheeler I was tired of my own voice  
Took a bead on the northern plains and just rolled that power on  
  
Twelve hours out of Mackinaw City stopped in a bar to have a brew  
Met a girl and we had a few drinks and I told her what I'd decided to do  
She looked out the window a long long moment then she looked into my eyes  
She didn't have to say a thing I knew what she was thinkin'

I too am lost I feel double crossed  
And I'm sick of what's wrong and what's right  
We never even said a word we just walked out and got on that bike  
And we rolled  
And we rolled clean out of sight  
  
We rolled across the high plains  
Deep into the mountains  
Felt so good to me  
Finally feelin' free  
Somewhere along a high road  
The air began to turn cold  
She said she missed her home  
I headed on alone  
  
Stood alone on a mountain top starin' out at the Great Divide  
I could go east I could go west it was all up to me to decide  
Just then I saw a young hawk flyin' and my soul began to rise  
And pretty soon  
My heart was singin'  
  
Roll roll away I'm gonna roll me away tonight  
Gotta keep rollin' gotta keep ridin' keep searchin' till I find what's right

"Some fifteen year old kid sits on his porch

Why he had to grow up so soon  
With all the gangs, all the guns, watcha gonna learn in school?  
There's got to be some way out of here  
He says, ""Man, this life is cruel""  
I knew this Puerto Rican girl who lied to change her life  
She changed her name, her face  
Because the grass looked greener on the other side  
She turned her back, she ran away straight into the night

Died in his room just the other day  
His brother come home  
Found him dead on the floor with a needle in his vein

It was them who brought you water

Right there in a mother's eyes  
At a table in a restaurant window  
In a taxi passing by  
Love went running up the stairwell  
When the sky came falling down  
It was him in a newborn baby's cry  
He was there to make that sound  
That keeps this whole world spinning 'round

It never crossed my mind to ask where did you come from  
I didn't have much money so I stole you a rose  
You were dressed like an orphan in salvation army clothes  
  
I never thought I'd lose you,nor I'd rather go blind  
I thought I saw a future but the fortune teller lied  
  
Your love was my salvation it could always get me high  
What was once holy water tastes like bitter wine  
  
I know I wasn't funny but you laughed at all my jokes  
When I was choking on the words to say you your fingers down my throat  
The first night I said I love you you told me to go to hell  
You were giving me head on that creaky bed at the old duval motel  
  
Just like everything good love has to die  
Ain't no sympathy when it says goodbye  
  
Your love was my salvation it could always get me high  
What was once holy water tastes like bitter wine  
  
Just like everything good love has to die  
No one even cried we were one of a kind  
  
Love left me stranded at the station and the last train's gone by  
What was once holy water tastes like bitter wine  
  
Your love was my salvation it could always get me high  
You take back the holy water now all that's left is bitter wine

We're just who we are, there's no pretending  
It takes a while to learn to live in your own skin  
Say a prayer that we might find our happy ending  
And if you're in you know I'm in  
I'm ready and I'm willing

That stormy day on the beach that got us here  
  
Oh, you better believe theres just one thing you need  
Can't you see...  
  
Its just me baby  
Its just me baby  
If theres just one thing that you should keep  
In your book of dreams  
Its just me baby  
  
Just like a shadow 10 feet tall  
Standing right behind you should you fall  
Ill be the one to hold you up to walk  
When this wicked world makes us want to crawl  
  
Abd if your waves should ever break at sea  
Ill be there waiting, I'm that sandy beach  
I'm that same old dog, scratching those same fleas  
Ill be by your side, you can count on me  
  
Its just me baby  
Its just me baby  
If theres just one thing that you should keep  
In your book of dreams  
Its just me baby  
Its just me baby  
Whats it gonna take to make you see  
Whats it gonna take til you believe in me  
  
Oh, how my smile fades and my heart just breaks  
Every time you go away  
  
Its just me baby  
Its just me baby  
If theres just one thing that you should keep  
In your book of dreams  
Its just me baby  
Its just me baby  
Whats it gonna take to make you see  
Whats it gonna take til you believe in me  
  
And if someday some new memory comes along  
Looking shiny new, feeling really strong  
You can tell him that Ill tell him  
He can just move on  
I'm a fighter - I've been fighting for you all night long  
Its just me baby

"Hey, man, it's been a while  
Do you remember me?  
When I hit the streets I was 17  
A little wild, a little green  
  
I've been up and down and in between  
After all these years  
Can you believe I'm still chasing that dream  
But I ain't looking over my shoulder  
  
[Chorus]  
I like the bed I'm sleeping in  
It's just like me, it's broken in  
It's not old -- just older  
Like a favorite pair of torn blue jeans  
This skin I'm in it's alright with me  
It's not old -- just older  
  
It's good to see your face  
You ain't no worse for wear  
Breathing that California air  
When we took on the world  
When we were young and brave  
We got secrets that we'll take to the grave  
And we're standing here shoulder to shoulder  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm not old enough to sing the blues  
But I wore the holes in the soles of these shoes  
You can roll the dice 'til they call your bluff  
But you can't win until you're not afraid to lose  
  
Well, I look in the mirror  
I don't hate what I see  
There's a few more lines staring back at me  
The nights have grown a little colder  
Hey man, I gotta run  
Now you take care  
  
If you see coach T. Tell him I cut my hair  
It's been all these years  
Can you believe I'm still chasing dreams  
But I ain't looking over my shoulder

"Hey mister can you help me  
I'm a loner on the run  
I'm just looking for tomorrow  
And I ain't gonna hurt no one  
  
I jumped headfirst into a bottle  
I was looking for a friend  
Came up just short of nothing  
I didn't find the truth I only found an end  
  
So tell me who's gonna save me  
Or my father or my son  
When the only justice a man can see  
Is the barrel of a loaded gun  
  
I been broke and I've been hungry  
I think they're both my middle name  
But I don't never ever never seem to get enough  
Still guess I can't complain  
  
'Cause what you get in life you take it  
You've gotta hold on and make it last  
They say good things come to those who wait  
But it's life that goes so fast  
  
And when there's just one rule you live by  
Each day you kiss the rising sun  
When you live and die by the life we breathe  
In the barrel of a loaded gun  
  
Guns talk to me in my sleep at night  
And a gun somewhere is burning  
With my name  
  
Winners are losers  
And losers will have to face  
All those yesterdays  
And all of the dreams they blew away  
  
So mister can you help me  
Or are you my gun  
Have the ghosts of justice  
Brought you here to me to taste  
The barrel of a loaded gun  
  
There's justice in the barrel  
Of a loaded gun

"I get up every morning, drink coffee alone  
My house it's too quiet, I'm the only one home  
I let the newspapers pile up at the door  
I can't be bothered, I don't read 'em no more  
The flowers are blooming, that you planted last spring  
I can't make much sense out of anything  
  
If I could kidnap an angel, I'd clip off his wings  
And bring them to you that would fix everything

Wondering how in the world did it turn out this way?  
It's just 'round the corner, turn left and I'm there  
I'd do anything to be anywhere but here  
  
If I could kidnap an angel, I'd clip off his wings

If I could kidnap an angel he could teach us to fly  
We'd live forever, forever, we'd never die  
If I could kidnap an angel  
  
Now the parking attendant knows my first name  
These long green hallways all look the same  
There's four elevators, one goes to that floor  
I brace myself when I get to the door  
I close my eyes and take a deep breath  
Then sit down beside your hospital bed  
  
If I could kidnap an angel, I'd clip off his wings  
And bring them to you that would fix everything  
If I could kidnap an angel he could teach us to fly  
We'd live forever, forever, we'd never die  
If I could kidnap an angel, if I could kidnap an angel  
  
He'd say the word, he'd tear down these walls  
People laughing like children through these hospital halls  
There'd be no more tears, there'd be no more blood  
There'd be nothing but smiles, nothing but love  
If I could kidnap an angel, if I could kidnap an angel

Is my plastic dashboard Jesus

Oh patron saint of lonely souls  
Tell this boy which way to go  
Guide the car, you've got the keys  
Farewell to mediocrity  
Kicking off the cruise control  
And turning up the radio  
Got just enough religion  
And a half a tank of gas  
Come on  
Let's go  
  
I finally found my way  
Said goodbye to yesterday  
Hit the gas, there ain't no brakes on this lost highway  
I'm busting loose, I'm lettin' go  
When I'm out on this open road  
It's independence day on this lost highway  
Hey hey  
Hey hey  
Hey hey  
On this lost highway

If I could turn back time, you'd still be mine

Apologize for sleeping on the couch that night  
Staying out too late with all my friends  
You found me passed out in the yard again

To stretch the truth, but didn't lie  
It's not so bad when you think about it

Naked on her floor  
Windows up, the curtains blowing  
She don't lock the door

At the banquet table  
A beggar at a feast  
I felt her tongue between her lips  
And I forgot to breath  
We stayed there 'til the candles burned the carpet

"Everybody's a dreamer and everybody's a star,  
And everybody's in movies, it doesn't matter who you are.  
There are stars in every city,  
In every house and on every street,  
And if you walk down hollywood boulevard  
Their names are written in concrete!  
  
Don't step on greta garbo as you walk down the boulevard,  
She looks so weak and fragile that's why she tried to be so hard  
But they turned her into a princess  
And they sat her on a throne,  
But she turned her back on stardom,  
Because she wanted to be alone.  
  
You can see all the stars as you walk down hollywood boulevard,  
Some that you recognise, some that you've hardly even heard of,  
People who worked and suffered and struggled for fame,  
Some who succeeded and some who suffered in vain.  
Rudolph valentino, looks very much alive,  
And he looks up ladies' dresses as they sadly pass him by.  
Avoid stepping on bela lugosi  
'cos he's liable to turn and bite,  
But stand close by bette davis  
Because hers was such a lonely life.  
If you covered him with garbage,  
George sanders would still have style,  
And if you stamped on mickey rooney  
He would still turn round and smile,  
But please don't tread on dearest marilyn  
'cos she's not very tough,  
She should have been made of iron or steel,  
But she was only made of flesh and blood.

Everybody's a dreamer and everybody's a star  
And everybody's in show biz, it doesn't matter who you are.  
  
And those who are successful,  
Be always on your guard,  
Success walks hand in hand with failure  
Along hollywood boulevard.  
  
I wish my life was a non-stop hollywood movie show,  
A fantasy world of celluloid villains and heroes,  
Because celluloid heroes never feel any pain  
And celluloid heroes never really die.

Baby, baby don't you know, you're the biggest part of me  
  
It broke my heart when you said good bye, bye, bye  
You believed him when he told you a lie  
Without your love baby I'm gonna die  
  
Don't you believe him (don't you believe him)  
He's gonna fill you up with lies  
Don't you believe him darling, (don't you believe him)  
He's gone too far this time  
  
Broke my heart when you said goodbye, bye, bye  
You believed him when he told you a lie  
Without your love baby I'm gonna die  
  
Don't you believe him (don't you believe him)

Giving the people  
As I pray my soul  
I wanna get lost in rock'n'roll

Sometimes I think

"Baby, I've been thinking, it's too hard to speak these nights,  
Can I confess what's on my chest, what's really on my mind.  
See, I never was scared of nothing, there was nothing that we couldn't do,  
We used to think that we could walk on water, just because we wanted to.  
And it all seemed so easy, when we were living not just alive,  
We talked about dreams, and how we would like to spend our lives.  
  
When freedom was a tank of gas, on a long summer night,  
To drive, just drive.  
  
Can you keep a secret baby, if you can't, just lie,  
Yeah, I want to scream, when I have this dream, that my whole life passed me  
By.  
And they sold my heart for diamonds, and they sold some pride for gold,  
There's lots of things that I can't get back, that the record company owns.  
When 17 has turned 30, it's all gone kiss it goodbye.  
Hey baby, maybe we aint kids no more, but I'm too young to die.  
  
There's still some freedom in this tank of gas, if you're by my side,  
We'll drive, just drive.  
  
Don't want no airplanes, no ticket on a fast train,  
All I wanted was a two-lane, with you by my side.  
We'll drive, all night long, get on board.  
We'll drive, with the radio on.  
  
You can lean your head on my shoulder, and just for a while,  
Forget about the world, baby, mile after mile.  
We'll drive, all night long yeah, you want a ride?  
  
No airplane, no ticket on a fast train,  
All I wanted was a two-lane, and you by my side.  
We'll drive, all night long, get on board,  
We'll drive, with the radio on baby all right.

"Across the border they turn water into wine  
Some say it's the devil's blood  
They're squeezing from the vine  
Some say it's a savior  
In these hard and desperate times  
You see it helps me to forget that we're just born  
To die  
  
I came here like so many did to find a better life  
To find my piece of easy street  
To finally be alive  
And I know nothing good comes easy  
All good things take some time  
I made my bed I'll lie in it  
To die in it's the crime  
  
You can't help but prosper  
Where the streets are paved with gold  
They say the oil wells ran deeper here than anybody's known  
Now I packed up on my wife and kid  
And left them both back at home  
See there's nothing in this pay dirt  
The ghosts are all I know  
  
Now the oil's gone  
And the money's gone  
All the jobs are gone  
Still we're hangin' on  
  
Down in dry county  
They're swimming in the sand  
Praying for some holy water  
To wash the sins from off our hands  
Here in dry county  
The promise has run dry  
Where nobody cries  
And no one's getting out of here alive (Not this time)  
  
""In the blessed name of Jesus"" I heard a preacher say  
That we are all God's children  
And He'd be back, back someday  
I hoped that he knew something as he drank that cup of wine  
I didn't have too good a feeling as I head out to the night  
  
I cursed the sky to open  
I begged the clouds for rain  
I prayed all night for water  
For this burning in my veins  
It was like my soul's on fire  
And I had to watch the flames  
All my dreams went up in ashes  
And my future blew away  
  
Now the oil's gone  
And the money's gone  
All the jobs are gone  
Still we're hangin' on  
  
Down in dry county  
They're swimming in the sand  
Praying for some holy water  
To wash these sins from off our hands  
Here in dry county  
The promise has run dry  
Where nobody cries  
And no one's getting out of here alive  
  
Men spend their whole lives waiting  
Prayin' for some big reward  
But it seems sometimes the payoff  
Leaves you feeling like a dirty whore  
If I could choose the way I'd die  
Make it by the gun or knife  
'Cause the other way there's too much pain  
Night after night after night after night  
  
Down in dry county  
Where they're swimming in the sand  
Praying for some holy water  
To wash the sins from off our hands  
In dry county  
The promise has run dry  
Where nobody cries  
No one's getting out of here  
Dry county  
And no one's getting out of here

"A whiskey bottle comforts me  
And tells me not to cry  
While a full moon says a prayer for me  
I try to close my eyes  
  
But the night's there to remind me  
Of the guns and the early graves  
The ghosts appear as I fall asleep  
To sing an outlaw's serenade  
  
Dyin' ain't much of a livin'  
When you're livin' on the run  
Dyin' ain't much of a livin' for the young  
Is it too late to ask for forgiveness  
For the things that I have done  
Dyin' ain't much of a livin' for the young  
  
The desert's been a friend to me  
It covers me by night  
And a snakebite's not my enemy  
But it taught me how to fight  
  
All this fame don't bring you freedom  
Though it wears a this disguise  
When an outlaw is just a man to me  
And a man has to die  
  
Dyin' ain't much of a livin'  
When you're livin' on the run  
Dyin' ain't much of a livin' for the young  
Is it too late to ask for forgiveness  
For the things that I have done  
Dyin' ain't much of a livin' for the young  
  
And I hope someone will pray for me  
When it's my turn to die, pray for me  
  
Dyin' ain't much of a livin'  
When you're livin' on the run  
Dyin' ain't much of a livin' for the young

And the smiles they came easy cause of you  
You know that I love you, but I hate you

It might change the way you think  
There's no dancers, there's no diamonds  
No this boy he don't lip-synch  
  
[Chorus:]  
Here's the last man standing  
Step right up, he's the real thing  
The last chance of a lifetime  
Come and see, hear, feel, the real thing  
  
See those real live calloused fingers  
Wrapped around those guitar strings  
Kiss the lips where hurt has lingered  
It breaks the hart to hear him sing  
The songs were more than music  
They were pictures from the soul  
Se keep your pseudo-punk, hip-hop, pop-rock junk  
And your digital downloads  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Take your seats now, folks. It's showtime  
Hey, Patrick - hit the lights  
There's something in the air  
There's magic in the night  
Now here's the band, they really play  
I'll count the first one in  
I don't know where it's gone  
Well all know where it's been

The last man standing  
Step right up, he's the real thing

Would all just call in sick  
And the clouds would take the moon out

And the neighbor's dog don't bark like he used to  
Well - me, these days  
I just miss you - it's the nights that I go insane  
Unless you're coming back for me  
That's one thing I know that won't change  
  
It's hard, so hard - it's tearing out my heart  
It's hard letting you go

Gonna need a miracle  
'Cause your heart's doing time  
And your conscience is calling you out  
It ain't all for nothing  
Life ain't written in the sand  
I know the tide is coming  
But it's time we made a stand  
With a miracle

I used to believe but now it's just one day at a time  
The circus is gone, it's all packed away  
The clown's hat, the makeup's been packed in his case  
So we wave goodbye to Miss Fourth of July  
The queen of the roses has left us with nothing but thorns  
Don't say we never tried, Miss Fourth of July  
The stars that we reached for left us with nothing but dawn  
I used to laugh but I've learned to cry  
And I ain't too proud to let you see tears fall from these eyes  
For all of my hopes, my heartaches and fears  
For a night I just watched and you walked out of here  
I just waved goodbye to Miss Fourth of July  
The queen of the roses has left us with nothing but thorns  
Don't say we never tried, Miss Fourth of July  
The crown that we reached for left us with nothing  
But your thorns left me wounded not unlike the truth  
When innocence sang his last song  
He'd tell me that it's all gone  
Just look me in the eyes and say it meant nothing at all  
I used to live, I've learned to die  
And I used to dream, I used to dream  
So now we wave goodbye to Miss Fourth of July  
The queen of the roses has left us with nothing but thorns  
Don't say we've never tried, Miss Fourth of July  
The stars that we reached for, they've left us with nothing but dawn  
Oh yeah  
Nothing but a heavy hit of heartbreak  
A handful of blues  
Oh yeah

When I'm with you I see him in your eyes  
I want to hold you but I don't understand  
There's something there that's so hard to disguise

Those cold empty streets leave you wondering what's right  
As you walk away with your broken heart  
Don't you try to deny that true love had torn you apart

Never say die

On the gravestone where I'll lie  
Tell them it's just my bones  
That died there  
So save the tears they'll cry

Never say no

And it hurts just like hell to let go, but I know  
  
Kings will be kings with crowns to defend  
But I'm just one man and I can't pretend  
A heart's just a heart and songs have to end  
Dreams will be dreams and friends will be friends  
Now and forever, now and forever  
  
I still remember when you didn't know my name.  
We were lost on the road but you made it my home just the same,  
God I wanna say that you gotta hold on when we go our separate ways  
  
But when your radio's on, you're hearing this song  
I hope that you say nothing's changed

See my life going by, each moment I am alive  
I keep reaching out, holding on, hoping

"If you don't love her, you'd better let her go  
You'll never fool her, you're bound to let it show  
Love's so hard to take when you have to fake  
Everything in return, you just preserve her  
When you serve her a little tenderness  
If she's a woman, she'll try to make it last  
If you're a man now you'd better end it fast  
There's no reason here, no treason here  
Just the way a woman's mind, well she has no name  
She has no shame, she just loves you  
It's not easy to undo what's done  
Or to speak too freely to just anyone  
And if this takes more than you bargained for  
Boy it's time you learn, not to talk so loud  
Walk so proud when you're comin' on

"When I was a girl, my favorite thing  
In the whole wide world  
Was to see a field and  
Run for no reason  
And off I'd go, no one behind  
Only earth below  
Just a patch of green, green as the season  
Don't ask why, your feet just fly  
Green and sky is all that you're needin'  
  
Why ask why, when all that's true  
The sky is blue, blue for no reason  
Now that things have changed  
Everything's carefully prearranged  
Not a thing gets done  
Except for a reason  
Now I'm overrun, I'm startin' to feel  
Like a hired gun  
Where's the chance, where's the fun  
Where is the pleasin'?

And we'd been up many an hour  
And all through my brain  
Came the refrain  
Of home and its warming fire  
  
[Chorus]  
And Home  
Sings me of sweet things  
My life there has its own wings  
Fly over the mountain  
Though I'm standing still  
  
The people I've seen  
They come in between  
The cities of tiring life  
The trains come and go,  
But inside you know  
The struggle will soon be a fight  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Traveling at night,  
The headlights were bright.  
But soon the sun came through the trees  
Around the next bend  
The flowers will send  
The sweet smell of home in the breeze

There ain't no use in me trying to find out where you've been

"Broken heart, bloodshot stare  
Signs of a fool who cared too much  
Now she's gone and he can't remember how  
To live without her touch  
Hopin' to die but surely livin' to tell

He could swallow, he thought  
It was time to start lovin' again  
So he found someone  
Afraid his heart would follow the heat  
He could hardly do more than pretend  
Though she knew in her heart  
That his love was alive  
When it comes to matters of the heart  
There is nothing a fool won't get used to  
Now of all the things love teaches  
All the ways that it opens our eyes  
None more profound than the lesson he learned  
The day she walked out of his life  
Well when the road gets too narrow  
It's then he remembers her smile  
And he sees these words forming on her lips  
Across a river of tears he once cried  
When it comes to matters of the heart  
There is nothing, you won't get used to  
Ooh nothing a fool won't get used to

About all the love he let pass by.

To find where she's been hiding inside  
Broken or battered, it really doesn't matter  
Her heart's like a wave and he's the tide.  
  
They're not forever they're just for today

After winning but killing a man  
He's got all the moves and none of the courage  
Afraid to throw a punch that might land.  
  
Not too much later she can't meet his glance

Over and over like fire and ice

Why don't you say'em a prayer

They remember too much about what went wrong  
It might be they should learn to forget.  
  
Forget themselves in each other  
And leave what belongs in the past  
Carry their hearts like a newborn child  
Cause it's only the moment that lasts.  
  
They're not forever,they're just for today

He's fallin' for another,  
Found a new lover, and he won't be back again.

I've seen the look in his eyes  
He's in love and hypnotized.

There's already been a flood of my tears.  
Such a sense of loss tonight,  
Nought to do but ride it out.

To get over this heartbreak.

Winds on the coast tonight.  
We may get tossed tonight.

I knew behind my back they'd point and laugh and stare

Filled in my life  
She kept me on  
My best behavior  
She was my lord  
She was my savior  
  
She became my sanctuary  
Some place I could lay me down  
She would always help to carry  
All the things that weigh me down

How much I loved her  
Not even her  
Not even me

No one can lose when we turn the lights out  
Tastin' defeat, lovin' that sweet surrender  
  
I'm givin' up myself to you but I didn't really lose at all  
I gave the only love I've known and it never hurt me to fall

No more retreat, only my sweet surrender

For in this you're just like any other  
There's no need, no need to feel ashamed  
  
Take comfort where you see it  
Whatever makes it right  
Take comfort when you need it  
To help you through the night  
  
By the way we live in our confusion  
And the way that we misspend our youth  
By the time we're stripped of our illusions  
We may find illusions are the truth

"The silken skies that so remind and mesmerize  
And finally blind me  
The downy softness of herself forever lingering  
Behind me  
Never ever has there been  
Nor will ever be again  
One someone to give you love, tenderness and be  
Your friend  
Hanging on till the bitter end  
You can't measure the cost of a woman lost  
But it's a heavy loss indeed for those in need.  
  
I've tried to look inside myself  
To find the strength from which to draw from  
The view she saw from.  
Since she tried to go too deep  
Limitations brought her down  
And though I'd like to free her mind  
Visitations bring a frown  
I gotta find the place she found  
You can't measure the cost of a woman lost  
But it's a heavy loss to bear when she's not there.  
Where she is no one seems to know  
The silken skies have swallowed her up or so it seems.  
  
The morning mist that melts upon the meadow  
Brings a touch of sorrow  
The one I kissed is all alone  
And may or may not know tomorrow.  
Just an ordinary girl  
To the ordinary eye  
But so much deeper goes the vein  
Like the glittering of gold you want to touch  
Then you gotta hold  
You can't measure the cost of a woman lost.

If I was a sculptor, but then again, no  
Or a man who makes potions in a travelling show

My gift is my song and this one's for you  
  
And you can tell everybody this is your song  
It may be quite simple but now that it's done  
I hope you don't mind  
I hope you don't mind that I put down in words  
How wonderful life is while you're in the world  
  
I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss  
Well a few of the verses well they've got me quite cross  
But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song  
It's for people like you that keep it turned on  
  
So excuse me forgetting but these things I do  
You see I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue  
Anyway the thing is what I really mean  
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen

"Bill Horton was a cautious man of the road  
He walked lookin' over his shoulder and remained faithful to its code  
When something caught his eye he'd measure his need  
And then very carefully he'd proceed  
  
Billy met a young girl in the early days of May  
It was there in her arms he let his cautiousness slip away  
In their lovers twilight as the evening sky grew dim  
He'd lay back in her arms and laugh at what had happened to him  
  
On his right hand Billy tattooed the word love and on his left hand was the
word fear  
And in which hand he held his fate was never clear  
Come Indian summer he took his young lover for his bride  
And with his own hands built a great house down by the riverside  
  
Now Billy was an honest man he wanted to do what was right  
He worked hard to fill their lives with happy days and loving nights  
Alone on his knees in the darkness for steadiness he'd pray  
For he knew in a restless heart the seed of betrayal lay  
  
One night Billy awoke from a terrible dream callin' his wife's name  
She lay breathing beside him in a peaceful sleep, a thousand miles away  
He got dressed in the moonlight and down to the highway he strode  
When he got there he didn't find nothing but road  
  
Billy felt a coldness rise up inside him that he couldn't name  
Just as the words tattooed 'cross his knuckles he knew would always remain  
At their bedside he brushed the hair from his wife's face as the moon shone on
her skin so white  
Filling their room with the beauty of God's fallen light

As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sound

Flashing for the refugees on their unarmed road of flight  
And for each and every underdog soldier in the night  
We gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing

With faces hidden here while the walls were tightening  
As the echo of the wedding bells before the blowing rain  
Dissolved into the wild bales of lightning

Tolling for the luckless, the abandoned and forsaken  
Yeah tolling for the outcast, burning constantly at stake

As the hypnotic splattered mist was slowly lifting  
Well, electric light still struck like arrows  
Fired but for the ones condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting  
  
Well, tolling for the searching ones, on their speechless seeking trail  
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale  
And for each un-harmful gentle soul misplaced inside a jail  
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing  
  
Well, starry-eyed and laughing, I recall when we were caught  
Trapped by no track of hours for they hanged suspended  
As we listened one last time and we watched with one last look  
Spellbound and swallowed as the tolling ended  
  
Yeah, tolling for the aching ones whose wounds  
Cannot be nursed for the countless confused  
Accused, misused, strung out ones and worse  
And for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe

I had something going, mister, in this world

Our love went bad, times got hard  
Now I work down at the car wash  
Where all it ever does is rain  
Don't you feel like you're a rider on a downbound train  
  
She just said, ""Joe, I gotta go  
We had it once, we ain't got it anymore""  
She packed her bags, left me behind  
She bought a ticket on the Central Line  
Nights as I sleep, I hear that whistle whining  
I feel her kiss in the misty rain  
And I feel like I'm a rider on a downbound train  
  
Last night I heard your voice  
You were crying, crying, you were so alone  
You said your love had never died  
You were waiting for me at home  
Put on my jacket, I ran through the woods  
I ran till I thought my chest would explode  
There in the clearing, beyond the highway  
In the moonlight, our wedding house shone  
I rushed through the yard  
I burst through the front door, my head pounding hard  
Up the stairs I climbed  
The room was dark, our bed was empty  
Then I heard that long whistle whine  
And I dropped to my knees, hung my head and cried  
Now I swing a sledge hammer on a railroad gang  
Knocking down them cross ties, working in the rain  
Now, don't it feel like you're a rider on a downbound train

The earth it was windy, dark and cold

Right from the cheapest to the best  
Rode in on ponies made of skin and bones  
Keep up their rusty guns and went back home  
And the governor was sent down from population control  
And marshall all was past  
Riverboat gamblers put their money on faith  
For the time for hope they passed  
  
In the cold blue light of the desert night  
There was a thousand starry ships  
And men came down from still I don't now where  
With death on their fingertips  
Now there's no more kings in texas  
I swear they rounded up each and everyone

Reached from the rocky mountains into the old dead sun

And the moon slipped behind the clouds

As he walked by Billy stuck his knife into his pocket  
Took a breath and let him pass

Happy, darling, come the dark  
Happy when I taste your kiss

There's a house upon a distant hill  
Where you can hear the laughter of children ring  
Guardian angels, they watch from above  
Watching over the love that they bring  
But at night I feel the darkness near, I awake and I find you near  
I'm happy with you in my arms  
I'm happy with you in my heart  
Happy when I taste your kiss  
I'm happy in love like this  
  
In a world of doubt and fear  
I wake at night and reach to find you near  
Lost in a dream, you caught me as I fell  
I want more than just a dream to tell  
  
We're born in this world, darling, with few days and trouble never far behind  
Man and woman circle each other in a cage  
A cage that's been handed down the line  
Lost and running 'neath a million dead stars  
Tonight let's shed our skins and slip these bars  
Happy in each other's arms  
Happy, baby, come the dark  
Happy in each other's kiss  
I'm happy in a love like this

Now ever since we was young kids it's been the same come down

Man turns his back on his family well he just ain't no good  
  
Well Frankie went in the army back in 1965

There was a kid lyin' on the floor lookin' bad bleedin' hard from his head  
There was a girl cry'n' at a table and it was Frank, they said  
  
Well I went out and I jumped in my car and I hit the lights  
Well I musta done one hundred and ten through Michigan county that night  
It was out at the crossroads, down 'round Willow bank  
Seen a Buick with Ohio plates. Behind the wheel was Frank  
  
Well I chased him through them county roads  
Till a sign said ""Canadian border five miles from here""  
I pulled over the side of the highway and watched his tail-lights disappear

There were empty cities and burning plains

These days I spend my time skipping through the dark  
Through the empires of dust I chant your name  
Honey, I'm the hunter of invisible game  
  
Through the bone yard we rattled and black smoke we rolled on  
Down into the valley where the beast has his throne  
I sing my song and I sharpen my blade  
Honey, I'm the hunter of invisible game  
  
Strength is vanity and time is illusion  
I feel you breathing, the rest is confusion  
Your skin touches mine, what else to explain  
Honey, I'm the hunter of invisible game  
  
Now pray for yourself and that you may not fall  
When the hour of deliverance comes on us all  
When high hope and faith and courage and trust  
Can rise or vanish like dust and dust  
Now there's a kingdom of love waiting to be reclaimed

like dynamite  
He tried sellin' his heart to the hard girls over on Easy Street

And the pimps swung their axes and said, ""Johnny, you're a cheater""  
And the pimps swung their axes and said, ""Johnny, you're a liar""

Puerto Rican Jane, oh, won't you tell me, what's your name?  
I want to drive you down to the other side of town  
Where paradise ain't so crowded and there'll be action goin' down on Shanty

Pull .38's and kiss their girls goodnight  
  
Goodnight, it's alright, Jane

Like a late Juliet, she knew she'd never be true but then, she really didn't

Upstairs a band was playin' and the singer was singin' something about going
home  
She whispered, ""Spanish Johnny, you can leave me tonight, but just don't leave
me alone""  
And Johnny cried, ""Puerto Rican Jane, word is down, the cops have found the

Them barefoot boys left their homes for the woods  
Them little barefoot street boys, they said their homes ain't no good  
They left the corners, threw away their switchblade knives and kissed each
other goodbye  
  
Johnny was sittin' on the fire escape, watchin' the kids playin' down the
street  
He called down, ""Hey little heroes, summer's long, but I guess it ain't very
sweet around here anymore""  
Janey sleeps in sheets damp with sweat  
Johnny sits up alone and watches her dream on, dream on  
And the sister prays for lost souls, then breaks down in the chapel after
everyone's gone  
  
Jane moves over to share her pillow but opens her eyes to see Johnny up and
putting his clothes on  
She says, ""Those romantic young boys, all they ever want to do is fight

And the Magic Rat drove his sleek machine  
Over the Jersey state line  
Barefoot girl sitting on the hood of a Dodge  
Drinking warm beer in the soft summer rain  
The Rat pulls into town, rolls up his pants  
Together they take a stab at romance  
And disappear down Flamingo Lane  
  
Well, the Maximum Lawmen run down Flamingo  
Chasing the Rat and the barefoot girl  
And the kids 'round there live just like shadows  
Always quiet, holding hands  
From the churches to the jails  
Tonight all is silence in the world  
As we take our stand  
Down in Jungleland  
  
The midnight gang's assembled  
And picked a rendezvous for the night  
They'll meet 'neath that giant Exxon sign  
That brings this fair city light  
Man, there's an opera out on the Turnpike  
There's a ballet being fought out in the alley  
Until the local cops, Cherry-Tops, rips this holy night  
The street's alive as secret debts are paid  
Contacts made, they flash unseen  
Kids flash guitars just like switchblades  
Hustling for the record machine  
The hungry and the hunted  
Explode into rock 'n' roll bands  
That face off against each other out in the street  
Down in Jungleland  
  
In the parking lot the visionaries dress in the latest rage  
Inside the backstreet girls are dancing to the records that the DJ plays  
Lonely-hearted lovers struggle in dark corners  
Desperate as the night moves on  
Just one look and a whisper, and they're gone  
  
Beneath the city, two hearts beat  
Soul engines running through a night so tender  
In a bedroom locked in whispers  
Of soft refusal and then surrender  
In the tunnels uptown, the Rat's own dream guns him down  
As shots echo down them hallways in the night  
No one watches when the ambulance pulls away  
Or as the girl shuts out the bedroom light  
  
Outside the street's on fire in a real death waltz  
Between what's flesh and what's fantasy  
And the poets down here don't write nothing at all  
They just stand back and let it all be  
And in the quick of a knife, they reach for their moment  
And try to make an honest stand  
But they wind up wounded, not even dead  
Tonight in Jungleland

A lost cowboy at sundown  
Got my monkey on a leash  
Got my ear tuned to the ground  
  
My faith's been torn asunder  
Tell me is that rollin' thunder  
Or just the sinkin' sound  
Of somethin' righteous goin' under

border in search of a better life. Here I follow the journey backwards, from
the body at the river bottom, to the man walking across the desert towards the

For two days the river keeps you down

The turtles eat the skin from your eyes, so they lay open to the stars  
  
Your clothes give way to the current and river stone  
'Till every trace of who you ever were is gone  
And the things of the earth they make their claim  
That the things of heaven may do the same

I walk on sandals of twine and tire tread  
My pockets full of dust, my mouth filled with cool stone  
The pale moon opens the earth to its bones  
I long, my darling, for your kiss, for your sweet love I give God thanks

There's fifty-seven channels and nothin' on

We might'a got all nice and friendly if we'd made it upstairs  
All I got was a note that said "" bye-bye john

So I bought A. 44 magnum it was solid steel cast

"He lay his blanket underneath the freeway  
As the evening sky grew dark  
Took a sniff of toncho from his coke can  
And headed through Balboa Park  
Where the men in their Mercedes  
Come nightly to employ  
In the cool San Diego evening  
The services of the border boys  
  
He grew up near the Zona Norte  
With the hustlers and smugglers he hung out with  
He swallowed their balloons of cocaine  
Brought 'em across the Twelfth Street strip  
Sleeping in a shelter  
If the night got too cold  
Runnin' from the migra  
Of the border patrol  
  
Past the salvage yard 'cross the train tracks

There was X-man and Cochise  
Little Spider his sneakers covered in river mud  
They come north to California  
End up with the poison in their blood  
  
He did what he had to do for the money  
Sometimes he sent home what he could spare  
The rest went to high-top sneakers and toncho  
And jeans like the gavachos wear  
  
One night the border patrol swept Twelfth Street  
A big car come fast down the boulevard  
Spider stood caught in its headlights  
Got hit and went down hard  
As the car sped away Spider held his stomach  
Limped to his blanket 'neath the underpass  
Lie there tasting his own blood on his tongue  
Closed his eyes and listened to the cars

"Rainey Williams' playground was the Mott Haven streets where he ran past
melted candles and flower wreaths, names and photos of young black faces,
whose death and blood consecrated these places. Rainey's mother said, ""Rainey
stay at my side, for you are my blessing you are my pride. It's your love here
that keeps my soul alive. I want you to come home from school and stay
inside.""  
  
Rainey'd do his work and put his books away. There was a channel showed a
western movie everyday. Lynette brought him home books on the black cowboys of
the Oklahoma range and the Seminole scouts who fought the tribes of the Great
Plains. Summer come and the days grew long. Rainey always had his mother's
smile to depend on. Along a street of stray bullets he made his way, to the
warmth of her arms at the end of each day.  
  
Come the fall the rain flooded these homes, here in Ezekiel's valley of dry
bones, it fell hard and dark to the ground. It fell without a sound. Lynette
took up with a man whose business was the boulevard, whose smile was fixed in
a face that was never off guard. In the pipes 'neath the kitchen sink his
secrets he kept. In the day, behind drawn curtains, in Lynette's bedroom he
slept.  
  
Then she got lost in the days. The smile Rainey depended on dusted away, the
arms that held him were no more his home. He lay at night his head pressed to
her chest listening to the ghost in her bones.  
  
In the kitchen Rainey slipped his hand between the pipes. From a brown bag
pulled five hundred dollar bills and stuck it in his coat side, stood in the
dark at his mother's bed, brushed her hair and kissed her eyes.  
  
In the twilight Rainey walked to the station along streets of stone. Through
Pennsylvania and Ohio his train drifted on. Through the small towns of Indiana
the big train crept, as he lay his head back on the seat and slept. He awoke
and the towns gave way to muddy fields of green, corn and cotton and an
endless nothin' in between. Over the rutted hills of Oklahoma the red sun
slipped and was gone. The moon rose and stripped the earth to its bone.

To know just what I've got in this new thing I've found  
So tell me what I see  
When I look in your eyes  
Is that you baby  
Or just a brilliant disguise  
  
I heard somebody call your name  
From underneath our willow  
I saw something tucked in shame  
Underneath your pillow  
Well I've tried so hard baby  
But I just can't see  
What a woman like you  
Is doing with me  
So tell me who I see  
When I look in your eyes  
Is that you baby  
Or just a brilliant disguise  
  
Now look at me baby  
Struggling to do everything right  
And then it all falls apart  
When out go the lights  
I'm just a lonely pilgrim  
I walk this world in wealth  
I want to know if it's you I don't trust  
'Cause I damn sure don't trust myself  
  
Now you play the loving woman  
I'll play the faithful man  
But just don't look too close  
Into the palm of my hand  
We stood at the altar  
The gypsy swore our future was bright  
But come the wee wee hours  
Well maybe baby the gypsy lied  
So when you look at me  
You better look hard and look twice  
Is that me baby  
Or just a brilliant disguise  
  
Tonight our bed is cold  
Lost in the darkness of our love  
God have mercy on the man  
Who doubts what he's sure of

The worms in the barrel, the hanging sun  
Those first nervous evenings of perfume and gin  
The lost smell on your breath as I helped you get it in  
The rush of your lips, the feel of your name  
The beat in your heart, the devil's arcade  
  
You said ""Heroes are needed, so heroes get made""  
Somebody made a bet, somebody paid  
The cool desert morning and nothing to save  
Just metal and plastic where your body caved  
The slow games of poker with Lieutenant Ray  
In the ward with the blue walls, a sea with no name  
Where you lie adrift with the heroes of the devil's arcade  
  
You sleep and you dream, your buddies Charlie and James  
And wake with a thick desert dust on your skin  
  
Voice says ""don't worry, I'm here  
Just whisper the word tomorrow in my ear""  
House on a quiet street, a home for the brave  
A glorious kingdom with the sun on your face  
  
Rising from a long night as dark as the grave  
On a thin chain of next moments and something like faith  
On a morning to order a breakfast to make  
A bed draped in sunshine, a body that waits  
For the touch of your fingers, the end of the day  
  
The beat of your heart, the beat of your heart  
The beat of your heart, the beat of your heart  
The beat of your heart, the beat of her heart  
The beat of your heart, the slow burning away  
Of the bitter fires of the devil's arcade

When they built you, brother, they turned dust into gold  
When they built you, brother, they broke the mold  
  
They say you can't take it with you, but I think that they're wrong  
'Cause all I know is I woke up this morning, and something big was gone  
Gone into that dark ether where you're still young and hard and cold  
Just like when they built you, brother, they broke the mold  
  
Now your death is upon us and we'll return your ashes to the earth  
And I know you'll take comfort in knowing you've been roundly blessed and
cursed  
But love is a power greater than death, just like the songs and stories told  
And when she built you, brother, she broke the mold  
  
That attitude's a power stronger than death, alive and burning her stone cold  
When they built you, brother

"Princess cards she sends me with her regards  
Barroom eyes shine vacancy, to see her you gotta look hard  
Wounded deep in battle, I stand stuffed like some soldier undaunted  
To her Cheshire smile, I'll stand on file, she's all I ever wanted  
But you let your blue walls get in the way of these facts  
Honey, get your carpetbaggers off my back  
You wouldn't even give me time to cover my tracks  
You said, ""Here's your mirror and your ball and jacks""  
But they're not what I came for, and I'm sure you see that too  
  
[Chorus:]  
I came for you, for you, I came for you  
But you did not need my urgency  
I came for you, for you, I came for you  
But your life was one long emergency  
And your cloud line urges me  
And my electric surges free  
  
Crawl into my ambulance, your pulse is getting weak  
Reveal yourself all now to me, girl, while you've got the strength to speak  
'Cause they're waiting for you at Bellevue with their oxygen masks  
But I could give it all to you now, if only you could ask  
And don't call for your surgeon, even he says it's too late  
It's not your lungs this time, it's your heart that holds your fate  
Don't give me my money, honey, I don't want it back  
You and your pony face and your Union Jack  
Well, take your local joker and teach him how to act  
I swear I was never that way, even when I really cracked  
Didn't you think I knew that you were born with the power of a locomotive  
Able to leap tall buildings in a single bound?  
And your Chelsea suicide with no apparent motive  
You could laugh and cry in a single sound  
  
And your strength is devastating in the face of all these odds  
Remember how I kept you waiting when it was my turn to be the god?  
  
You were not quite half so proud when I found you broken on the beach  
Remember how I poured salt on your tongue and hung just out of reach  
And the band, they played the homecoming theme as I caressed your cheek  
That ragged, jagged melody, she still clings to me like a leech  
But that medal you wore on your chest always got in the way  
Like a little girl with a trophy so soft to buy her way  
We were both hitchhikers but you had your ear tuned to the roar  
Of some metal-tempered engine on an alien, distant shore  
So you left to find a better reason than the one we were living for  
And it's not that nursery mouth that I came back for  
It's not the way you're stretched out on the floor  
'Cause I've broken all your windows and I've rammed through all your doors  
And who am I to ask you to lick my sores?  
And you should know that's true

She crossed her legs and then  
We made some small talk, that's where it should have stopped  
She slipped me a number, I put it in my pocket  
My hand slipped up her skirt, everything slipped my mind  
In that little roadhouse On highway 29  
  
It was a small town bank, it was a mess  
Well I had a gun, you know the rest  
Money on the floorboards, shirt was covered in blood  
And she was cryin', her and me we headed south  
On highway twenty nine  
  
In a little desert motel, the air it was hot and clean  
L slept the sleep of the dead, I didn't dream  
I woke in the morning washed my face in the sink

The winter sun, shot through the black trees  
I told myself it was all something in her  
But as we drove I knew it was something in me  
Something had been comin' for a long long time  
And something that was here with me now  
On highway twenty nine  
  
The road was filled with broken glass and gasoline  
She wasn't sayin' nothin'', it was just a dream  
The wind come silent through the windshield  
All I could see was snow and sky and pines  
I closed my eyes and I was runnin',  
I was runnin' then I was flyin'

"Well Jesus was an only son  
As he walked up Calvary Hill  
His mother Mary walking beside him  
In the path where his blood spilled  
Jesus was an only son  
In the hills of Nazareth  
As he lay reading the Psalms of David  
At his mother's feet  
  
A mother prays, ""Sleep tight, my child, sleep well  
For I'll be at your side  
That no shadow, no darkness, no tolling bell,  
Shall pierce your dreams this night.""  
  
In the garden at Gethsemane  
He prayed for the life he'd never live,  
He beseeched his Heavenly Father to remove  
The cup of death from his lips  
  
Now there's a loss that can never be replaced,  
A destination that can never be reached,  
A light you'll never find in another's face,  
A sea whose distance cannot be breached  
  
Well Jesus kissed his mother's hands  
Whispered, ""Mother, still your tears,  
For remember the soul of the universe  
Willed a world and it appeared.""

Going down to Lucky Town  
I want to lose these blues I've found  
Down in Lucky Town  
Down in Lucky Town  
  
Had a coat of fine leather and snakeskin boots  
But that coat always had a tread hangin' loose  
Well I pulled it one night and to my surprise  
It led me right past your house and on over the rise  
  
I'm going down to Lucky Town

Now the joke's comin' up through the soles of my feet  
I been a long time walking on fortune's cane  
Tonight I'm steppin' lightly and feelin' no pain  
  
Well here's to your good looks baby now here's to my health  
Here's to the loaded places that we take ourselves  
When it comes to luck you make your own  
Tonight I got dirt on my hands but I'm building me a new home

"Cats in the Cradle  
By Harry Chapin  
  
A child arrived just the other day  
He came to the world in the usual way  
But there were planes to catch, and bills to pay  
He learned to walk while I was away  
And he was talking before I knew it and as he grew  
He said, ""I'm gonna be like you, Dad,  
You know I'm gonna be like you""  
  
And the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon  
Little boy blue and the man in the moon  
When you comin home, Dad, I don't know when,  
But we'll get together then,  
You know we'll have a good time then.  
  
My son turned ten just the other day  
He said ""Thanks for the ball, Dad, come on lets play  
Can you teach me to throw? "" I said, ""Not today,  
I got a lot to do"" He said ""that's okay""  
And he walked away but his smile never dimmed  
And said ""I'm gonna be like him, yeah  
You know I'm going to be like him""  
  
And the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon  
Little boy blue and the man in the moon  
When you comin home, Dad, I don't know when,  
But we'll get together then,  
You know we'll have a good time then.  
  
Well he came from college just the other day  
So much like a man I just had to say,  
""Son, I'm proud of you, can you sit for a while?""  
He shook his head, and he said with a smile  
  
""What I'd really like, Dad, is to borrow the car keys  
See you later, can I have them please? ""  
  
And the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon  
Little boy blue and the man in the moon  
When you comin home, Son, I don't know when,  
But we'll get together then, Dad  
You know we'll have a good time then.  
  
I've long since retired, my son's moved away  
I called him up just the other day  
I said ""Id like to see you if you don't mind""  
He said ""Id love to Dad, if I could find the time.  
You see my new jobs a hassle, and the kids have the flu.  
But It's sure nice talking to you, Dad,  
It's been sure nice talking to you........ ""  
And as I hung up the phone it had occurred to me  
He'd grown up just like me,  
My boy was just like me..............  
  
And the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon

Leapin and hoppin' on a moonshadow, moonshadow, moonshadow---

Blackbird has spoken like the first bird.

Praise for the morning,  
Praise for them springing fresh from the world.  
  
Sweet the rain's new fall, sunlit from heaven,  
Like the first dewfall on the first grass.  
Praise for the sweetness of the wet garden,  
Sprung in completeness where his feet pass.  
  
Mine is the sunlight,  
Mine is the morning,  
Born of the one light Eden saw play.

Stones crumbling under my feet I see smoke for miles around

Old man with his head down, can't see nothing more around, no

Came down on day when no-one was looking and it  
Stole away the land, people running scared, losing hands  
Dodging shadows of falling sand, buildings standing like empty shells  
And nobody...helping no-one else  
Young child with his hands high, ain't able to see no reason why, no

It is you who I wish to share my body with she said  
We'll find a dry place under the sky with a flower for a bed

Her hands were like the white sands, and her eyes had diamonds on.  
We left the road and headed up to the top of the Whisper Wood  
And we walked 'till we came to where the holy magnolia stood.  
And there we laid cool in the shade singing songs and making love  
  
With the naked earth beneath us and the universe above.

So while she was asleep I kissed her cheek for cheerio.  
  
The wedding took place and people came from many miles around  
There was plenty merriment, cider and wine abound  
But out of all that I recall I remembered the girl I met  
'Cause she had given me something that my hear could not forget.  
A year had passed and everything was just as it was a year before  
As if was a year before  
  
Until the gift that someone left, a basket by my door.  
And in there lay the fairest little baby crying to be fed,  
I got down on my knees and kissed the moon and star on his head.  
  
As years went by the boy grew high and the village looked on in awe  
They'd never seen anything like the boy with the moon and star before.

In their minds where thoughts are plotted  
Is also where crystal suns are forged  
  
And they will be older than a thousand years  
So that they may open the deserts of the heart  
And in these dreams of the mountain  
Friendship will surface

"Old days  
Good times I remember  
Fun days  
Filled with simple of pleasure  
Drive-in movies  
Comic books and blue jeans  
Howdy Doody  
Baseball cards and birthdays  
Please take me back  
To the world gone away  
Memories  
Seem like yesterday  
  
Old days  
Good times I remember  
Gold days  
Days I'll always treasure  
Funny faces  
Full of love and laughter  
Funny places  
Summer nights and streetcars  
Take me back  
To the world gone away  
Our good memories  
Seem like yesterday  
  
Old days.

"When I saw your face  
I could feel my heartbeat begin to race  
In the still of the night  
It was love at first sight  
  
Not too long ago  
I was on my own  
Never would have known  
You'd come into my life  
Now you're the love of my life  
  
[Chorus]  
Once in a lifetime  
Maybe the last time  
Just the right time to fall in love  
Once in a lifetime  
For such a long time  
I've been waiting for you  
  
You were there for me  
It was there for you  
We were meant to be  
Now we're fallin' in love  
Finally fallin' in love  
  
[Chorus]

"
"Do you love me  
Do you need me  
Tell me the truth tonight  
Do you love me  
Do you need me  
Can I still call you mine?  
  
I've heard the same old story  
So many times  
For every lie you've told me  
I'd be a rich man if I had a dime  
  
Why do you take me  
Why do you rake me  
Over your red hot coals  
Why do you scold me  
After you hold me  
Why do you turn so cold  
  
The lady's constant cruisin'  
Explains the tears  
The lonely path she's choosin'  
If I didn't love her would I still be here  
  
Hold on, stay with me  
Fantasies best left behind  
Hold on to love and just believe  
In love that won't bind you  
Don't leave me behind  
Stay with me baby  
  
Do you love me  
Do you need me  
Tell me the truth this time  
Do you love me  
Do you need me  
Can I still call you mine  
  
Soft lights and quiet music  
Forget your name  
Some people try to use it  
But loneliness chooses the rules to the game  
  
Please hold on, stay with me  
Tell me what you have in mind  
Please hold on, stay with me  
Baby, don't you leave me behind  
  
Please hold on, stay with me  
Loneliness will leave you blind  
Please hold on, stay with me  
Fall in love with me this time

"The way you talk  
The things you've done  
Make me wish I  
Was the only one  
Who  
Could ever have made you laugh now  
Could have made you  
Made you want want to cry  
To have been there the day  
You first whispered ""I love you""  
Yes I love you  
  
When you discover  
All those new things  
And when you first  
First met the world  
When you felt beautiful  
And you said hello(owowow)  
To everything you saw  
If I could have been all  
So I could have known you all those times  
I love you  
Yes, I love you  
Yes I do

"If the people only knew  
If they could visualize  
Just open their eyes  
Even stop to think about  
  
If they could open their minds  
They could get beyond  
The world's a funny place you know  
Most of what goes on  
  
Is rarely funny  
Rarely funny  
Could the people understand  
In only whisper and screams  
  
And colorless dreams  
Could they finally comprehend  
If they could suddenly see  
  
And suddenly feel  
The world's a funny place you know  
Most of what goes on  
Is rarely funny  
  
Rarely funny

The stars are shining bright  
I've not been feeling right  
Not been feeling right

Time to rearrange  
Stop this acting strange  
Found us a beautiful place  
Perfect time and space  
And now we can retrace  
Now we can retrace  
Now we can retrace  
All we have begun  
New oblivion

Got to get back inside

Save you from this crazy

Last chance to be free  
This mountain majesty  
This rediscovery

Please just let me in  
  
Though you're always out on the town  
I feel your loneliness  
While your life is leading you 'round  
It's just like an empty kiss

Well, it comes right down to you  
You've been givin' it up

Listen children, all is not lost,  
All is not lost, oh no, no,

Every day's the Fourth of July

"Six sets smoked on Saturdays  
At Barnaby's on State  
Countless California calls

We played the pier on Venice beach  
The crowd called out for more  
Zappa and the Mothers next  
We finished with a roar  
Jimi was so kind to us  
Had us on the tour  
We got some education  
Like we never got before  
Around the world in twenty days  
We played most every night  
Jet-lag, girls, strange languages  
Everyone began to fight  
Lowdown at the Caribou  
All rumours aside  
Was we could never get together  
Not unless we tried  
Summer with the Beach Boys  
We got sand all in our shoes  
Made some special music  
Everybody sang the blues

Won't you open your eyes

They're just not fair  
After all the good times and secrets we've shared

Getting up to splash my face  
Wanting just to stay awake  
Wondering how much I can take  
Should have tried to do some more

Are never all bad  
So try to find that little bit of good!  
  
Just a little, little bit of good

Hoping our dreams would come true  
Love was new  
Remember the house at the top of the hill  
How the sunlight caressed all the trees  
I played all my music I sang you my love  
The chiming church bells rode the breeze

Time has a way of obscuring our memories  
And good times are hard to recall  
Basic survival and day to day living  
Leaves no time for romance at all  
I just wanted to say I'm still falling in love  
Every day with you, every day  
Remember that Christmas with just a few friends  
And the whole town was covered with snow  
We laughed and we loved as we skied in the sun  
It seems such a long time ago  
Love was new  
Something you said one night started me thinking  
How sweet love is as it begins  
Taken for granted it slips through your fingers  
And leaves you on needles and pins  
But there ain't no way baby that we'd let that happen  
Our love will always be new

A crocodile phoned and reversed the charge  
Coming all the way from India on a local barge  
Ol' gorilla heard 'em talking in the lion's den  
But Jo Jo bet him three bucks the elephant wins  
Jo Jo yelled at Leo, Go on, knock him down  
He don't outweigh you but a thousand pounds  
Leo left wailin' with a left upper cut  
The elephant took his snoot and grabbed a coconut  
Leo fired a beautiful short back cross  
That's when the coconut landed up against his jaw  
Leo grew tired, but he wouldn't give in  
The elephant all loose, beat his jawbone in  
The buzzard said, they fought furious all day  
He couldn't understand how Leo got away  
Jo Jo runnin' everywhere, spreadin' the news  
To the zebras and the leopards and the kangaroos  
A hoot owl reported everything he saw  
Had his eyes wide open, they called it a draw  
Leo limping back with his jawbone bruised  
Jo Jo in the trees started singin' the blues  
Laughin', meddling, jumpin' up and down  
Till his foot missed a limb and he fell to the ground  
Just like a bolt of thunder and a streak of heat  
Leo covered Jo Jo with all four feet  
Jo Jo was screamin' with tears in his eyes  
Said, please mister Leo, I apologize  
Said, if you let my feet upon solid ground  
I'll fight you close range, fifteen rounds

You can walk down Beale Street, honey, wearing your pajamas  
You know home folks here, we let do just what you want to

"A stranger lying on a bar room floor  
Had drank so much he could drink no more,  
And so he fell asleep with a troubled brain  
To dream that he rode on that down bound train.  
  
The engine with blood was sweaty and damp  
And brilliantly lit with a brimstone lamp,  
And imps for fuel was shovelling bones  
While the furnace rang with a thousand groans.  
  
The boiler was filled with lots of beer  
The devil himself was the engineer,  
The passengers were most a motley crew,  
Some were foreigners and others he knew.  
  
Rich men and lost beggars in rags  
Handsome young ladies and wicked old hags.  
As the train rushed on at a terrible pace  
Sulphuric fumes scorched their hands and face,  
  
Wider and wider the country grew  
Faster and faster the engine flew,  
Louder and louder the thunder crashed  
Brighter and brighter the lighting flashed,  
  
Hotter and hotter the air became  
Til their clothes were burned with each quivering refrain.  
Then out of the din there came a yell  
Ha ha said the devil we're nearing home,  
  
Oh how the passengers shrieked with pain  
They go to Satan with this down bound train.  
The stranger awoke with an anguished cry  
His clothes wet with sweat and his hair standing high,  
  
He fell on his knees on the bar room floor  
And prayed a prayer like never before.  
And the prayers and vows were not in vain  
For he never rode that down bound train.

But when I'm gloomy just listen to me until it's all talked away  
  
Well, that's how it goes and Joe I know you're gettin' anxious to close

"I left my home in Norfolk Virginia,  
California on my mind.  
Straddled that Greyhound, rode him past Raleigh,  
On across Caroline.  
  
Stopped in Charlotte and bypassed Rock Hill,  
And we never was a minute late.  
We was ninety miles out of Atlanta by sundown,  
Rollin' 'cross the Georgia state.  
  
We had motor trouble it turned into a struggle,  
Half way 'cross Alabam,  
And that 'hound broke down and left us all stranded  
In downtown Birmingham.  
  
Straight off, I bought me a through train ticket,  
Ridin' cross Mississippi clean  
And I was on that midnight flier out of Birmingham  
Smoking into New Orleans.  
  
Somebody help me get out of Louisiana  
Just help me get to Houston town.  
There's people there who care a little 'bout me  
And they won't let the poor boy down.  
  
Sure as you're born, they bought me a silk suit,  
Put luggage in my hands,  
And I woke up high over Albuquerque  
On a jet to the promised land.  
  
Workin' on a T-bone steak a la carte  
Flying over to the Golden State,  
The pilot told me in thirteen minutes  
We'd be headin' in the terminal gate.  
  
Swing low sweet chariot, come down easy  
Taxi to the terminal zone,  
Cut your engines, cool your wings,  
And let me make it to the telephone.  
  
Los Angeles give me Norfolk Virginia,  
Tidewater four ten O nine  
Tell the folks back home this is the promised land callin'  
And the poor boy's on the line.

"My friend finally made a record and took to the road and played guitar  
He met this girl from Pennsylvania stuck by his side in love and war  
Fearful and fussy, but so faithful, poor and devoted, real and true  
She's not the type to be forsaken and I see much of her in you  
  
While on a gig up in Toronto during a pause between his show  
He met this foxy German stallion who understood him head to toe  
She played it smart and learned his weakness and made him confess and yield
into  
Her lustful whims became his fancy and I would fear the same from you  
  
Then in the swank suburbs of Houston off in a mansion built of stone  
Escorted by this wealthy widow into her lounge and left alone  
Her maid announced that she was waiting for him to come and rendezvous  
Where he bestowed a long relation one like I hope to have with you  
  
Then on the sands right off the ocean just as the sun sank in the sea  
So did my buddy slow and easy into a freak of fancy-free  
It was a group in automation getting together two by two  
Where people live and love one another, people who live like me and you  
  
Then on the beach in warm Miami there was a teacher far from school  
Taught him the way to please a woman, made him concede the Golden Rule  
He learned to do it unto others as he used to just have them do  
So they began to come together as I will try to do with you  
  
And there was one who was a virgin, never been touched by anyone  
She was as pure as any angel, in fact she's called to be a nun  
But it was all because my buddy just couldn't spoil a girl so true  
And so he left her as he found her, like I may have to do with you  
  
The girl he's got now, he's never left her, she was the first I thought he'd
shun  
Until I saw my buddy's eyes, when she came forth and bore his son  
Since then he's known no other woman, I think his ramblin' days are through  
They built a home up in the country, a life I'd love to build with you  
  
Although you've never known my buddy and I am sure he don't know you  
But you know the life he's living and all of the changes he's been through  
Sweetheart, I'm talking about my buddy 'cause I don't want to wind up blue  
I could be happy with you only 'cause I see all of them in you

That's when your leaving hurts me most  
The times when you would nestle to me  
And dwell within my heart so cold  
Although you stand two steps away now  
The distance seems from coast to coast  
  
I often think of when I met you  
Many times we kissed goodbye  
Sometimes I dream we are together  
Wake up moanin' your name thru sleepy eyes  
And I wanna scream that I still love you  
But you're not there, I got to realize  
  
It is now High Noon in China  
With the same stars up above  
The one I need has left me and gone now  
And all I have is a little picutre of  
The truest one I've ever known now  
Is the love I lost and still I love

Making new Christmas memories

If I had everything, it's true

I'm giving love for Christmas

And I feel lucky that my eyes could see  
People standing up and being  
Who they want to be  
People made the music  
And the music may them free  
  
Now I was just a baby through  
The summer of love they say  
But it still feels like it was yesterday  
And if the road gets rough  
I pick up my guitar and play  
  
It's always been right by my side  
To help me on my way

Now I don't need to worry 'bout tomorrow  
Ain't anticipating what's to come  
And I don't need to worry 'bout  
The things I have not done  
Long as I got rock and roll  
I'm forever young  
  
Now we can't always understand this world  
Farther along we'll understand it all  
The '70s looked like we all  
Were headed for a fall  
But those who listened hard enough  
Could hear the summer call  
  
Now I was growing up through all of this  
My first beer and love and my first kiss  
You never learn the things in school  
You learn by living and going through  
You taught me to be myself  
How can I thank you

Climbed the mountain and I reached for the sky

When you know it, it's alright  
So you put yourself between you and your pride  
If you wait for what's coming  
And you listen to her lies,  
Then she'll say the things you need to hear  
And the only one who'll disappear is you

"It's crowded in worship today

The girls' teasing laughter is carying farther than they know  
Farther than they know  
  
But if we are the body  
Why aren't His arms reaching  
Why aren't His hands healing  
Why aren't His words teaching  
  
And if we are the body  
Why aren't His feet going  
Why is His love not showing them there is a way  
There is a way  
  
A traveler is far away from home  
He sheds his coat and quietly sinks into the back row  
The weight of their judgemental glances tells him that his chances  
Are better out on the road  
  
But if we are the body  
Why aren't His arms reaching  
Why aren't His hands healing

And we are the body of Christ

Shackled to a heart that wants to settle  
And then runs away

Yeah, but she's alright with me  
  
She is leaving on a walkaway  
She is leaving me in disarray  
In the absence of a place to be  
She stands there looking back at me  
Hesitates, and then turns away  
She'll change so suddenly  
She's just like mercury  
Yeah, but she's alright with me  
  
Keep some sorrow in your hearts and minds  
For the things that die before their time  
For the restlessly abandoned homes  
The tired and weary rambler's bones  
And stay beside me where I lie  
She's entwined in me  
Crazy as can be  
Yeah, but she's alright with me

"Somebody screaming on Jim Jeffries' dreams  
Explode into a black fist and fall to the floor  
He stares up at the sky and he may wish he knew why  
But you can't go back there no more  
The future sounds so crazy, we all heard that song before  
Tomorrow's a name that changed from yesterday to blame  
When a train just don't stop here anymore  
  
I got starry eyed on a coaster ride  
Andy said, ""Man, I need a break from the world outside""  
And these days my life just careens through a pinball machine  
I could do so much better but I can't get off the tilt  
There's a photograph on a tv, black and white  
Andy says something to you  
Jack Johnson straddling Reno, Nevada like  
She says I forget myself sometimes, too  
  
But out past the doorways where we are sleeping  
Well, the white queen's creeping, the time cat's beeping  
  
Now I'm not breaking, the train's just shaking  
I never made it here before  
And there's a wide mouth spinning the girls around  
Till they can't take it any more  
I used to dream in the dark, in Palisades Park  
Up over the cliffs and down among the spark  
It's a long life full of long nights  
  
But it's not what I was waiting for  
Everybody's seen the horses driving down the shore  
It's a miracle they don't make them anymore  
  
So make up ladies, oh wake up baby  
You walked into the bar like some Saturday star  
Studs straight on spiked heels and needles and nerves  
And you're a downtown pride, fully amplified Clyde  
Gin-tied and Asian, but well preserved  
Remember Annie outside your bedroom window  
Saying, ""Come on, let's drive across to the Palisades""  
Keep going till we hit Reno, Nevada  
I don't see it all that much these days  
  
Still there are pages in back of the action stacks  
Where the white queen's creeping, the time cat's beeping  
  
The train's not breaking, the track's just shaking  
I never made it here before  
And there's a sky rocket turning the world around  
But still I can't take it any more  
And you carry that spark from Palisades Park  
Down over the cliffs and out into the dark  
It's a long life full of long nights  
  
But it's not what I was looking for  
Everyone dreams of horses flying round the shore  
It's a bad dream we're not having anymore

Andy said, ""Look at me, man, I'm cooking  
These hands are gonna figure out this whole world""  
He said, ""Come outside, climb out your bedroom window  
Shimmy down the fire escape and say goodbye  
Come outside, "" Andy says, ""I'm dressed up just like Edie  
Changing all the time, my leopard spots to polka dots, just say goodbye  
Come outside, where maybe we can move to California  
Just meet me at the subway and say goodbye  
Come outside, the cops all think we're crazy  
If you steal, you'll just get married  
To a girl who'll never know you and then say goodbye""  
  
Hey man, have you seen Andy?  
I lost her in the cirque  
I was high as a kite on a lovely and white  
Man, you can lose anyone  
Hey, hey man, have you seen Andy?  
I don't know where she's gone  
Real love outlives teenage lust  
Oh, we could get wet and it keeps us warm  
Love is like angel dust  
Lovely sometimes changes us  
  
Sometimes we're not  
Have you been aching with trust or just  
Have you been waking yourself with lust?  
Have you been making us up or just taking us home?  
  
It's a long wait and a long life  
Cars frozen in flight  
All the traffic stops to stare  
At a crosswalk in Reno, Nevada  
Where nothing but air and a pair of gray paper wings  
Andy thinks, ""Man, I have got nothing to wear""  
We got nothing to wear  
We got nothing to wear  
We got nothing to wear

"My friend assures me ""it's all or nothing""  
I am not worried, I am not overly concerned  
My friend implores me: ""For one time only make an exception""  
I am not not worried  
Wrap her up in a package of lies send her off to a coconut island  
I am not worried, I am not overly concerned  
With the status of my emotions ""Oh"", She says, ""You're changing.""  
  
But we're always changing  
It does not bother me to say this isn't love  
Because if you don't want to talk about it then it isn't love  
And I guess I'm going to have to live with that  
But, I'm sure there's something in a shade of grey or something in between  
And I can always change my name if that's what you mean  
  
My friend assures me ""It's all or nothing""  
But I am not really worried, I am not overly concerned  
You try to tell yourself the things you tell yourself to make yourself forget  
I am not worried  
""If it's love"", she said, ""then were gonna have to think about the  
consequences""  
She can't stop shaking and I can't stop touching her and.....  
  
This time when kindness falls like rain  
It washes her away and Anna begins to change her mind  
""These seconds when I'm shaking leave me shuddering for days"" she says  
And I'm not ready for this sort of thing  
  
But I'm not gonna break and I'm not going to worry about it anymore  
I'm not gonna bend and I'm not gonna break  
I'm not gonna worry about it anymore  
It seems like I should say ""as long as this is love...""  
But it's not all that easy so maybe I should just:  
Snap her up in a butter fly net and just pin her down on a photograph album  
I am not worried, I've done this sort of thing before  
But then I start to think about the consequences  
Because I don't get no sleep in a quiet room and...  
  
The time when kindness falls like rain  
It washes me away and Anna begins to change my mind  
And every time she sneezes I believe it's it's love and  
Oh lord.... I'm not ready for this sort of thing  
  
She's talking in her sleep  
It's keeping me awake and Anna begins to toss and turn  
And every word is nonsense but I understand and  
Oh lord... I'm not ready for this sort of thing  
  
Her kindness bangs a gong  
It's moving me along and Anna begins to fade away  
It's chasing me away  
She disappears and  
Oh lord, I'm not ready for this sort of thing

She makes a little motion with her head,  
Rolls over,

I've said ""I'm sorry"" to Maria for the cold hearted thing that I have done  
I've said ""I'm sorry"", by now, at least once to just about everyone  
She says, ""I've forgotten what I'm supposed to do today,""  
And it slips my mind what I'm supposed to say?  
We're getting older and older, and older  
And always a little further out of the way  
You look into her eyes and it's more than your heart will allow  
In August and Everything After, you get a little less than you expected,

I stumbled into Washington Square just as the sun began to rise  
I lay down on the lawn of the cathedral  
Right down with the shadow of St. Mary's in the sky  
And I'm just one of these late model children waiting for the king  
Yeah, but there ain't no sign of Elvis in San Fransisco  
It's just me, and I'm playing this rock and roll thing  
And She wants to be just like me  
And I want every damn thing I can see.  
One day you're Daddy's little angel,  
The next day you're everything he wanted you to be  
They dress you up in white satin  
And they give you your very own pair of wings  
In August and Everything After, I'm after everything.  
  
I said and la la la la...  
  
Well now I got my reservations and I got my seven million-dollar home  
And I got, I got the number of some girl in New York City  
Who's always wide awake so I never have to spend the night alone  
I got this nasty little habit of peeking down the shirts  
Of all the little girls as they pass me by  
And I wonder if it all catches up to me  
Do you think they'll take me down?  
Do you think I'm gonna cry?  
Well, I've already got your disease,  
So take your fucking filthy hands off of me  
Well I hope you weren't expecting me to be crucified,  
The best that they can do is just to hang me from the nearest tree  
  
It's midnight in san francisco,  
and I am waiting here for jesus on my knees  
in august and everything after  
I want somebody else to bleed for me  
I said la la la la... Na na....  
  
Well I came down from north dakota  
'cause I had confidence in the military mind  
and now, everyone I know is turning show girl  
and is dancing with their shirt off in some las vegas hotel line  
so I'm going to new york city 'cause it gotta little sleazy here for me  
when I find myself alone I know I'm never going home  
I make the changes the changes that I need  
but I no longer know how to pray  
and I'm living in A dog town and it's A dalmation parade  
I change my spots, over and over  
but they never seem to fade away

Threading the warm children  
Down the space between  
Into a slow heaven  
Hanging by a thread

To find my way out of here  
Out of the warm night, to the hard light  
Shivering with fear  
After you're gone, babies  
Crawling on the world  
Touching the souls of all the lonely  
Carefree boys and girls  
Daddy needs you  
Mamma feeds you  
And they come until they go  
But if I'm lonely, I'm the only one who knows  
It took so long  
To find my way out of here  
Out of the warm night, to the hard light  
Shivering with fear  
After the slow lonely waiting  
I'm all alone, alone and free  
If you see me, please believe me

Screaming at the rain  
Hanging a slow heaven

Sick of waiting

Please believe me  
I'm the only one who cares at all

Thought you'd realize, that I would know, I would show  
The special love I have for you, my baby blue  
What can I do, what can I say  
Except that I want you by my side  
How can I show, you, show me a way  
Don't you know, the times I tried (solo)  
Guess that's all I have to say,  
Except the feeling just gets stronger everyday  
Just one thing, before I go  
Take good care, baby, let me know, let it grow

Far behind

All this time  
Spinning round

Who draw the line  
Put your faith in the answers

She let out this morning  
Like a rusty shot in a hollow sky  
Left me without warning  
Sooner than the dogs could bark  
And faster than the sun rose  
Down to the banks in an old mule car  
She took a flatboat across the shallow  
Chorus:  
Left me in my tears to drown  
She left a baby daughter  
Now the water's wide and deep and brown  
She's crossing muddy waters  
Tobacco standing in the fields  
Be rotten come November  
And a bitter heart will not reveal  
A spring that love remembers  
When that sweet brown girl of mine her black eyes are ravens  
We broke the bread and drank the wine  
From a jug that she'd been saving  
Repeat chorus  
Baby's crying and the daylight's gone  
That big oak tree is groaning  
In rush of wind and river of song  
I can hear my sweetheart moaning  
Crying for her baby child  
Or crying for her husband  
Crying for that river's wild  
To take her from her loved ones

"Getting dressed and bunger bound  
Shuffling through the heather  
Neighbors drop their flowers down and worry about the weather

Every night I dream I'm under you  
All the smiling hands delivering all the ???  
All of the smiling men with suede hands delivering with those pensions  
Wont you please except our sympathy into three dimensions  
Every night I'M floating over you my love  
Every night I'm drifting under you  
Don't want to think about my last cigarette  
Don't want to focus on the curve of your thigh  
Don't want to slip off your white silhouette  
I don't think this is a very sensible way to die.

Lonely lonely lonely  
Lonely lonely lonely  
Lonely lonely lonely  
Every night I'M floating over you my love  
Every night I dream I'm under you  
Well I'm alter bound and under dressed  
Just slightly out of order hanging on the fringe of daylights  
Soft and pitchy border.  
Every night I'm floating over you my love  
Every night I'm slipping under you  
Every night I'm floating over you my love  
Every night I'm dream I'm under you  
Lonely lonely ohh I'M so lonely.

"(Original by Townes Van Zandt)  
  
Why does she sing  
Her sad songs for me,  
I'm not the one  
To tenderly bring  
Her soft sympathy  
I've just begun  
To see my way clear  
And it's plain,  
If I stop I will fall  
I can lay down a tear  
For her pain,  
Just a tear and that's all.  
  
What does she want me to do?  
She says that she knows  
That moments are rare  
I suppose that it's true  
Then on she goes  
To say I don't care,  
And she knows  
That I do  
  
Maybe she just has to sing, for the sake of the song  
And who do I think that I am to decide that she's wrong.  
  
She'd like to think that I'm cruel,  
But she knows that's a lie  
For I would be  
No more than a tool  
If I allowed her to cry  
All over me.  
  
Oh my sorrow is real  
Eventhough  
I can't change my plan  
If she could see how I feel  
Then I know  
That she'd understand  
  
Oh does she actually think I'm to blame?  
Does she really believe  
That some word of mine  
Can relieve  
All her pain?  
Can't she see that she grieves  
Just because she's been blindly deceived  
By her shame?  
  
Nothin's what it seems,  
Maybe she'll start someday  
To realize  
If she abandons her dreams,  
Then all the words she can say  
Are only lies  
When will she see  
That to gain  
Is only to lose?  
All that she offers me  
Are her chains,  
I got to refuse  
  
Oh but it's only to herself that she's lied  
She likes to pretend  
It's something that she must defend,  
With her pride  
And I don't intend  
To stand here and be the friend  
From whom she must hide

"All I want is something good  
It gets harder every time  
She is leaving here tonight  
Take a breath  
Take your time  
Spread your wings and rise  
  
Make a mark upon the wall  
Paint your face and pass the time  
Close your eyes and she ascends  
Hold your breath and ease your mind  
Forty Thousand times  
Time fades into the night  
  
They descend and then they climb  
Feathers falling through the night  
Have you seen Ohio rise?  
It has been four days and nights  
  
All I want is something fine  
It gets harder every time  
She is sleeping far away  
Take a breath  
Take your time  
Spread your wings and rise  
Rise into the black Ohio skies

"She had four white stallions coming up around the bend  
Four strong angels at her command to send  
Four more seasons, for all that's broken to mend  
  
I got four good reasons why I can't go back there again  
  
She had skin like a statue, milky white and pure  
Carved by an artist whose hand is demure  
Got a mind like a sabre  
Razor sharp and sure  
  
God how I hate myself for still wanting her  
  
Tell me it's nicer dreaming, visions soft and sure  
No way to find there's nothing left to me and her  
Nothing more but a heart still at war  
  
She had four white stallions coming up around the bend  
Four strong angels already sent  
Four more seasons for all that's broken to mend  
  
She had four more seasons wrong, broken to mend  
And I got four good reasons why I can't go back there again

"I took the cannonball down to the ocean  
Across the desert from sea to shining sea  
I rode a ladder that climbs across the nation  
Fifty million feet of earth between the buried and me  
  
""How do you do?""  
She said, ""Hey, how do you do?""  
  
She buys a ticket 'cause it's cold where she comes from  
She climbs aboard because she's scared of getting older in the snow  
Love is a ghost train rumbling through the darkness  
Hold on to me darling I've got nowhere else to go  
  
""How do you do?""  
She said, ""How do you do?""  
  
I took the cannonball down to the ocean

"Close the door on a short night  
Lift the lid on the daylight  
6: 09 West Tennessee time  
And I buy all my days  
  
At the same place where the girl sells her nights  
To a God of ocean tides.  
  
All night long,  
Writing poems to California  
Melodies of failure  
And the people I have thrown away  
Meanwhile, somewhere west of Carolina  
In a congregation of strangers  
We are digging holes to China  
Then we pray to our reflections  
In the water when it rises.  
  
I said headlights pin the highway down  
Jesus spins the world around  
And I'll spend all my tomorrows coming down  
Goodbye all my days.  
I know I said I never loved you  
But I might just try again tonight.  
  
Truck stops and river Gods  
Gas stations of the Cross  
Following a ghost,  
Following a ghost,  
I pray the water wash away  
The memories and the cost.  
  
Cary me south, to the sea  
Along with your memories of me  
We are born in the water  
Now we return to Thee.  
Colored lights  
And birthday cakes  
Candle wax  
On paper plates.  
  
Breathe the water  
Hush-a-bye, hush-a-bye.  
You can see through water  
All the way up to the sky.  
  
Gods of water, Gods of rain  
Cover up the sun again  
We are crossing it at the Mississippi line  
And I tried all my days  
To love you just the way you hoped I might,  
But I'm leaving here tonight.  
I can't remember yesterday  
I tried, if I said I could I lied.

"Well I feel just like a freight train baby,  
Running out of steam.  
I wanna go on down to New York town,  
But I'm stuck in between.  
And I could stay on here at home alone  
And have myself to thank,  
But I just made a billion dollars  
And I don't wanna put it in the bank,  
So if you call...  
We could go to town.  
Well dear mom,  
If you could see me now here underneath the lights  
I gotta keep 'em on from dusk to dawn  
And everything's alright.  
I met a girl with autumn in her eyes  
And summer in the way  
She makes me feel  
Like I was only born today or yesterday,  
And if she calls...  
We could go to town.  
But everybody here  
Hates everything I say,  
And girl I just don't know  
If I can last another day.  
So I guess I'm going back,  
Back where I belong,  
I hope you come along  
Before I get back on that train that takes me...  
Home from New York City  
To the things I left behind  
And 'though I ain't got no money girl  
, I'll always have the time.  
But I wish that you would hurry,  
I hope you get here soon  
'cause I just sold the sky to the sun  
So I could buy for you the moon.  
And if you call...  
We could go to town. So if you call...  
Yeah, if you call...

Feels warm on my face today

"On certain Sundays in November  
When the weather bothers me  
I empty drawers of other summers  
Where my shadows used to be  
And she is standing by the water  
As her smile begins to curl  
In this or any other summer  
She is something altogether different  
Never just an ordinary girl  
  
And in the evenings on Long Island  
When the colors start to fade  
She wears a silly yellow hat  
That someone gave her when she stayed  
I didn't think that she returned it  
We left New York in a whirl  
Time expands and then contracts  
When you are spinning in the grip of someone  
Who is not an ordinary girl  
  
And when you sleep you find your mother in the night  
But she stays just out of sight  
So there isn't any sweetness in the dreaming  
And when you wake the morning covers you with light  
And it makes you feel alright  
But it's just the same hard candy you're  
remembering again  
  
You send your lover off to China  
And you wait for her to call  
You put your girl up on a pedestal  
Then you wait for her to fall  
I put my summers back in a letter  
And I hide it from the world  
All the regrets you can't forget  
Are somehow pressed upon a picture  
In the face of such an ordinary girl  
  
And when you sleep you find your mother in the night  
But she fades just out of sight  
So there isn't any sweetness in the dreaming

The morning showers you with light

Someone stole my shoes  
But there's a couple of bananas  
And a bottle of booze  
  
Oh well, happy new year's baby!  
We could probably fix it if we clean it up all day  
Or we could simply pack our bags  
And catch a plane to Barcelona 'cause this city's a drag  
  
I may take a holiday in Spain  
Leave my wings behind me  
Flush my worries down the drain  
And fly away to somewhere new

Leave my wings behind me  
Drive this little girl insane  
Fly away to someone new  
Fly away to someone new

"[Verse:]  
I snook out the front door into winter and the world outside  
I stepped out the door to New York City, my hair was barely dry  
I could not remember where I was going, so I went back inside  
Nothin' happened in the elevator, nothing happening on the stairs  
Nothing ever happenin' when I am sleeping and I cannot stay there  
How'd you find a party when you're in your room?  
How'd you find the action man? The action is everywhere!  
And decide to climb outside your bedroom window, paint a picture on a clock  
Oh if you decide that you can't hide inside your mind  
Provide the slide to get you out  
Feels just like you're fallin' and you're goin' down  
And everybody luvs ya when you hit the ground  
I say a prayer, I say a prayer, I say a prayer to Pocahontas  
I pray to John Appleseed  
Oh, I cigarette the winter air, then I finna stare my way down 7th street  
Some chick yells Jesus luvs me more than I know but less than I need  
I play down the valley to the? And then I step off into the air  
Point my sunglasses east towards Jerusalem and then follow all the pharoahs
there  
They're buildin' pyramids in the Western Square  
Drivin' in circles 'round the circus til the circles in the air  
My love says come on Adam tell me what the hell is wrong with you  
She says, come on, Adam tell me, what the hell am I supposed to do!  
She says I could love you, I could leave you  
But I can't live what you put me through  
I call the winter Maria cuz I do not know her face  
I call the endless sky Emilia cuz she stays with me from place to place  
I call the sun my love Emanuel, she cradle me in her embrace  
I left, nothin' happening in the kitchen, nothing happening on the floor  
Nothin' happenin' in my bed, she don't sleep there no more  
Hard to find the bottom when you're in the air  
Hey man, how'd you find the circus, we have the circus is everywhere?

And the price of a memory is the memory of the sorrow it brings  
And there is always one last light to turn out and one last bell to ring  
And the last one out of the circus has to lock up everything  
  
Or the elephants will get out and forget to remember what you said  
And the ghosts of the tilt-a-whirl will linger inside of your head  
And the ferris wheel junkies will spin them forever instead  
When I see you a blanket of stars covers me in bed  
  
Hey Mrs. Potter don't go  
Hey Mrs. Potter I don't know but  
Hey Mrs. Potter won't you talk to me  
  
All the blue light reflections that color my mind when I sleep  
And the lovesick rejections that accompany the company I keep  
All the razor perceptions that cut just a little too deep  
Hey I can bleed as well as anyone, but I need someone to help me sleep  
  
So I throw my hand into the air and it swims in the beams  
It's just a brief interruption of the swirling dust sparkle jet stream  
Well, I know I don't know you and you're probably not what you seem  
But I'd sure like to find out  
So why don't you climb down off that movie screen  
  
Hey Mrs. Potter don't turn  
Hey Mrs. Potter I burn for you  
Hey Mrs. Potter won't you talk to me  
  
When the last king of Hollywood shatters his glass on the floor  
and orders another  
Well, I wonder what he did that for  
That's when I know that I have to get out cause I have been there before  
So I gave up my seat at the bar and I head for the door  
  
We drove out to the desert just to lie down beneath this bowl of stars  
We stand up at the Palace like it's the last of the great Pioneertown bars  
We shout out these songs against the clang of electric guitars  
You can see a million miles tonight  
But you can't get very far  
  
Hey Mrs. Potter I won't touch and  
Hey Mrs. Potter it's not much but  
Hey Mrs. Potter won't you talk to me

"My love  
Lives out at the end of the road  
Takes what you give her and goes

There was a call at 3 A. M. At jfk  
Guess you stayed cuz you wanted to stay

And then Kennedy took you away

And the moments that make up your life till you wake up  
You sit on a swing in the dark with a girl  
She tells you she wanted to kiss you

The worst part of a good day  
Is hearing yourself say goodbye  
To one more possibility day, goes on, and on

But you're scared, and mistaken for strange  
You want me to leave then you start to believe  
I should stay, I gotta get out of la  
It seems that the short days are over  
Cause you don't just don't sleep in the daylight  
So I don't sit up nights  
I lay on my back on top of the hill  
And your body is breaking the sky cuz you're shakin'

Me and you, we know too many reasons for people  
And season that pass like they weren't even here  
Now living in smiles is better you say  
We carry the burdens of all of our days  
So scared that you'll leave, you're scarred that I'll stay  
It's an impossibility day, we only saw half of the ballet  
I said good night, goodbye, seems like a good thing  
So you know it's a good lie  
You can run outta choices and still hear  
A voice in your head when you're lying in bed  
And it says that the best part of a bad day is knowing it's okey  
The color of everything changes the sky rearranges it's shade  
And the smile doesn't fade into the phone call and one bad decision we've made

And the worst part of a good day  
Is the one thing you don't say  
And you don't know how but you  
Wish there was some way so  
  
[Verse 4:]  
And you pull down the shades and you shut out the light  
Because somehow you mixed up, goodbye and good night  
And you one thing you won't say is everyone  
Knows possibility days are impossible  
It just feels wrong, so wrong, still you're gone, long gone

She tells herself that this will be the last time  
Then Mary Jane pulls her hair back and wonders  
What she'll do with all her free time  
  
Not too far from here  
Mary turns to go  
Smiling while the waltz begins  
Dancing down the road  
  
Hey, hey, hey, hey, Mr. Freedom  
What are we supposed to think?  
'Cause I'm a very tiny person and it worries me  
  
I'm all alone again and  
I like what she says but not what it means  
She leaves me drowning  
In the shallow days way down below  
  
""I'm sorry"", she said  
""I know it's not the kind of thing you want""  
I'm falling, falling down  
""I'm sorry"", she said  
""I know I'm not the kind of girl you want""  
We're falling, falling, falling, falling down

"(Original by Robyn Hitchcock)  
  
I used to ring you and put down the phone,  
Once wore a hole in your dress.  
Even tried Voodoo outside your home,  
But these days I couldn't care less.  
  
She doesn't exist any more,  
She doesn't exist any more.  
I let her go like the fool that I was,  
Thought I'd get over her soon.  
I smell her perfume when my eyes are closed,  
And I see her face in the moon.  
She doesn't exist any more,  
She doesn't exist any more.  
I tell myself it would be different now,  
I wouldn't treat her that way.  
I wouldn't be me if she wasn't her,  
And it's far too late, anyway.  
'Cause she doesn't exist any more,  
She doesn't exist any more.  
Only inside you the ghost of the love,  
That is wordless and painful and old.  
There's no one else in the whole outside world,  
That matches to her in your soul.  
But she doesn't exist any more,  
She doesn't exist any more.

When we were at the movie theatre watching harry potter

With a sign that read 'will work for food'  
Tried to look busy, 'til the light turned green  
  
I saw a bear on TV and his friends were all drowning  
Cause their homes were turning to water  
  
A strange, kinda sad, big old bear  
Surely would happily eat me  
He'd tear me to pieces that bear  
  
Wake up sleepy head  
I think the suns a little brighter today  
Smile and watch the icicles melt away and see the water rising...  
Summers here to stay, and all those summer games will last forever  
Go down to the shore, kick off your shoes, dive in the empty ocean.  
  
Tell me everything will be OK if I just stay on my knees and keep praying  
Believing in something  
Tell me everything is all taken care  
Of by those qualified to take care of it all  
  
Wake up sleepy head  
I think the suns a little brighter today  
Smile and watch the icicles melt away and see the waters rising  
Summers here to stay, and that sweet summer breeze will blow forever  
Go down to the shore, kick off your shoes, dive in the empty ocean  
  
One day, do you think we'll wake up in a world on it's way to getting better?  
And if so can you tell me  
How?  
  
I have been thinking that lately the blood is increasing  
The tourniquets not keeping hold in spite of our twisting  
Though we would like to believe we are  
We are not in control  
Though we would love to believe  
  
Wake up sleepy head

"Once upon a time  
When the world was just a pancake  
Fears would arise  
That if you went too far you'd fall  
But with the passage of time  
It all became more of a ball.  
We're as sure of that  
As we all once were when the world was flat

As life billows smoke inside my head  
This little game where nothing is sure, oh  
Why would you play by the rules?

Were true enough but still  
What is all the worrying about  
When you can work it out  
When you can work it

So you lay your arms down

Those hands once warmed here  
I have retired them  
I can breathe my own air

Don't wanna die like a little dog.  
Well, I eat what I can get,  
From the monkey man.  
Great, great monkey man.

Cross the ice,  
Melts too quickly for us to reach the other side.

But the sun shines bright.  
Oh, it warms this up well,  
Oh, the tide is rising higher.  
  
Look, it's strange,  
Floating by.  
Looks just like the ones,  
That flow out and ride, oh, I will.

Our golden days seem to have us,  
Hypnotized or blind, well.

So troubled and doubling my pain

I wish I could climb inside your mind  
And spend some time and hug and hold you  
And mold you into what I'd like  
But no I can't do this  
Just a kiss to spend a while by you  
And your familiar smile and voice  
  
I lay awake  
Then you lean back and smiling  
On you  
Most everything you do for me, I say  
And the while let's make our way  
And feel warm  
In the middle of this storm with you  
Like an angel  
  
Oh, what the friends say is good, is right  
I say  
When you were again  
And you were my friend  
Before the lie  
This one  
Say yes I do  
And with you  
Sometimes  
  
But while I do my best  
With all the rest I leave to you  
Can't wait for the hour  
And when two things become this  
All this trouble from a kiss from you, I'll do it  
And when you come up smiling  
And I'm thrown  
Into I get a little storm with you, I'll do it  
  
Always  
Lover, line up and yeah  
The road to you is long and I've been on it for a while  
And a need a warm embrace

The old man said to me  
Long before these crowded streets  
Here stood my dreaming tree  
Below it he would sit  
For hours at a time  
Now progress takes away  
What forever took to find  
And now he's falling hard  
He feels the falling dark  
How he longs to be  
Beneath his dreaming tree  
Conquered fear to climb  
A moment froze in time  
When the girl who first he kissed  
Promised him she'd be his  
Remembered mother's words  
There beneath the tree  
No matter what the world  
You'll always be my baby  
Mommy come quick  
The dreaming tree has died  
The air is growing thick  
A fear he cannot hide  
The dreaming tree has died  
  
Oh  
Have you no pity  
This thing I do  
I do not deny it  
All through this smile  
As crooked as danger  
I do not deny  
I know in my mind  
I would leave you now  
If I had the strength to  
I would leave you up

Will you not talk  
Can you take pity  
I don't ask much  
But won't you speak  
Please

She knew she had it made  
Easy up 'til then  
For sure she'd make the grade  
Adorers came in hordes  
To lay down in her wake  
She gave it all she had  
But treasures slowly fade  
Now she's falling hard  
She feels the fall of dark  
How did this fall apart  
She drinks to fill it up  
A smile of sweetest flowers  
Wilted so and soured  
Black tears stain the cheeks  
That once were so admired  
She thinks when she was small  
There on her father's knee  
How he had promised her  
You'll always be my baby  
Daddy come quick  
The dreaming tree has died  
I can't find my way home  
There is no place to hide  
The dreaming tree has died

"Hoping for a new beginning

When we are all old and gray  
And this time that we've spent together  
Was well worth our wait  
Think of the fun that we had  
Not caring until the next morning  
It feels so good to go through life  
With your eyes half open  
  
We are all one and the same  
We are lovers, and brothers, and sisters  
And most of all friends  
  
These years have passed us by so fast  
It seems like we never got the chance  
To realize how good life really was  
And let the moment last  
And it feels like it was only yesterday  
When we walked into this place  
And said I can't wait till I get out of here  
And now as we walk down this aisle  
With four years all rolled up in a scroll, you can't help but think  
Hey, Where did the time go  
  
We are all one and the same  
We are lovers, and brothers, and sisters  
And most of all friends  
Hold on to your memories  
Hold on to those little things  
And I hope you receive as much as you get  
Cause when you die they're the only things  
That you can take to your grave  
  
These are the days of your life  
And don't let them pass you by  
Cause you never know when you might take your last breath  
And so take a deep one tonight  
  
Good friends we had along the way  
And good friends that didn't make it to where we stand today  
But we all know that they're looking down on us  
And even though their lives were cut short  
We still remember the little thing that made us laugh about them  
And do you remember when and where did you meet them?  
  
We are all one and the same  
We are lovers, and brothers, and sisters  
And most of all friends  
Hold on to your memories  
Hold on to those little things  
And I hope you receive as much as you get  
Cause when you die they're the only things  
That you can take to your grave

Where we all will go our separate ways  
So go hug and kiss your friends

"So I'm leaving...  
This warehouse frightens me.  
Has me tied up in knots,  
Can't rest for a moment.  
  
Soon I'm going...  
I'm slipping slow away  
Hoping to find something better than  
I've got inside here  
And the warehouse slips away...

Don't throw away your playful beginning  
You and I will fumble around in the touches  
And be sure to...  
  
Leave all the lights on  
So we can see the black cat changing colors  
And we can walk under ladders  
And swim as the tide turns you around and around  
  
Hey we have found  
Becoming one in a million  
Slip into the crowd  
This question I found in the gap in the sidewalk  
  
Keep all your sights on  
The black cat changing colors  
We can walk under ladders  
And swim as the tide choose to turn you  
  
And here I sit  
Life goes on, end of tunnel, TV set  
Spot in the middle  
Static fade, statistic bit  
And soon I'll fade away, I'll fade away  
  
This I admit  
Taste so good, hard to believe an end to it  
Smell touch feel  
How could this rhythm ever quit  
Bags packed on a plane  
Hopefully to heaven  
  
Shut up I'm thinking  
I had a clue now it's gone forever  
Sitting over these bones  
You can read in whatever you're needing to  
  
Keep all your sights on  
The big bad black cat that's  
Changing colors  
  
It's not the colors that matter  
But that they'll all fade away  
  
This I admit  
Seems so full  
Hard to believe an end to it  
Warehouse is bare  
Nothing at all inside of it  
Walls and halls have disappeared, they've disappeared  
  
My love I love to stay here  
My love I love to stay here  
My love I love to stay here  
My love I love to stay here  
In a corner was wondering...  
If a change could be better than this  
And then I worry  
Maybe things won't be better than they have been here  
Here in the warehouse  
  
At the warehouse  
How I love to stay here  
At the warehouse  
Every man and woman get alive  
  
That's our blood down there  
Seems poured from the hands of angels  
But trickle into the ground  
Leaves the warehouse bare and empty  
  
My heart's numbered beat  
Still echo in this empty room  
Fear wells in me  
But nothing seems enough to defend  
So I am going away...

I love you more each day (I love you more each day...)  
  
Never though never cross my mind  
You gave everything You ask me just holding on  
If I could just walk away  
To love again with somebody new

Showering a desert stone  
Wash away these tears of yesterday

Sung by the angels

Somebody blew the whistle and the walls are closing down  
There's a meeting in the boardroom they're trying to trace the smell  
There's leaking in the washroom there's a stinking personnel  
Somewhere in the corridors someone was heard to sneeze

The caretaker was crucified for sleeping at his post  
They're refusing to be pacified it's him they blame the most  
The watchdog's got rabies the foreman's got fleas

There's panic on the switchboard tongues are in knots  
Some come out in sympathy some come out in spots  
Some blame the management some the employees  
Everybody knows it's the Industrial Disease  
  
The work force is disgusted downs tools and walks  
Innocence is injured experience just talks  
Everyone seeks damages and everyone agrees  
That these are 'classic symptoms of a monetary squeeze'  
On ITV and BBC they talk about the curse  
Philosophy is useless, theology is worse  
History boils over there's an economics freeze  
  
Sociologists invent words that mean 'Industrial Disease'

They want to have a war to keep us on our knees  
They want to have a war to stop us buying Japanese  
They want to have a war to stop Industrial Disease  
They're pointing out the enemy to keep you deaf and blind  
They want to sap your energy, incarcerate your mind  
They give you Rule Brittania, gassy beer, page three  
Two weeks in Espana and Sunday striptease'  
Meanwhile the first Jesus says 'I'd cure it soon  
Abolish Monday mornings and Friday afternoons'  
The other one's out on hunger strike he's dying by degrees

And I bet and you exploded in my heart

When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong, Juliet?

Both dirty both mean yes and the dream was just the same  
And I dreamed your dream for you and now your dream is real  
How can you look at me as if I was just another one of your deals?  
  
Well you can fall for chains of silver you can fall for chains of gold  
You can fall for pretty strangers and the promises they hold  
You promised me everything you promised me thick and thin, yeah  
Now you just say oh Romeo yeah you know I used to have a scene with him  
  
Juliet when we made love you used to cry  
You said I love you like the stars above I'll love you till I die  
There's a place for us you know the movie song  
When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong Juliet?  
  
I can't do the talk like they talk on TV  
And I can't do a love song like the way it's meant to be  
I can't do everything but I'd do anything for you  
I can't do anything except be in love with you  
  
And all I do is miss you and the way we used to be  
All I do is keep the beat and bad company  
All I do is kiss you through the bars of a rhyme  
Juliet I'd do the stars with you any time  
  
Juliet when we made love you used to cry  
You said I love you like the stars above I'll love you till I die  
There's a place for us you know the movie song  
When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong Juliet?

"A long time ago came a man on a track  
Walking thirty miles with a sack on his back  
And he put down his load where he thought it was the best  
He made a home in the wilderness  
He built a cabin and a winter store  
And he plowed up the ground by the cold lake shore  
And the other travelers came walking down the track  
And they never went further, and they never went back  
Then came the churches, then came the schools  
Then came the lawyers, and then came the rules  
Then came the trains and the trucks with their loads  
And the dirty old track was the telegraph road  
  
Then came the mines, then came the ore  
Then there was the hard times, then there was a war  
Telegraph sang a song about the world outside  
Telegraph road got so deep and so wide  
Like a rolling river  
  
And my radio says tonight it's gonna freeze  
People driving home from the factories  
There's six lanes of traffic  
Three lanes moving slow  
  
I used to like to go to work, but they shut it down  
I've got a right to go to work, but there's no work here to be found  
Yes, and they say we're gonna have to pay what's owed  
We're gonna have to reap from some seed that's been sowed  
And the birds up on the wires and the telegraph poles  
They can always fly away from this rain and this cold  
You can hear them singing out their telegraph code  
All the way down the telegraph road  
  
You know, I'd sooner forget, but I remember those nights  
When life was just a bet on a race between the lights  
You had your head on my shoulder, you had your hand in my hair  
Now you act a little colder, like you don't seem to care  
But believe in me, baby, and I'll take you away  
From out of this darkness and into the day  
From these rivers of headlights, these rivers of rain  
From the anger that lives on the streets with these names  
'Cause I've run every red light on memory lane  
I've seen desperation explode into flames  
And I don't want to see it again  
  
From all of these signs saying, ""sorry, but we're closed""  
All the way  
Down the telegraph road

Greasy hair easy smile

You and me we can't beat

The deejay he say here's Mandy for ya  
I feel alright to see her

She's dancing high I move on by

Throw down a rope from heaven  
And lead the flock to water  
The man in the middle would have you think  
That you have no other choice  
But to wander in the wilderness  
Of all the upturned faces  
If you stop and listen long enough  
You will hear your own small voice  
  
But you don't have to pray to a little tin god  
Step out of the way for a little tin god

Still you angle for your case  
Like you wouldn't know a burning bush

When just a simple reaching out  
Might build a bridge that lasts

On that broad highway somewhere  
To lift you high

He mounts his misinformed attack  
He wears the clothes of a dissenter  
But there's a logo on his back  
And it's a hollow rebellion  
As rebellions mostly are  
It's just another raging tempest in a jar  
  
And the seasons keep on changing  
And the wind blows hot and cold  
Wish that you were here with us to watch this tide  
As it ebbs and flows  
Damn it, Rose

Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air.  
Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light.  
My head grew heavy, and my sight grew dim, I had to stop for the night.  
There she stood in the doorway,  
I heard the mission bell.  
And I was thinking to myself,  
This could be Heaven, or this could be Hell.  
Then she lit up a candle, and she showed me the way.

She's got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, that she calls friends.  
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat,  
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget.  
So I called up the Captain, ""Please bring me my wine.""  
He said ""We haven't had that spirit here since 1969.""

And she said ""We are all just prisoners here,  
Of our own device.""  
And in the master's chambers, they gathered for the feast,  
They stab it with their steely knives, but they just can't kill the beast.  
Last thing I remember, I was running for the door,  
I had to find the passage back to the place I was before.

He fought the bull...and they fought once more  
When they found the matador and saw him dying  
He'd never see tomorrow  
Now they say that on the spot where he was lying
