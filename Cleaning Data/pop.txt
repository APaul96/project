You've got to stay and hold me while we live this fantasy

Just what you really do to me  
That is O.K.

So many years ago, life in itself can't hurt

What's keeping her from searching  
You cannot pierce that and  
You're dressed too tight  
  
Got a lot to learn about wrong and right  
So dye you hair, dad's gonna wash it out  
Come on wash out your mouth

"(Was actually sung by Unique ii)  
  
Last night I had the strangest dream,  
I sailed away to China, in a little row boat to find ya,  
And you said you had to get your laundry cleaned  
Didn't want no one to hold you what does that mean? And you said...  
  
[Chorus:]  
Ain't nothin' gonna break my break my stride,  
Nobody gonna slow me down, oh no,  
I've got to keep on movin'.  
Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride,  
I'm runnin' and I won't touch ground, oh no,  
I've got to keep on movin'.  
  
You're on the road and now you pray it's gone  
The road behind was rocky, but now you're feelin' cocky.  
You look at me and you see your past.  
Is that the reason why you're runnin' so fast and you said...  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Never let another girl like you work me over  
Never let another girl like you drag me under  
If I meet another girl like you I will tell her  
Never want another girl like you have to say oh

Feeling kind of dizzy, a gong struck and people chanted

Glass is shattered from the fight  
In this tug of war you'll always win  
Even when I'm right  
  
'Cause you feed me fables from your hands  
With violent words and empty threats

Fell in love on Christmas night  
But I knew you say I woke up and you wasn't by my side  
Now I need someone to hold  
Be my fire in the cold

You're a little bit too late  
You're the only one to blame  
Wipe that look off your face  
You can wish a thousand times  
But none of that will change my mind, boy  
You had a chance you'll never get back, get back, nothing

Julie was a long way from home  
She can make alone look pretty  
Her attitude made a part of her landscape  
Riding her bike through alphabet city  
  
She likes to party in the backseat, under the bridge on the Brooklyn side  
Smoking cigarettes in the afterglow, taking bets till the sun won't rise  
She said ""what good is tomorrow without a guarantee?""  
She can lick her lips and smile and make you want to believe  
  
That the consequences of your actions really are just a game  
That your life is just a chain reaction, taking you day by day  
She says nothing's forever in this crazy world  
Still I'm falling in love with the right now poster girl  
(Right now right now ooh ooh ooh)  
  
Julie likes to shop lift in stores  
Right alongside the rich and famous  
Get in elevators, press emergency stop  
And make love on the floor until the camera made us  
  
And no woman in the world ever made me feel like my heart's on fire  
When she walked, I followed, when she laughed, I cried,  
""What good is tomorrow without a guarantee?""  
And I was wrapped around her finger, and I began to believe  
  
That the consequences of your actions really are just a game  
That your life is just a chain reaction, taking you day by day  
She says nothing's forever in this crazy world  
Still I'm falling in love with the right now poster girl

Kids are murdering other kids for the fun of it,  
Instead of using their mind or their fist, they put a gun in it

Deceptions and indecision, no faith or religion, how we're living.  
The clock is ticking, the end is coming, there'll be no warning,  
But will we live to see the dawn.  
  
How can we preach, when all we make this world to be  
Is a living hell torturing our minds.  
We all must unite, to turn darkness to light,  
And the love in our hearts will shine.  
  
We're disconnected from love, we're disrespecting each other  
Whatever happened to protecting each other  
Poisoned your body and your soul for a minute of pleasure,

Babies being born in the world already drug addicted and afflicted,  
Family values are contradicted.  
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust, the pressure is building and I've had enough.

Fine  
So everyday I find a little something  
To remind me  
No matter how I try  
I can't put the past behind me  
  
The trouble is I can't get her out of my mind  
When I close my eyes at night  
Who's gonna save me

The trouble is there's a part of me  
That still can't let go of her memory  
And now I know what it is  
  
Love has let me go  
I'm alright, I'm okay  
I'll be fine, give it time  
  
But the only trouble is I can't get her out of my mind  
When I close my eyes at night  
Who's gonna save me  
Now she's gone (she's gone)  
The trouble is there's a part of me

On the Backstreet's Back, alright

Another victim of your sexuality

Don't want you back  
Forgive my honesty but you gotta go  
I don't want you back  
  
You started going out with so-called friends  
But I was blind and so I lost all common sense  
But there were things that made me realize  
Like all the hundred no, thousand lies

Baby, don't bother telling me your reasons why  
  
Just let us sing this story 'bout you and I

And let it all just wash away in a downpour  
I wanna feel the rain, feel the rain

The shades pulled down  
I still can't face the sun

So let me close my eyes  
  
And sleep perchance to dream  
So I can see the face I long to touch  
To kiss  
But only dreams can bring me this  
  
So let the moon shine softly on  
The boy I long to see  
And maybe when he dreams  
He'll dream of me  
  
I hide beneath the clouds  
And whisper to the evening star  
They tell me love is just a dream away, dream away, dream away, dream away  
I'll dream away

The boy I long to see  
And maybe when he dreams  
He'll dream of me

Is the price of what love costs

That's when it's gone  
And you're thinking you're invincible  
Believe me, you're so wrong  
Tell me how does it feel  
  
How does it feel to be a fallen angel?

"I wake up every morning and see your face

Last thing you said is how dare you  
First thing I said is I'm sorry  
Now I'm sitting here  
Helpless

Same old story  
  
Now she's brokenhearted  
Time heals all the wounds  
She said  
Not this time  
It's true  
Everyone plays a fool

Took advantage of a woman who loved me

"LOVING YOU  
  
I love how loving you makes me feel  
And I love how loving you feels so real  
Through the good through the bad  
When I'm happy or sad  
I'd rather be loving you than anything else in the world  
Ohoooh Loving you than anything else  
  
All my life I've dreamed of a princess all dressed in white  
Standing there to be my bride and then there's you  
A sending from Heaven right before my eyes  
Letting me know that there is a God somewhere I know  
Many people think they find love in the world  
But this kind of love isn't found it finds you it takes you  
  
I love how loving you makes me feel oh yeah  
And I love how loving you feels so real so real baby  
Through the good through the bad  
When I'm happy or sad  
I'd rather be loving you than anything else in the world  
Ohoooh I'd rather be loving you than anything else in the world (in the world)  
  
All my life I've wondered if I'd hear all the bells and whistles  
If the one should come my way  
Then there is you like the wind makes the earth shake  
Making me a believer there must be a God somewhere I know  
Many people think they find love in the world  
But this kind of love isn't found it finds you it takes you  
  
This kind of love doesn't come from just a touch  
Nor does it come from anything you can't pay for  
Its so pure if we just send love on in the world  
  
Cus I love how loving you makes me feel oh yeah  
And I love how loving you feels so real so real so real  
Through the good through the bad the bad  
When I'm happy or sad  
I'd rather be loving you than anything else in the world

Holding the phone tight, I hear the tone twice  
If you just pick up, swear I can fix us

That way you won't erase the message

No man ever let you be free  
And oh you're fed up with the jealousy  
  
I'll give you all the freedom that you need  
Baby you and I will succeed  
I like to know what I need to do  
How to behave, oh how to please you  
I can't take it, oh come home  
Let me kiss those lips  
You can tell me what you wanna do  
If you want me to bring the freak outta you  
  
Don't want violated things and make you mad  
Don't want violated things that make you sad  
Let me just find it right here pretty lady  
We can make it baby

What if we loose all the money baby  
What if there's nothing but you and me  
Tell me what would you do pretty lady  
Would you at least take care of me  
  
You can tell me how you deal the stress  
When everything becomes a big mess  
We stay strong and fight it off  
Or would you pack your shhh, and take off..

While it's resting on pillows of sky

Together we lay in a calm that comes after a storm  
In a moment or two, we can hear the stars coming through  
I love the quiet right after the rain here with you  
  
After the rain, the birds want to fly  
The trees all in green hang the leaves out to dry  
Like puddles and pools, what your eyes let me see  
Are their loving reflections of me  
After a while, you touch me and then  
I feel like a flower that longs for a shower again  
  
And then lost in a kiss,  
I could stay for hours like this  
Though i don't know just what magic the raindrops contain  
I know that everything's wonderful after the rain

How do you say it will all be alright  
When you know that it mightn't be true?  
What do you do?  
  
Careful the things you say,  
Children will listen.  
Careful the things you do,  
Children will see.  
And learn.  
Children may not obey,  
But children will listen.  
Children will look to you  
For which way to turn,  
To learn what to be.  
Careful before you say,  
""listen to me.""  
Children will listen.  
  
Careful the wish you make,  
Wishes are children.  
Careful the path they take,  
Wishes come true,  
Not free.  
Careful the spell you cast,  
Not just on children.  
Sometimes the spell may last  
Past what you can see  
And turn against you...  
  
Careful the tale you tell.  
That is the spell.  
Children will listen...  
  
How can you say to a child who's in flight,  
Don't slip away and i won't hold so tight?  
What can you say that no matter how slight won't be misunderstood?  
What do you leave to your child when you're dead  
Only what ever you put in its head  
Things that your mother and father had said  
Which were left to them too.  
Careful what you say, children will listen  
Careful you do it too, children will see and learn.  
Oh!  
  
Guide them but step away,  
Children will glisten.  
Temper with what is true  
And children will turn,  
If just to be free.  
Careful before you say,  
""listen to me.""  
Children will listen...  
Children will listen!  
Children, children will listen

"This is a Christmas Lullaby

I know you're here

In front of Waverley, but unfortunately,

A drummer, he resembles George Harrison of the Beatles,  
But he wears his hair tied in a small bow at the back.  
I love him but it embarrasses me,  
To walk down the street with him.  
He lives in Brooklyn somewhere,  
And wears a white crash helmet.  
He has gold chains on his leather jacket,  
And on the back are written the names,  
""Mary"" and ""Mom"" and ""Hell's Angels"".  
I would gratefully appreciate it,  
If you see him, tell him,  
I'm in the park with my girlfriend.  
And please,  
Tell him Angela and I don't want the 2 dollars back,

One golden sky

No tears to cry  
With you I have it all  
  
If love can never die  
I'm not afraid to fly  
But how far must I fall  
  
One silver song  
One lullaby  
For all the love we make  
  
It's the look in your eyes  
It's the moon on the rise  
It's the sound of the heart  
That you break  
  
Gone is the dark of night  
Call on the early glow  
Send down the birds of love  
That circle us below  
  
And still I will hunger for  
You whispering, ""Mi amor""  
Over the ocean's roar  
And your arms reach for me

"I saw you looking in the mirror  
I saw you fighting with your conscious  
I think you need a little time away  
And I may give you mine  
  
And you could find me in the moon glow  
You find me underneath your pillow  
And we can find a little hideaway  
Where we can go

I stood with my defenses down  
So many things that bring you close to me  
That we be led astray, the wonder of desire  
To love the things we cannot touch  
  
Maybe we turn and say goodnight and walk away  
And then the story can go on without a single tear  
You take a chance on it and change the history  
And for a time, we fall in love with someone  
  
So who am I to say the words that say  
We have found each other?  
Can we imagine any hideaway is right?  
And our adventure down in paradise  
Borne upon the wind and we are one with the night  
  
Maybe we shuffle off to Rio  
A little Rio de Janeiro  
And then I get a little chance to say  
I'm falling into you

This lonely heart of mine has found a mission for your light

Once again the times are changin'  
Once again I lost my way  
Well the words of ancient poets  
Fall like dust upon my shoes  
Greed has robbed me of my vision

So take my hand and lift me higher  
Be my love and my desire  
Hold me safe and honor bound  
Take my heart to higher ground  
I have walked too long in darkness  
I have walked too long alone  
Blindly clutching fists of diamonds  
That I found were only stones  
I would trade the world of ages  
For a warmer hand to hold  
The path of light is narrow  
But it leads to streets of gold  
So take my hand and lift me higher  
Be my love and my desire  
Hold me safe and honor bound  
Take my heart to higher ground  
In this world we move through shadows  
Never sure of what we see  
While the truth that lies between us  
Come and share the truth with me

The cardboard trees, the painted seas, the sound here

The whispered conversations in overcrowded hallways  
The atmosphere as thrilling here as always

Feel the magic in the making  
Why, everything's as if we never said goodbye  
  
I've spent so many mornings just trying to resist you  
I'm trembling now, you can't know how I've missed you  
Missed the fairy tale adventure  
In this ever spinning playground  
We were young together  
  
I'm coming out of make-up  
The lights already burning  
Not long until the cameras will start turning  
And the early morning madness  
And the magic in the making  
Yes, everything's as if we never said goodbye  
  
I don't want to be alone  
That's all in the past  
This world's waited long enough  
I've come home at last!  
  
And this time will be bigger  
And brighter than we knew it  
So watch me fly, we all know I can do it  
Could I stop my hand from shaking?  
Has there ever been a moment  
With so much to live for?  
  
The whispered conversations in overcrowded hallways  
So much to say not just today but always  
We'll have early morning madness  
We'll have magic in the making  
Yes, everything's as if we never said goodbye  
Yes, everything's as if we never said goodbye  
We taught the world new ways to dream!

"You must remember this,  
A kiss is just a kiss,  
A sigh is just a sigh,  
The fundamental things apply,  
  
As time goes by.  
And when two lovers woo,  
They still say ""i love you,""  
On that you can rely,  
  
No matter what the future brings,  
As time goes by.  
  
Moonlight and love songs,  
Never out of date,  
Hearts full of passion,  
Jealousy and hate,  
Woman needs man, and man must have his mate,  
There's no one can deny.  
  
It's still the same old story,  
A fight for love and glory,  
A case of do or die,  
The world will always welcome lovers,  
As time goes by.

"When you're just out walking and you pass  
Little signs that say ""keep off the grass""  
Did you ever stop and ask yourself why?  
Pretty playgrounds children used to know  
Little squares where lovers love to go  
Disappear so parking lots can grow  
Why?  
  
Once you start the questions never cease  
What's disturbed when you disturb the peace  
Pets and children are prohibited  
  
Why? ask yourself why?  
And when you think about it  
Bullets fly like popcorn on the screen  
Recommended wholesome nice and clean  
Making love's the thing that can't be seen  
Why?  
  
Let your hair down just an inch or two  
Let your skin be red or green or blue  
They invent a special name for you  
Why?  
  
On a clear day oh say can you see  
What remains of mountain's scenery  
Catch a glimpse of all the scenery, sky,  
Beautiful sky ..as shiny as a penny  
So when you're out walking and you pass  
Near a sign that say ""keep off the grass""  
Put a sign right next to it that says ""why?""

Loving our neighbors so peacefully  
There's really no harm if we do not disarm  
For we always in close harmony  
Four little angels of peace are we  
There is one thing on which we agree  
With fall or with friend  
We will fight to the end  
Just for peace, peace, peace...  
Though we butchered the boss  
And I've own made the choice  
And slaughter the irish no end  
Though I'm injured and poor  
Slaying hoard upon hoard  
We're but playing the part of a friend  
Yes, our arms we ain't twist  
But we'll be elected for peace  
Except in the case of the crook  
We conquered both spears  
Now we're up to our ears  
Just trying to keep what we took  
Three little angels of peace are we  
Living together so blissfully  
Oh, we never fight unless  
We're on the right  
But we're always in the right, you see?  
Three little angels of peace are we  
There is one thing on which we agree  
Until we are wrecks  
We'll break each other's necks  
Just for peace, peace, peace...  
In japan we've the right  
In a generous night  
But the emperor knows peace is finer  
It isn't our fault it's a case of absurd  
We're picked down and buried by china  
Oh, how we're deplored  
I glad did it for the world  
We're a nation of poets and thinkers  
Also, though we bound without pity  
And lay west to his city  
It's because all the chinese are stinkers  
Two little angels of peace are we  
Living together in amity  
We'll sign any pack saying we won't attack  
But it's just a mere formality  
Two little angels of peace are we  
There is one thing on which we agree  
We try to keep calm  
When we gas, we bump  
Just for peace, peace, peace...  
Now I know that our war  
Is a thing to have horror  
And that peaceful fill out  
When we hope we have  
With our love from the start  
I atrocious did all my part  
To civilize nearly the hope we have  
Though you call me sadistic  
Imperialistic  
My armies required a quarry  
And though we may slave  
What's a splendid day today  
After all that we'll say that we're sorry  
Though I fall for the urge  
Of a nice bloody purge  
And living my way I was carrying on  
Though I clean up my schmutz  
Would I hear nazi putz  
It is all for the sake of the aryan  
My ambitions are small  
I want nothing at all  
My plans wouldn't be any littler  
Now that austria's nazi  
It will be hazy-gazy  
To put the whole world under hitler  
Four little angels of peace are we  
Drinking with older of saintity  
Though we slaughter the meek  
We confirm every week  
And we talk it over peacefully  
Four little angels of peace are we  
There is one thing on which we agree  
We'll shout and we'll shell  
We'll get each other's hell  
Just for peace, peace, peace...

As the prince moved his head back and forth with the music going on

He ran back amazed and he hopped right back into bed  
  
That night he dreamt all night  
Mostly about his radio and his friend the Pied Piper  
  
The prince did try what the Piper said to do  
But for weeks at night  
He heard nothing like the music of that magic night  
  
""That Pied Piper must have been joking"" he said  
""There's nothing but Bach on this radio  
I'm gonna throw it back up in the attic for good""  
This he sat disbelieving the young prince so loud  
That two of his brothers overheard him  
The next day those two brothers took the radio from the attic and turned  
It on

"I was working in the lab, late one night  
When my eyes beheld an eerie sight  
For my monster from his slab, began to rise  
And suddenly to my surprise  
He did the mash, he did the monster mash  
The monster mash, it was a graveyard smash  
He did the mash, it caught on in a flash  
He did the mash, he did the monster mash  
From my laboratory in the castle east  
To the master bedroom where the vampires feast  
The ghouls all came from their humble abodes  
To get a jolt from my electrodes  
They did the mash , they did the monster mash  
The monster mash, it was a graveyard smash  
They did the mash , it caught on in a flash  
They did the mash , they did the monster mash  
If you've ever seen a monster before  
Dancin' across the dance floor  
Don't be afraid, don't run and shout  
Turn around and help the monster turn it out  
Get down with the monster mash  
Get down with the monster mash  
Get down with the monster mash  
Get down with the monster mash  
And if you don't have core hard cash  
You can still do the monster mash  
The scene was rockin', all were digging the sounds  
Igor on chains, backed by his baying hounds  
The coffin-bangers were about to arrive  
With their vocal group, 'The Crypt-Kicker Five'  
They played the mash, they played the monster mash  
The monster mash, it was a graveyard smash  
They played the mash, it caught on in a flash  
They played the mash, they played the monster mash  
Out from the coffin', Drac's voice did ring  
Seems he was troubled by just one thing  
He opened the lid and shook his fist and said  
""Whatever happened to my Transylvania Twist?  
It's now the mash, it's now the monster mash  
The monster mash, it was graveyard smash  
It's now the mash, it caught on in a flash  
It's now the mash, it's now the monster mash  
Now everything's cool, Drac's a part of the band  
And my Monster Mash is the hit of the land  
For you, the living this mash was meant too  
When you get to my door, tell them Borris sent you  
Then you can mash, then you can monster mash  
The monster mash and do my graveyard smash  
Then you can mash, you'll catch on in a flash  
Then you can mash, then you can monster mash  
The monster mash  
Get down with the monster mash  
Get down with the monster mash  
Get down with the monster mash

And be better off than you are  
Or would you rather be a pig  
  
A pig is an animal with dirt on his face  
His shoes are a terrible disgrace  
He has no manners when he eats his food  
He's fat and lazy and extremely rude  
But if you don't care a feather or a fig  
You may grow up to be a pig  
  
Or would you like to swing on a star  
Carry moonbeams home in a jar  
And be better off than you are  
Or would you rather be a fish  
  
A fish won't do anything, but swim in a brook  
He can't write his name or read a book  
To fool the people is his only thought  
And though he's slippery, he still gets caught  
But then if that sort of life is what you wish  
You may grow up to be a fish  
A new kind of jumped-up slippery fish  
  
And all the monkeys aren't in the zoo  
Every day you meet quite a few  
So you see it's all up to you  
You can be better than you are  
You could be swingin' on a star

And I mean to care for no one  
Because I'm through with love.  
Why did you lead me  
To think you could care?  
You didn't need me  
For you had your share  
Of slaves around you  
To hound you and swear  
With deep emotion and devotion to you.  
Goodbye to spring and all it meant to me  
It can never bring the thing that used to be.  
For I must have you or no one  
And so I'm through with love.

This is the story of El Lute  
A man who was born to be hunted like a wild animal  
Because he was poor  
But he refused to accept his fate  
And today his honor has been restored  
  
He was only nineteen  
When was sentenced to die  
For something that somebody else did  
And blamed on El Lute  
Then they changed it to life  
And so he could escape  
From then only chased him  
And searched for him day and night  
All over Spain  
But the search was in vain  
For El Lute  
  
He had only seen the dark side of life  
The man they called El Lute  
And he wanted a home  
Just like you and like me  
In a country where all would be free  
Though he taught himself  
To read and to write  
It didn't help El Lute  
He was one who had dared to escape overnight  
They had to find  
El Lute  
  
Soon the fame of his tale  
Spread like wild fire  
All over the land  
Were the prize on his head  
People still gave him bread  
And they gave him a hand  
For they knew he was right  
And his fight was their fight  
  
No one gave you a chance  
In the Spain of those days  
On was every place  
They had put up the face of El Lute  
And he robbed where he could  
Just like once Robin Hood  
They finally caught him  
And that seemed the end  
But they caught him in vain  
Cause a change came for Spain  
And El Lute  
  
He had only seen the dark side of life  
And then freedom really came to his land  
And also to El Lute  
Now he walks in the line  
Of a sunny new day  
The man they call El Lute

If the going gets rough  
But when I started thinking  
They didn't even bluff  
  
'Bout a year has come and gone  
And left me standing here  
Thinking how it could have been  
For still I ain't nowhere  
They surely took me for a ride  
Trampled on my pride

Some people said he was a ghost

And if he ever came their way  
They'd be sticks and stones, I'd say  
That would grieve him

He didn't mind it  
She seemed as happy as a song  
And if anything was wrong  
He didn't find it  
  
They used to laugh and dance and drink  
And not ever did he think of a payday  
No matter where they ever were  
Every day he spent with her was a hey-day  
  
He was a steppenwolf, and not a handsome man  
He was a steppenwolf, who didn't know her plan  
He was a steppenwolf, not very bright at all  
He was a steppenwolf, just riding for a fall  
He was a steppenwolf

And I ain't teasing

Nothing that I ever found  
Would fulfill me

When I say that we're through  
You must kill me!""

He was a steppenwolf, ""you know how much I care""  
He was a steppenwolf, she said ""this is the deal""

Hark, now hear the angels sing, a king was born today,  
And man will live for evermore, because of Christmas Day.  
For a moment the world was aglow, all the bells rang out  
There were tears of joy and laughter, people shouted  
""Let everyone know, there is hope for all to find peace.""  
Now Joseph and his wife, Mary, came to Bethlehem that night,  
They found no place to bear her child, not a single room was in sight.  
And then they found a little nook, in a stable all forlorn,  
And in a manger cold 'n' dark, Mary's little boy was born.  
Hark, now hear the angels sing, a king was born today,  
And man will live for evermore, because of Christmas Day.

Lend ear to nature's cry.

Fight for her trees,  
Pollution robs air to breathe.  
  
Don't kill the world  
Help her survive  
And she'll reward you with life  
And don't just talk,  
Go on and do the one, who wins is you.

A present from god  
On behalf of all creatures,  
Made by the lord  
Care for the earth,  
Foundation of life  
Slow progress down help her survive

"A ray of hope flickers in the sky  
A tiny star lights up way up high  
All across the land dawns a brand new morn  
This comes to pass when a child is born  
  
A silent wish sails the seven seas  
The winds of change whisper in the trees  
And the walls of doubt crumble tossed and torn  
This comes to pass when a child is born  
  
A rosy hue settles all around  
You've got the feel you're on solid ground  
For a spell or two no-one seems forlorn  
This comes to pass when a child is born  
  
And all of this happened  
Because the world is waiting  
Waiting for one child  
Black, white, yellow, no one knows  
But a child that would grow up and turn tears to laughter  
Hate to love, war to peace  
And everyone to everyone's neighbour  
Misery and suffering would be forgotten forever  
  
It's all a dream and illusion now  
It must come true, sometimes soon somehow  
All across the land dawns a brand new morn  
This comes to pass when a child is born

I don't want to hear that I'm too young  
  
To know it's love that makes me feel this way

Is longing to show me the way  
I don't want to wait  
  
[Chorus]  
Just one kiss from you, and suddenly  
I see the road laid out in front of me  
You give me strength, you give me hope  
And when you hold me in your arms  
You make me whole  
And I don't know just what I would do  
Without one kiss from you  
  
I don't want to hear my time will come  
When it feels like it's already here  
We should learn to walk before we run  
But why go anywhere when you're so near  
  
'Cause when I reach out to you  
So sad and confused  
And feeling like I could cry  
You dry my eyes

"This is the story about Mona Lisa  
The Mona Lisa  
Ladies and gentlemen, I've got a little story to tell  
About Mona Lisa and how she suddenly fell  
See everyone knew her, they knew her oh so well  
Now I am taking over to release her from her spell  
She's the original  
She's unforgettable  
She wants you to know  
She's been gone  
It's kind of incredible  
She's so unpredictable  
She wants you to know  
She's been gone, she's been gone, she's been gone  
She was taken under drowning in her sea  
Running like an angel, she was crying and could not see, oh no  
Now see everyone's watching as she starts to fall  
They want her to breakdown be a legend of her fall  
She's the original  
She's unforgettable  
She wants you to know  
She's been gone  
It's kind of incredible  
She's so unpredictable  
She wants you to know  
She's been gone, she's been gone, she's been gone  
Ladies does that make you cry?  
Mona Lisa's got to fly, nobody really dies  
Everyone, may we have a moment of silence right here

Just walked in and it's early mornin'  
Bump, bump till the break of dawn  
And it don't stop till the early mornin'  
Passed out on the couch and yawnin'  
Just walked in and it's early mornin'  
Bump, bump till the break of dawn

Met a tall dude, kinda dark hair  
When he walked up somebody grabbed him  
But I liked him told him come here  
Kinda cool  
Baby, we can make plans  
Where ya live  
Do ya mama live there  
We can hook up at the hotel

You put your hands out in the air

Now my baby's dancing  
But she's dancing with another man  
  
My pride, my ego, my needs, and my selfish ways  
Caused a good strong woman like you to walk out my life  
Now I never, never get to clean up the mess I made, oh  
And it haunts me every time I close my eyes  
  
It all just sounds like ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh  
Mm, too young, too dumb to realize  
That I should have bought you flowers  
And held your hand  
Should have given you all my hours  
When I had the chance  
Take you to every party 'cause all you wanted to do was dance  
  
Now my baby's dancing  
But she's dancing with another man  
  
Although it hurts  
I'll be the first to say that I was wrong  
Oh, I know I'm probably much too late  
To try and apologize for my mistakes  
But I just want you to know  
  
I hope he buys you flowers  
I hope he holds your hand  
Give you all his hours  
When he has the chance  
Take you to every party  
'Cause I remember how much you loved to dance  
Do all the things I should have done  
When I was your man  
Do all the things I should have done  
When I was your man

Better now than in a year,

We in recession but let me take a crack at it  
I'll probably take whatever's left and just split it up  
So everybody that I love can have a couple bucks

Eating good sleeping soundly  
I know we all have a similar dream  
Go in your pocket pull out your wallet

"Now Hollywood wants to make you think they know what love is. But I'm a tell
you what true love is. Love is not what you see in the movies. It's not the
ecstasy it's not what you see in that scene you know what I mean? I'm telling
you right now true love is sacrifice. Love is thinking about others before you
think about yourself love is selfless not selfish. Love is God and God is
love. Love is when you lay down your life for another whether for your brother
your mother your father or your sister it's even laying down your life for
your enemies that's unthinkable but think about that. Love is true. Think.  
  
I'll put you in front of me  
So everybody can see  
My love this is my love  
  
I know that I'll be alright  
As long as you are my guide  
My love this is my love  
  
Love is patient love is kind. It does not envy it does not boast it is not
proud. It is not rude it is not self-seeking it is not easily angered it keeps
no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the
truth. It always protects always trusts always hopes it always perseveres.  
Love never fails. Love is everlasting it's eternal it goes on and on it goes
beyond time love is the only thing that will last when you die but ask the
question why? Do you have love?  
  
I'll put you in front of me  
So everybody can see  
My love this is my love  
  
I know that I'll be alright  
As long as you are my guide  
My love this is my love  
  
There is no greater love than this than he who lays down his life for his
friends. Now are you willing to lay down your life for your friends? You're
probably willing to lay down your life for your mother your father or your
best friends but are you willing to lay down your life for even those that
hate you? I'm going to tell you who did that the definition of love is Jesus
Christ. He is love. The nails in his hands the thorns in his brow hanging on a
cross for your sin my sins that is love he died for you and me while we still
hated him that is love. God is true love and if you don't know this love now
is the time to know perfect love.  
  
I'll put you in front of me

If I say I'm going to leave, that's the only time you want me  
Next time you need me there I won't make it  
Another late night call I won't take it  
Because now I finally see, you only want me when you're lonely  
  
Nothing's ever changing, decisions you can't make it  
You just think of yourself and never me at all  
If you're with your friends, you just string me along  
But I won't allow it anymore, so it's time for me to move on

Because I can finally see, you only want me when you're lonely  
If I say I'm going to leave, that's the only time you want me  
Next time you need me there I won't make it  
Another late night call I won't take it  
Cos now I finally see, you only want me when you're lonely  
Only when you're lonely, lonely  
Only when you're lonely  
Only when you're lonely, lonely  
Only when you're lonely

I can finally see, you only want me when you're lonely  
If I say I'm going to leave, that's the only time you want me  
Next time you need me there I won't make it  
Another late night call I won't take it

You're like a button on my sleeve  
And this lullaby , oh  
  
I can melt the drops of freezing rain  
I'll fly in and save the day  
I will always try to make it  
Better than it was for me  
  
You'll always be the first one in my prayers  
Just close your eyes and I am there  
It's a better world  
Since you're my boy I'll always be your girl  
Your girl

"Sorry I know I'm late  
Guess I lost all track of time  
Started walking and couldn't stop turning it over in my mind  
Trying to make some sense of it  
Trying to make the pieces fit  
I thought I covered my tracks so well  
But now he says he knew about it from the start  
Yeah he knew about us all along...  
  
If there was any other way  
Don't you think I've tried to find it  
Don't you think I want to stay  
If there was any other way love  
There's no way out of this  
There just ain't any other way...  
  
Maybe I'd better be leaving now  
But there's something I want you to understand before I go  
Sometimes we don't have a choice when we play and break the rules  
I just had to see you darlin', one more time  
If only just to say good bye  
cause he knew about us all the time  
  
I never wanted to be like this  
I never meant to get serious  
But now the thought of losing you  
Takes some getting used to

"I learned the truth at seventeen  
That love was meant for beauty queens  
And high school girls with clear-skinned smiles  
Who married young and then retired  
  
The valentines I never knew  
The Friday night charades of youth  
Were spent on one more beautiful  
At seventeen I learned the truth  
  
And those of us with ravaged faces  
Lacking in the social graces  
Desperately remained at home  
Inventing lovers on the phone  
Who called to say ""Come dance with me""  
And murmured vague obscenities  
It isn't all it seems at seventeen  
  
A brown eyed girl in hand-me-downs  
Whose name I never could pronounce  
Said, ""Pity, please, the ones who serve  
They only get what they deserve.  
The rich relationed hometown queen  
Marries into what she needs  
With a guarantee of company  
And haven for the elderly""  
  
So remember those who win the game  
Lose the love they sought to gain  
In debentures of quality  
And dubious integrity  
The small town eyes will gape at you  
In dull surprise when payment due  
Exceeds accounts received at seventeen  
  
To those of us who knew the pain  
Of valentines that never came  
And those whose names were never called  
When choosing sides for basketball  
It was long ago and far away  
The world was younger than today  
When dreams were all they gave for free  
To ugly ducking girls like me  
  
We all play the game and when we dare  
We cheat ourselves at solitaire  
Inventing lovers on the phone  
Repenting other lives unknown  
That call and say, ""Come dance with me""  
And murmur vague obscenities  
At ugly girls like me at seventeen

"Ave Maria, Maiden mild  
Oh, listen to a maiden's prayer  
For thou canst hear amid the wild  
'Tis thou, 'tis thou canst save amid, despair

Though we've by man outcast reviled  
Oh Maiden, see a maiden's sorrow  
Oh Mother, hear a suppliant child

Nothin' else is gonna do

Never know how much I care

Be it Fahrenheit or Centigrade  
  
They give you fever when you kiss them  
Fever if you live and learn  
Fever 'til you sizzle

There, running my hands through his hair  
Both of us thinking how good it can be  
Someone is speaking but he doesn't know she's there

I want him everywhere and if he's beside me  
I know I need never care  
But to love him is to need him everywhere  
Knowing that love is to share  
  
Each one believing that love never dies  
Watching his eyes and hoping I'm always there  
I'll be there

Each one believing that love never dies  
Watching his eyes and hoping I'm always there  
  
I will be there... and everywhere

We don't say goodbye  
I'll make them all remember me  
  
'Cause I have found a dream that must come true  
Every ounce of me must see it through

I'm sorry I don't have a role for love to play  
Hand over my heart I'll find my way  
I will make them give to me

That I'm your perfect crush

You can swear you mean it

It's supposed to be

We don't want to loose it

Don't even touch the ground  
  
Cause when I'm feeling down  
He's there to pick me up

He doesn't interrupt  
Let me tell you there's no better guy  
This is how it makes me feel inside

I wanna play (play)  
Well can you hear my heartbeat (boom boom)

And every day and night he tells me  
I'm so special he could never give me up

I'm hooked on a feeling  
A natural high  
You better believe it  
And the reason why  
It's a thing called love  
It makes me feel so alive  
And I can't fight the feeling  
  
Somebody told me once  
You only get one chance  
So live your life  
And do the best you can  
Once a day goes by  
You never get it back  
So live every minute  
Like it was your last  
  
Just dance (dance) mmm  
Come on play (play)  
And tell somebody you love them (I love you)  
At least once a day  
And don't stop (stop)  
Till you drop (drop)  
I didn't know that wanting someone so special  
Would come along to steal my heart  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Love, love, love  
And don't let it slip  
That was all you need  
If you taste it once  
It won't be enough

Can't fight the feeling  
I said, no, can't, can't, can't  
Can't fight the feeling  
Can't fight, oh!  
You better believe it  
You better believe it  
Can't fight the feeling

"Back when I was a child  
Before life removed all the innocence  
My father would lift me high  
And dance with my mother and me  
And then spin me around 'til I fell asleep  
Then up the stairs he would carry me  
And I knew for sure I was loved  
If I could get another chance  
Another walk, another dance with him  
I'd play a song that would never ever end  
How I'd love, love, love  
To dance with my father again  
  
When I and my mother will disagree  
To get my way I would run from her to him  
He'd make me laugh just to comfort me, yeah, yeah  
Then finally make me do just what my mama says  
Later that night when I was asleep  
He left a dollar under my sheet  
Never dreamed that he would be gone from me  
If I could steal one final glance  
One final step, one final dance with him  
I'd play a song that will never, never end  
'Cause I'd love, I'd love to dance with my father again  
  
Sometimes I'd listen outside her door  
And I'd hear how my mama cried for him  
I pray for her even more than me  
I pray for her even more than me  
  
I know I'm praying for much too much  
But could you send back the only man she loved  
I know you don't do it usually  
But dear Lord, she's dying  
To dance with my father again  
Every night I fall asleep  
And this is all I ever dream

If there's nothing between us you don't know  
what you'll miss  
  
No love  
There's no love  
Baby it's true  
There's no love  
  
But if love is out the question  
There's no point to this affection  
'Cause if love is out the question  
Put a little heart in your intention

"(Walter Afanasieff, John Bettis)  
  
Here they come  
Every night the same  
Silent stars  
Light from a distant flame  
Just like the memories of you  
That I hold inside  
I see you touch  
But all the warmth has died  
  
Empty rooms  
Crowded by the past  
Time is my enemy  
Days keep moving faster  
But the nights alone can be  
An eternity  
That never heals the scars  
Of foolish pride  
  
If only you could see me now  
Goodbye is not so easy now  
The freedom that I walked away to gain  
Is nothing but these chains  
That you alone can break  
And you would free me now  
Your heart would come undone  
Just looking at me once  
And my love would bring you back  
If only you could see me now  
  
Here I am  
Stranger to a smile  
Trying to fight the tears  
Missing by a mile  
I'm not the one who laughed at you  
On that yesterday  
When you warned me not to throw your love away  
  
If you could only see me now  
Goodbye is not so easy now  
The freedom that I walked away to gain  
Is nothing but these chains  
I know your heart would break  
If you could hear me now  
Your heart would come undone  
If you could hear me once  
Hoping love will bring you back  
If only you could see me now  
  
[Bridge:]  
  
Like the lonely moon  
You see above  
That sails the dark alone  
Forever  
I have no light of my own  
Other the love we've known  
So long ago  
Together  
  
If you could feel me now  
Your heart would come undone  
If you could touch me once  
I know love will bring you back  
If only you could see me now

"I never found out why you walked away  
And never said good-bye  
But now that I see you  
I'm torn inside, but I've still got my pride

I'm afraid of the truth  
But what can I do if I still want you  
  
If we could start over again  
I know if we try our love could be stronger  
If we could start over again  
I'm sure, we oh

Something has to make us feel this way  
Love by another name  
Doesn't matter 'cause it's still the same love  
Won't depend upon the words we say  
Love by another name  
Something happens when we're making love  
  
Si ce n'est pas l'amour  
Qu'est-ce que c'est?  
  
We're superstitious  
When every day is like Christmas  
No promise spoken  
Hearts don't have to get broken  
More than a four letter word  
  
If we're just pretending  
We can write a new ending  
If we don't like where it leads  
  
Well it's new romantic  
Action over words  
The sweetest nothings that I've heard  
  
I can't tell you everything I'm feeling  
More than this  
Do you know  
What it is, 'cause  
  
I know that I can't describe  
What I'm feeling inside  
Maybe I'll learn  
I guess I live with the fear  
This could all disappear  
If I try to put it in words

"There ain't a dream that don't have a chance  
To come true now  
It just takes a little faith baby  
Anything that we want to do  
We can do now  
There ain't nothing in our way baby  
Nothing our love couldn't rise above  
We can get through the night  
We can get to the light  
Long as we got our love to light the way

Just a little trust

Love can move mountains  
Believe in your heart  
And feel, feel it in your soul  
And love baby love can love can move mountains  
  
Oceans deep and mountains high  
They can't stop us  
Because love is on our side baby  
We can reach the heavens and touch the sky  
Just believe it, believe in you and I baby  
If we got love that is strong enough  
We can do anything, make it through anything  
'Cause through it all love will always find a way  
  
With a little faith...  
  
You believe in me

"[Chorus]  
Love doesn't ask why  
It speaks from the heart  
And never explains  
Don't you know that  
Love doesn't think twice  
It can come all at once  
Or whisper from a distance  
  
Don't ask me if this feeling's right or wrong  
It doesn't have to make much sense  
It just has to be this strong  
'Cause when you're in my arms I understand  
We don't try to have a voice  
When our hearts make the choices  
There's no plan  
It's in our hands  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now I can feel what you're afraid to say  
If you give your soul to me  
Will you give too much away  
We can't let this moment pass us by  
Can't question this chance  
Or expect any answers  
We can try  
But love doesn't ask you why  
  
So let's take what we found  
And wrap it around us

Love doesn't ask why

"She was living in a perfect house  
With pictures of smiling faces  
But there's a different story told inside  
Underneath it all  
With the sunglasses and makeup on

(No one even asked, is a something wrong?)  
So they wait  
Now she's gone

The power of one is stronger  
Why don't people seem to care at all  
As long as it's not about them

Don't you find that ironical  
When love is all we need  
Oh yeah

Singing the blues for money  
It's easy just to look the other way

Although she realized she'd sinned

As she followed him around

So overpowering was her love

The young girl's heart and soul and mind

Well feeling you're cool is as good as lookin? it  
Thinkin? your?re cool is as good as knowin? it  
Playin? it cool is as good as blowin? it  
You know you can't spend a dollar  
If you ain't got a dime  
You can't hook a fish if you ain't got a line  
You won't catch the bus if you're not there on time  
So go read up your books and sharpen your hooks  
Then all you need is money and a mouth full of honey  
And if you play your cards right after dancin? all night  
You won't have to walk home alone  
You won't have to walk home alone  
Boys you can hang loose and slip up real cool  
But if that lady has a love noose  
She might never let you go  
And if you think that maybe you're too young  
And you just can not cope  
The grab a razor sharp pair of cutting shears  
And cut a hole right in the rope  
Snip a hole right in the rope

Well feeling you're cool is as good as lookin? it  
Thinkin? your?re cool is as good as knowin? it

If you ain't got a dime  
You can't hook a fish if you ain't got a line  
You won't catch the bus if you're not there on time  
Well if you wake up tomorrow morning  
You can't remember what you did  
Just ring up some of your friends  
And they'll tell you just how low you slid  
Oh don't be ashamed of anything you hear  
After all you can't be blame  
When you're drinking so much beer  
Hey don't you worry  
That what you did just wasn't right  
Just remember brothers and sisters  
After every day?s another night  
Just remember brothers and sisters  
After every day?s another night

At sweet sixteen

Wouldn't let me off his merry-go-round  
  
I followed him around in traveling shows  
Along the main county lines  
Watching him drinking his mind away  
Not ever knowing my name at time  
Each night when the show closed down  
He used to tell me of his dreams  
He was wearing new French suits  
While I mended my torn jeans

Then one night in Santa Fe  
The horses stop going around  
There he was my poor rich man  
Lying on the Mexico ground

Is still spinning in my mind  
The carousel starts up again  
And I found my place in life

So if those tears start falling when you see us walking by  
I hope you won't forget who said goodbye

"The fortune queen of New Orleans,

On the backseat were scratches from  
The marks of men her fortune she had won  
Couldn't see through the tinted glass,  
She said ""home James"" and he hit the gas  
I followed her to some darkened room,  
She took my money, she said ""I'll be with you soon""  
  
Dark lady laughed and danced and lit the candles one by one  
Danced to her gypsy music till her brew was done  
Dark lady played back magic till the clock struck on the twelve  
She told me more about me than I knew myself  
  
She dealt two cards, a queen and a three  
And mumbled some words that were so strange to me  
Then she turned up a two-eyed jack,  
My eyes saw red but the card still stayed black  
She said the man you love is secretly true  
To someone else who is very close to you  
My advice is that you leave this place,  
Never come back and forget you ever saw my face  
  
Dark lady laughed and danced and lit the candles one by one  
Danced to her gypsy music till her brew was done  
Dark lady played back magic till the clock struck on the twelve  
She told me more about me than I knew myself  
  
So I ran home and crawled in my bed,  
I couldn't sleep because of all the things she said  
Then I remembered her strange perfume,  
And how I smelled it was in my own room!  
So I sneaked back and caught her with my man,  
Laughing and kissing till they saw the gun in my hand  
The next thing I knew they were dead on the floor,  
Dark lady would never turn a card up anymore  
  
Dark lady laughed and danced and lit the candles one by one  
Danced to her gypsy music till her brew was done  
Dark lady played back magic till the clock struck on the twelve  
She told me more about me than I knew myself

There was never a better time  
But you know those fires of Eden  
Still burn in this heart of mine  
  
The morning's uncertain  
It's a nervous day  
And I look for a reason  
Why I should feel this way  
  
I hear a voice run before  
Drifting through my open door  
Saying it's alright  
We're going to light those flames tonight  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And don't you wonder  
How we drifted so far  
When we belong to each other  
We were miles apart  
  
And there's a place  
That was meant for the two of us  
And when you touch the embers  
You feel my love  
As strong as it ever was

Home where my music's playing,  
Home where my love lies waiting  
Silently for me.

Of cigarettes and magazines.  
And each town looks the same to me, the movies and the factories  
And ev'ry stranger's face I see reminds me that I long to be,

Home where my thought's escaping,  
Home where my music's playing,  
Home where my love lies waiting

I'll play the game and pretend.  
But all my words come back to me in shades of mediocrity  
Like emptiness in harmony I need someone to comfort me.

For the thought that I caught that my head  
Was the event of the season  
Why in crowds  
Just a trace of my face  
Could seem so pleasin'  
I'll cop out to the change  
But a stranger is putting the tease on  
  
I was down on the ground  
When the messenger  
Wrote me a letter  
I was raised by the praise of a fan  
Who said I upset her  
Any girl in the world  
Could have easily known me much better  
She said  
You're strange, but don't change  
And I let her  
In a while when the smile on my face  
Turned to plaster  
Stick around while the clown who gets sick  
Does the trick of disaster  
For the race of my head and my face  
Is moving much faster  
  
Is it strange I should change  
I don't know  
Why don't you ask her  
Is it strange I should change  
  
I don't know, why don't you ask her  
Is it strange I should change  
I don't know, why don't you ask her  
Is it strange I should change

The deepest love you'll ever know  
  
Please don't close your ears

I spent the lonesome evening hours praying  
That you will change your mind

Come to your window  
Before our love comes crashing  
Into pieces on the ground  
Don't let it happen  
I promise you this time  
I'll never let you down  
Give me a cause to come  
To your lonesome arms again

Susan the plans they made put an end to you  
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song  
I just can't remember who to send it to  
  
I've seen fire and I've seen rain  
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end  
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend  
But I always thought that I'd see you again  
  
Won't you look down upon me, Jesus  
You've got to help me make a stand  
You've just got to see me through another day  
My body's aching and my time is at hand  
And I won't make it any other way  
  
Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain  
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end  
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend  
But I always thought that I'd see you again  
  
Been walking my mind to an easy time my back turned towards the sun  
Lord knows when the cold wind blows it'll turn you head around  
Well, there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come  
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground  
  
Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain  
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end  
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend  
But I always thought that I'd see you, baby, one more time again, now  
Thought I'd see you one more time again

"Here comes old Rosie she's looking mighty fine  
Here comes hot Nancy she's steppin' right on time  
There go the street lights bringin on the night  
Well they'll be slipping into darkness slipping out of sight  
All through the shadows they come and they go  
Only one thing in common  
They got the fire down below  
  
Here comes the rich man in his long black limousine  
Here comes the poor man all you got to have is green  
Here comes the lawyer, banker and the cop  
One thing for certain it ain't never gonna stop  
When it all gets too heavy  
That's when they come and go  
Only one thing in common  
They got the fire down below  
  
It happens out in Vegas happens in Moline  
On the blue blood streets of Boston  
Up in Berkeley and out in Queens  
And it went on yesterday and it's going on tonight  
Somewhere there's somebody ain't treatin' somebody right  
  
And he's looking out for Rosie and she's looking mighty fine  
And he's walking the streets for Nancy  
And he'll find her everytime  
When the street light flicker bringing on the night  
Well they'll be slipping into darkness slipping out of sight

Cause my legs, their prime has past.  
I am breaking from the sorrow

Mother, father, help me  
I'm your flesh and blood and bone.  
Don't you hear me?  
Can't you see me?  
Am I doomed to live alone?  
Without warmth, or love, or honor  
Like a dog out on the street,  
Am I trash 'cause I can't manage  
Must I grovel at your feet?  
  
I'm the boy who fought your battles  
And I'm the man who won your wars.  
Is it over?  
Have you used me?  
I'm no value anymore?  
  
I'm your mothers,  
Wives, and daughters  
I'm your fathers, husbands, sons,  
I'm the life's blood of this country  
I'm the hopeful precious ones.  
  
Am I nothing,  
Am I no one?  
Once a fabric,  
Now a rag.  
We treat people like they're nothing  
We're not fit to fly,  
Fit to fly  
No, no, no, no, no, no.  
  
We're not fit to fly,  
Fit to fly a flag (no, no, no)

See the world  
The Marine Corps,  
Join the Navy  
We're not fit to fly  
Fit to fly the flag.

"Flashback  
Writers jennifer hanson, jim patton-Johnson  
  
You were born between a rock and a hard place  
To a couple of losers  
I lived on the other side of your duplex  
I heard you getting those bruises  
I never would've wanted to walk in your shoes  
It scared me to death, I was a kid too  
Sometimes I think about you  
Travis are you out there somewhere  
Searching for somebody to care  
Are you doing the same thing  
That your daddy did to you  
Wish I could have helped you somehow  
Wonder if it's just too late now  
Saw your pain, how come nobody  
Seemed to have a clue  
Is your world still black and blue  
Travis, Travis  
Did you follow in your mama's footsteps  
Strung out on bad things  
Just a product of circumstances  
Never taught what love means  
Travis I hope you did it different this time  
All you had to do was make up your mind  
Well, how did you decide to live your life  
Travis are you out there somewhere  
Searching for somebody to care  
Are you doing the same thing  
That your daddy did to you  
Wish I could have helped you somehow  
Wonder if it's just too late now  
Saw your pain, how come nobody  
Seemed to have a clue  
Is your world still black and blue  
Travis, Travis  
And the circle goes round  
Until someone hears the sound  
Of a breaking heart  
Wish I could have helped you somehow  
Wonder if it's just too late  
Saw your pain, how come nobody  
Seemed to have a clue  
Is your world still black and blue

Till some wise guy brought a safety pin  
Now she wears a grin

Drink to the good times and hope my friend  
That they last  
  
So if you're feeling blue  
It's really nothing new  
And here's a lesson  
You should take from me  
Because it's free  
Just you remember friend,  
To find that happy end  
To find a pot of gold  
Where rainbows shine  
You got to take the time

A little ragged a little haggard  
A few wrinkles here and there  
But you should of seen her 21 years ago  
She would of captivated you  
Why she was Miss Subway of 1952  
She had a stunting figure  
And her hips weren't any bigger  
Than her bust line  
She's gotten just a little saggy  
And her skin's a trifle baggy  
But there was a time  
When everything was perfectly place  
She had a beautiful face  
She may look a little made up  
Especially around the eyes  
A little groupie, a little droopy  
But once they were quit a prize  
Yes you should of seen her 21 years ago  
They were a devastating view  
Why she was Miss Subway of 1952  
She had a million men around her  
Giving gifts that would astound her  
Why she couldn't even walk down the street  
Yeah she had lovers by the dozen  
And she even had some cousins  
Who just couldn't stop  
Throwing themselves at her feet  
She was so dainty and sweet

"[Diddy talking]  
I remember the first time I seen you moonwalk,  
I believed I could do anything,  
You made the world dance,  
You made the music come to life  
  
[Chris brown - Chorus]  
This the type of song that make the angels cry,  
I look up in the sky and I wonder why?  
Why you had to go, go  
I know its better on the other side,  
You were chosen from the sky  
Never gon let you go,

Whos Michael Jackson,  
Your Michael Jackson,  
I'm Michael Jackson,  
We all Michael Jackson,  
I guess what I'm asking is everybody bow their head for a legend don't breathe
for a second,  
Now let the air out, grab the hand of somebody you care about,  
So you can hear my message, my confession,  
Someone tell Usher, I seen the moonwalk, I guess the young thriller touched
him, like he touched me, like he touched you,  
So carry on his legacy, something I must do, so I trust you lighting candles,
concrete visuals, me and my brothers listen to jackson 5 in the living room,  
First thing I did when I heard was call puff,  
Cos him and Mike tried to stop the beef between us,  
Who was us? Me and fifty, that beef is dead, him and Mike Jackson gonna take
us to the ledge.  
  
[Chorus:]  
This the type of song that make the angels cry,  
I look up in the sky and I wonder why?  
Why you had to go, go  
I know its better on the other side,  
You were chosen from the sky  
Never gon let you go,  
  
As I'm pouring out this liquor candles start to flicker,  
When list my air ones, mj was my nier.  
Not the one that play ball, the one with the hollywood star,  
And since I'm a hollywood star I'm gonna tell you my story,  
Never had a family that close, never see Barry Gordy walking through
interscope,  
Just like me they always had Mike in a scope,  
No matter what you say,  
I'm gonna love him and hes still dope,  
Let me take you back to 85 when I was in a zone, dancing for my momma thriller
jacket with all the zippers on,  
Now I'm doing 90 bout to crash in this Aston,  
Listening to Outcast, I'm sorry Mrs Jackson  
Anything I can ever do to better you your son was our king so we wont Corretta
you,  
I'm writing this letter to all the Jackson kids, we all Jackson kids, time to
let us through.

I love women and power, we used to sit and talk for hours  
On the balcony, my condo play your favorite, shawty  
No love lost, just the perfect soulmate, that's all  
It's my fault, caught in a rupture  
Should've been you I was touchin', I knew it wasn't  
My ego, I was buzzin' but not how you wanted  
Too busy tryna flaunt it, like I just bought it  
You know them bitches 'round you can't hold water  
This s'posed to be our moment  
These pills set it, I'm feelin' better  
Called you to tell you I love you  
But you too busy with some other shit, I'm guessin'  
No texts, no proof, no voice messages  
How we become enemies so effortless?  
Or was I blind when you was naked?  
Or high when you was level  
Know time is of the essence  
No lie, I live and regret it  
Decisions I made, embedded in my mind  
Hate to admit it, but I gotta say it one time  
  
[Hook: Chris Brown]  
Should've treated you right  
But every night I was livin' life in the fast lane  
I should've put my focus on you  
In the club every night  
I just get it wrong when you do right  
And I keep just fillin' your head with the lies  
This shit comes with a price  
A nigga should've loved you better  
A nigga should've loved you better  
A nigga should've loved you better  
A nigga should've loved you

What happened to me, babe?  
This ain't who you fell in love with  
You say you need space  
Don't do this  
Just look at me, one more time  
I know I fucked up but I'm tryin' to please you  
I'ma give you all  
And your heartache and pain's gonna stop

Don't walk away  
There is no one left to call  
Don't wanna be alone when you disappear

how never feel like we vibin'

She make wanna leave the one I'm with Usher Raymond  
  
Probably didn't register, don't trip, later on it will  
Shorty full of drama like gangsta grizzles

Like Tina did Ike in the limo, it finally hit me  
I got a new chick, and she ain't you

But she looked like the type I was into  
And I wanted to holla but she was wit her mama  
Felt like a catch 22  
Okay how should I step to her, (how should I step to her)  
Without any disrespect to her  
But I thought she would like  
If I kept it polite  
So I stepped and this is what I said to her

Excuse me mamma (hey)  
Your daughters fine (your daughter's fine)  
And If I could I'd like a moment of her time (a moment of her time)  
While I was shopping I saw her walking by  
So can I get her number and I'll give her mine?

Wishin I could catch her by herself  
Waitin til she wasn't with nobody else  
Now every time I saw her  
I was tryin to call her  
And she was busy checkin for the sales  
Part of me was like just let it go  
The other part of me was like let her know  
But I will never get this chance  
My life again gotta man up and tell her so

And I slip as we dip into a rare bliss  
  
Mama used to warn me  
To beware of those Latin lovers  
She said I gave my heart too soon  
And that's how I became your mother  
I said hey mama, you seem to forget  
I'm not in love yet  
Sweet talk don't win me over  
But I realized  
Big brown eyes can hypnotize  
When he says  
  
I am full blood boricua  
Reads the tattoo on his arm  
He tells me, mami I need ya  
And my heartbeat pumps so strong  
Getting lost in el ritmo  
He whispers te quiero, te quiero  
I begin to give in with no hesitation  
Can't help my infatuation  
(Ah ah, ah ah, ah ah)  
It's pure infatuation  
(Ah ah, ah ah, ah ah)  
Hey  
  
Skin the color of cinnamon  
His eyes light up and I melt within  
Feels so good it must be a sin  
I can't stop what I started  
I'm giving in  
He brings life to my fantasies  
Sparks a passion inside of me  
Finds the words when I can not speak  
In the silence, his heartbeat is music to me  
  
Mama used to warn me  
Not to rush love with another  
She said I'm not trying to lecture  
I just care about my daughter  
Ay mama, you seem to forget  
I never will let  
A man control my emotions  
But when he smiles (when he smiles)  
I feel like a little child  
When he says  
  
I am full blood boricua  
Reads the tattoo on his arm (whoa, whoa)  
He tells me, mami I need ya  
And my heartbeat pumps so strong (so strong)  
Getting lost in el ritmo  
He whispers te quiero, te quiero  
I begin to give in with no hesitation  
Can't help my infatuation  
(Ah ah, ah ah, ah ah)  
It's pure infatuation  
(Ah ah, ah ah, ah ah)  
  
Caught between my mama's words  
And what I feel inside  
I'm wanting to explore his world  
But a part of me wants to hide  
Should I risk it, can't resist it  
This has caught me by surprise  
Should I, let him take me to Puerto Rico  
I can't hold back no more  
Let's go tonight  
Ooh, hey  
  
You adore me, never be lonely, oh  
  
I am full blood boricua (boricua)  
Reads the tattoo on his arm (on his arm)  
He tells me, mami I need ya  
And my heartbeat pumps so strong (so strong)  
Getting lost in el ritmo  
He whispers te quiero, te quiero (oh, quiero)  
I begin to give in with no hesitation  
Can't help my infatuation  
  
I can't help, what I'm feeling  
Infatuated  
Oh oh, oh

Every single rhyme  
So here I stand today

And so to God I pray that he will give me strength  
To carry forward the gift of song in his good faith  
In his good faith  
  
I'm going back to basics  
To where it all began  
I'm ready now to face it  
I wanna understand  
What made the soul singers  
And the blues figures  
That inspired a higher generation  
The jazz makers, and the ground breakers  
They gave so much of themselves and dedication

"Song Lyrics  
What if I never knew  
What if I never found you  
I'd never had this feeling  
In my heart  
  
How did this come to be  
I don't know how you found me  
But from the moment I saw you  
Deep inside my heart  
I knew  
  
Baby, you're my destiny  
You and I were meant to be  
With all my heart and soul  
I give my love to have and hold  
And as far as I can see  
You were always meant to be  
My destiny  
  
I wanted someone like you  
Someone that I could hold onto  
And give my love  
Until the end of time  
  
But forever was just a word  
Something I'd only heard about  
But now you're always there for me  
When you say forever  
I'll believe  
  
Baby, you're my destiny  
You and I were meant to be  
With all my heart and soul  
I give my love to have and hold  
And as far as I can see  
You were always meant to be  
My destiny  
  
Maybe all we need  
Is just a little faith.  
Cause baby, I believe  
That love will find a way.  
Hey..  
  
Oh baby, you're my destiny  
You and I were meant to be  
With all my heart and soul  
I give my love to have and hold

From now till eternity  
You were always meant to be

We're making love or in a fight  
Sometimes you make me so blue  
  
But then it feels so good I knew it would  
You know the way to make me crazy  
I want to give it to you  
  
You make me feel so emotional  
I can't let go I'm so emotional  
I'm sinking deep into an ocean full of you  
I'm so emotional  
  
You take me high and low you know  
I'm never sure which way you're gonna go  
You're such a mystery to me  
  
But baby hot or cold, you got a hold  
Of my imagination  
I think you know what i mean  
  
You make me feel so emotional  
I can't let go I'm so emotional  
I'm sinking deep into an ocean full of you  
I'm so emotional

Suddenly the sun comes out  
Sometimes north or south of love

"When they push when they pull  
Tell me you can hold on

That it's wrong  
Will you love you for you  
At the end of it all  
  
In life there's going to be times

Don't be scared to fly alone  
Find a path that is your own

Don't hold back and always know  
All the answers will unfold  
What are you waiting for  
Spread your wings and soar  
  
The boy who wonders  
Is he good enough for them  
Keeps tryin' to please em' all  
But he just never seems to fit in  
Then there's the girl who thinks  
She'll never be good enough for him  
Keeps tryin' to change  
And that's a game she'll never win  
  
Now In life there's going to be times  
When you're feeling low

With her fears  
Her reflection-so foreign to her  
After all these years  
All of her life she has tried to be something  
Besides herself  
Now time has passed  
And she's ended up someone else with regret  
  
What is it in us that makes us feel the need  
To keep pretending  
Gotta let ourselves be

He can even give her some head, or sex her off

Cats take my ideas, and put their name on it

And ripped our future from my grasp,  
why can't you say, you want me back,  
So everything can be like our past....  
And love me again!

When I was young every Christmas Eve  
I could not sleep  
Trying to catch that old St. Nick  
Leaving presents under my tree  
And every year I'd fall asleep laying in my bed  
Dreaming of a million sugarplums  
Dancing in my head  
  
Oh how much joy it is at Christmas time  
The spirit of giving is in our lives  
Oh, oh how much joy it brings to see the ones you love  
This year's gonna be the best Christmas because  
  
There'll be family and Christmas cheer (oh ooh)  
Peace and goodwill to all men (ooh)  
Everybody is home for Christmas  
Everybody is home (everybody is home)  
Sneaking a kiss under the mistletoe  
I want a white Christmas so let it snow (let it snow)  
Everybody is home for Christmas (oooh)  
Everybody is home for Christmastime  
  
Friends come together as we decorate the tree  
This is the time of year to live in harmony  
Angels watch over as we put the kids to sleep  
And when they awake their smiling faces  
Make it all complete, oh  
  
This is the holiday you're with the family  
We put aside our differences and let it be  
Oh, oh how much fun it is to give and to receive  
This time of year, love is all we need, ohh  
  
There'll be family (family) and Christmas cheer (oh)

"Well I thought I knew you, thinkin' that you were true  
Guess I, I couldn't trust called your bluff time is up  
'Cause I've had enough  
You were there by my side, always down for the ride  
But your joy ride just came down in flames cause your greed sold me out in
shame  
  
After all of the stealing and cheating you probably think that  
I hold resentment for you  
But uh uh, oh no, you're wrong  
'Cause if it wasn't for all that you tried to do, I wouldn't know  
Just how capable I am to pull through  
So I want to say thank you  
Cause it  
  
[Chorus]  
'Cause it makes me that much stronger  
Makes me work a little bit harder  
It makes me that much wiser  
So thanks for making me a fighter  
Made me learn a little bit faster  
Made my skin a little bit thicker  
Makes me that much smarter  
So thanks for making me a fighter  
  
Never saw it coming, all of your backstabbing  
Just so you could cash in on a good thing before I'd realize your game  
I heard you're goin' round playin', the victim now  
But don't even begin feeling I'm the one to blame  
'Cause you dug your own grave  
After all of the fights and the lies cause you're wanting to haunt me  
But that won't work anymore, no more,  
It's over  
'Cause if it wasn't for all of your torture  
I wouldn't know how to be this way now and never back down  
So I want to say thank you  
Cause it  
  
[Chorus]  
  
How could this man I thought I knew  
Turn out to be unjust so cruel  
Could only see the good in you  
Pretended not to know the truth  
You tried to hide your lies, disguise yourself  
Through living in denial  
But in the end you'll see  
You won't stop me  
  
I am a fighter and I  
I ain't goin' stop  
There is no turning back  
I've had enough

You thought I would forget,

You thought I would forget,

Just leave ev'rything to me  
Though it wont be like the first time  
How can it be like the first time?  
But why does it have to be?

For love is only love  
You touch and still you touch the proud  
Don't listen for those bells  
For love is only love  
And if it's love you've found  
Your heart won't hear a sound  
And you hold his hand  
You only hold his hand  
The violins are all a bluff  
But if you're really wise  
The silence of his eyes  
Will tell you  
Love is only love  
And it's wonderful enough  
Without the shooting star  
Without the sounds of bells  
Without the violins  
Love is wonderful enough!

There's no shoulder here to lean on

"I've had nothing but bad luck  
Since the day I saw the cat at my door  
So I came here to you, sweet lady  
Answering your mystical call  
Crystal ball on the table  
Showing the future, the past  
Same cat with them evil eyes  
And I knew it was a spell she'd cast.

She's just a devil woman  
With evil on her mind  
Beware the devil woman  
She's gonna get you  
She's just a devil woman  
With evil on her mind  
Beware the devil woman  
She's gonna get you from behind.  
  
Give me the ring on your finger  
Let me see the lines of your hand  
I can see me a tall dark stranger  
Giving you what you hadn't planned  
I drank the potion she offered me  
I found myself on the floor  
Then I looked in those big green eyes  
And I wondered what I came there for.  
  
[Chorus])  
  
Stay awake  
Look out  
If you're out on a moonlit night  
Be careful of the neighborhood strays  
Of a lady with long black hair  
Tryin' to win you with her feminine ways  
Crystal ball on the table  
Showing the future, the past  
Same cat with them evil eyes  
You'd better get out of there fast  
She's just a devil woman  
With evil on her mind  
Beware the devil woman  
She's gonna get you.

It just isn't fair, isn't fair

No one can move me  
The way that you do  
Nothing erases the feeling between me and you

If you go away, if you go away, if you go away, if you go away  
  
If you go away, as I know you must  
There is nothing left in this world to trust  
Just an empty room, full of empty space

I'd have been the shadow of your shadow  
If you might have kept me by your side  
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away.

"Worked with a woman named Minnie  
One Christmas eve long ago  
When I asked ""What you doing this evening ?""  
Minnie took on a seasonal glow  
She said she'd be waiting for Santa  
She'd be wearing a bright red bow  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Minnie And Santa  
Minnie And Santa  
What they're up to only  
Heaven knows she wrote on a card  
""Don't take it so hard we're headed for the North Pole""  
  
Now Minnie could not be persuaded  
That Santa just did not exist  
She swore if she put up some mistletoe  
Santa did come give her a kiss  
And there where she'd hung up her stockings  
All in their silky, soft, sheen  
She'd be laying in wait on a bear skin rug  
Where the cookies and milk could be seen  
  
Minnie And Santa  
Minnie And Santa  
What they're up to only  
Heaven knows she wrote on a card  
""Don't take it so hard we're headed for the North Pole""  
  
Now Minnie was older and wiser  
Like a dear old Auntie to me  
But the night that she ran off with Santa  
Was a real epiphany  
  
Minnie And Santa  
Minnie And Santa  
What they're up to only  
Heaven knows she wrote on a card  
""Don't take it so hard we're headed for the North Pole""  
  
Next Xmas I passed by the bakery  
Staring out from on top of a cake  
Was jolly old Santa with a big silly grin  
And a gal in silk stockings and lace  
Oh, Minnie and Santa...

Chances are a million to one  
You got me startin' to believe

"In the bosom of europa

Playing underneath her dress  
She saw the great caruso  
And that's when she fell in love  
She'd think of him as elvis  
If she knew who elvis was  
  
Spinning round and round  
You can hear her moan  
She's all by herself  
But she's not alone  
  
Wonderful things happen to me  
Whenever I sing that white man's melody  
Wonderful wave - wash over me  
Whenever I sing that white man's melody

She was floating on her bed  
She was deaming of al jolson  
And what she thought he said  
  
He was looking in the mirror  
He was putting on the paint  
Said the hardest thing about this job  
Is being what you ain't  
  
Just an old white man  
In a strange new world  
Can you come out tonight  
Little buffalo girl  
  
Wonderful things happen to me  
Whenever I sing that white man's melody  
Wonderful wave - wash over me  
Whenever I sing that white man's melody  
  
From the loins of the liberace  
Sprang a million little tunes  
And they whirled around eliza  
Like so many little moons  
Every jewel held a secret  
Every flourish held a clue  
As he held her in a rapture  
Singing I'll be seeing you  
  
Wonderful things happen to me

Wonderful wave - wash over me

Stolen from the sky

Tear apart hate

Slips away

Carrying guns, not books  
Drug dealing, not learning  
The golden rule

Not just the same  
Castle in the sky  
Haunted by white-sheeted ghouls  
Filled with hate me  
And hate you  
And proud of it too

Running down the block  
Rock throwing, not knowing

That whip cracking  
I cry out tears of anger  
I cry out tears of shame

People rushing endlessly  
Sometimes I think it's just their way  
Of capturing a better day  
You keep rushing home baby  
For your dose of reality  
I'll hold out my hands to you  
You do what you need to  
  
Ohh, whoa  
I will comfort you (I will comfort you)  
Ohh, whoa  
I will comfort you (I will comfort you)  
  
An ocean of humanity  
Some wash up along the street  
It's hard to keep in stepping round  
It's hard to keep that frame of mind  
Trying to move with the sun  
Gives the illusion that we're one  
I'll be running next to you  
We do what we need to  
  
Ohh, whoa  
I will comfort you (I will comfort you)  
Ohh, whoa  
I will comfort you (I will comfort you)  
  
But when the moonlight washes over our bed  
And the road slows  
A lonely siren screeching 'round the bend  
The cool air blows  
Raising the hair on my skin  
We come face to face  
Try to let each other in  
  
Ohh, whoa  
I will comfort you (I will comfort you)  
Ohh, whoa  
I will comfort you (I will comfort you)

"Oh the hills are full of spirits

When the moon is shining down  
And ramona loves the orchard  
And liza loves the pine  
And cyrus in the moonlight  
Loves the flowing of the wine  
  
Oh cyrus trusts the spirits  
And they fill his life with grace  
Yeah the father of his fathers  
Passed him down the gift of faith  
And one night you might hear it  
Like a wailing from above  
It's just cyrus in the moonlight  
Singing to the one he loves...  
  
And the two girls start to dancing  
When they hear that drunken voice  
That's when cyrus asks the moonlight  
Do I have to make a choice  
'tween liza with her red hair  
And ramona with her blues  
And with all these gifts they bring me  
Tell me how can I refuse

Move to the right, and

Moving to the break of day  
Dancing with a stranger

You can't define yourself in terms of someone else.  
You can't say what you're thinking?

"Long time ago in Bethlehem, so the Holy Bible say,  
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ, was born on Christmas Day.  
  
Hark, now hear the angels sing, a king was born today,  
And man will live for evermore, because of Christmas Day.  
  
While shepherds watch their flocks by night,  
They see a bright new shining star,  
They hear a choir sing a song,  
The music seemed to come from afar.  
  
Now Joseph and his wife, Mary,  
Came to Bethlehem that night,  
They found no place to bear her child,  
Not a single room was in sight.  
  
Hark, now hear the angels sing, a king was born today,  
And man will live for evermore, because of Christmas Day.  
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ, was born on Christmas Day.  
  
And then they found a little nook in a stable all forlorn,  
And in a manger cold and dark, Mary's little boy was born.  
  
Hark, now hear the angels sing, a king was born today,  
And man will live for evermore, because of Christmas Day.  
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ, was born on Christmas Day

So be good for goodness sake  
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry  
Better not pout, I'm telling you why  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
  
With little tin horns and little toy drums  
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo  
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee  
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree  
So! You better watch out, you better not cry  
Better not pout, I'm telling you why  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
  
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play  
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day  
You'd better write your letter now  
And mail it right away  
Because he's getting ready  
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Keepin' your balance by a single thread...  
Keepin' your heart strings tight and pure

Until you're sore and still you're sore when do you soar...

Sometimes it's hanging in the balance or  
Dancing in the shadow like a silhouette

They just go on thinking it's a natural thing  
Some people throw their hands in the sky

Dropping like flies everything that's come to pass  
All the time we thought would last.

Drowned by the props all steely sunshine  
Sick of you, sick of me  
Lust for the free life  
Quashed and maimed  
Like a valuable loved one  
Left unnamed

Sunshine on the wasteland  
Old man sitting in the white sand  
Think we're in for a big surprise  
Right between the eyes  
  
Seemed a good idea  
To drop a bomb on the wasteland here  
Only one man could be seen  
And he was old and so serene  
Captain sat in his deck chair  
And the red light flashed Beware  
Pilot felt quite big-time  
As the bomb sailed through the air  
Well, they danced and sang  
When the bang went bang  
When the lights popped out  
And the smoke began to clear  
It was positively queer

""Die"" said the General  
""Cobblers"" said the man  
So the Pentagon sent a cable  
And the Queen a telegram  
A-bombs, H-bombs, even very small ones  
Ripped apart that sand  
'Til the stench was just revolting  
And the sky a greenish tan  
But the soldier said ""Sir,  
There's a crack in the world""  
And the figures went ""squash"",  
And the bits flew far and wide  
How the universe sighed!

When the smoke had blown away  
There was nothing left to view  
Except a man dear Lord who looked like you  
Floating high up in the sky

Stab you from the city spires

Don't let me know we're invisible

"I bless you madly,  
Sadly as I tie my shoes  
I love you badly,  
Just in time, at times, I guess  
Because of you I need to rest  
Because it's you  
That sets the test  
  
So much has gone  
And little is new  
And as the sparrow sings  
Dawn chorus for  
Someone else to hear  
The Thinker sits alone growing older  
And so bitter  
  
""I gave Them life  
I gave Them all  
They drained my very soul  
...Dry  
I crushed my heart  
To ease their pains  
No thought for me remains there  
Nothing can they spare  
What of me?  
Who praised their efforts  
To be free?  
Words of strength and care  
And sympathy  
I opened doors  
That would have blocked their way  
I braved their cause to guide,  
For little pay  
  
I ravaged at my finance just for those  
Those whose claims were steeped in peace, tranquility  
Those who said a new world, new ways ever free  
Those whose promises stretched in hope and grace for me""  
  
I bless you madly,  
Sadly as I tie my shoes  
I love you badly, just in time,  
At times, I guess  
Because of you I need to rest, oh yes  
Because it's you  
That sets the test  
  
So much has gone  
And little is new  
And as the sunrise stream  
Flickers on me,  
My friends talk  
Of glory, untold dream, where all is God and God is just a word  
  
""We had a friend, a talking man  
Who spoke of many powers that he had  
Not of the best of men, but ours  
  
We used him  
We let him use his powers  
We let him fill our needs  
Now we are strong  
  
And the road is coming to its end  
Now the damned have no time to make amends  
No purse of token fortune stands in our way  
The silent guns of love  
Will blast the sky  
We broke the ruptured structure built of age  
Our weapons were the tongues of crying rage  
  
Where money stood  
We planted seeds of rebirth  
And stabbed the backs of fathers  
Sons of dirt  
  
Infiltrated business cesspools  
Hating through our sleeves  
Yea, and we slit the Catholic throat  
Stoned the poor  
On slogans such as  
  
'Wish You Could Hear'  
'Love Is All We Need'  
'Kick Out The Jams'  
'Kick Out Your Mother'  
'Cut Up Your Friend'  
'Screw Up Your Brother or He'll Get You In the End'  
  
And we know the flag of love is from above  
And we can force you to be free  
And we can force you to believe""  
  
And I close my eyes and tighten up my brain  
For I once read a book in which the lovers were slain  
For they knew not the words of the Free States' refrain  
It said:  
""I believe in the power of good  
I believe in the state of love  
I will fight for the right to be right  
I will kill for the good of the fight for the right to be right""  
  
And I open my eyes to look around  
And I see a child laid slain  
On the ground  
As a love machine lumbers through desolation rows  
Plowing down man, woman, listening to its command  
But not hearing anymore  
Not hearing anymore  
Just the shrieks from the old rich  
  
And I want to believe  
In the madness that calls 'Now'  
And I want to believe  
That a light's shining through  
Somehow  
  
And I want to believe  
And you want to believe  
And we want to believe  
And we want to live  
Oh, we want to live

Hung up on romancing  
  
We bought a lot of things  
To keep you warm and dry  
And a funny old crib on which the paint won't dry  
I bought you a pair of shoes  
A trumpet you can blow  
And a book of rules  
On what to say to people  
When they pick on you  
'Cause if you stay with us you're gonna be pretty Kookie too

And if you ever have to go to school  
Remember how they messed up  
This old fool  
Don't pick fights with the bullies  
Or the cads  
'Cause I'm not much cop at punching other people's Dads  
And if the homework brings you down  
Then we'll throw it on the fire  
And take the car downtown

Cologne she'll wear. Silver and Americard  
She'll drive a beetle car  
And beat you down at cool Canasta

She will be your living end

In a drunken town fight

That can swallow the moon

With his arms open wide  
""Hey, bring me more fish  
Throw it down by my side""  
And he wants so to belch  
But he's too full to try  
So he stands up and laughs  
And he zips up his fly

Paunches bursting their pants  
Grinding women to porch

That their whiskey voice croaked  
Splitting the night  
With the roar of their jokes  
And they turn and they dance  
And they laugh and they lust  
Till the rancid sound of the accordion bursts  
And then out of the night  
With their pride in their pants  
And the sluts that they tow  
Underneath the street lamp

There's a sailor who drinks  
And he drinks and he drinks  
And he drinks once again  
He'll drink to the health  
Of the whores of Amsterdam  
Who've given their bodies  
To a thousand other men  
Yeah, they've bargained their virtue  
Their goodness all gone  
For a few dirty coins  
When he just can't go on

Aims it up above

"Up until one century ago there lived,  
In the Zi Duang provence of eastern country  
A glass-like spider.  
Having devoured its prey it would drape the skeletons over its web,  
In weeks creating a macabre  
  
Shrine of remains  
Its web was also unique in that it had many layers,  
Like floors in a building  
  
At the top of this palace-like place, assembled with almost apparent  
Care, were tiny, shining objects, glass, beads, dew-drops.  
One could almost call it an altar.  
When the breeze blew through this construction,  
It produced sounds of wailing, crying.  
Tiny wails, tiny cries.  
  
The baby spiders would get scared and search frantically  
For their mother.  
But the Glass Spider would have long gone, having known that the babies  
Would survive someone on their own.  
Oh-The Glass Spider had blue eyes almost like-a human's.  
They shed tears at the wintered turn of the centuries.  
  
Don't you hear this wasted cry, Life is over you

But you've seen who's in heaven. Is there anyone in hell  
(Mummy come back 'cause it's dark now)

"Was walking through the counters of a national concern  
And a cash machine was spitting by my shoulder  
  
And I saw the multitude of faces, honest, rich and clean  
As the merchandise exchanged and money roared  
And a woman hot with worry slyly slipped a tin of stewing steak  
Into the paper bag at her side  
And her face was white with fear in case her actions were observed  
So she closed her eyes to keep her conscience blind  
  
Crying

Then she moved toward the exit clutching tightly at her paper bag  
Perspiration trickled down her forehead  
And her heart it leapt inside her as the hand laid on her shoulder  
She was led away bewildered and amazed  
Through her deafened ears the cash machines were shrieking on the counter  
As her escort asked her softly  
For her name  
And a crowd of honest people rushed to help a tired old lady  
Who had fainted to the whirling  
Wooden floor

Lucy can't dance to the noise but she knows what the noise can do

Don't recognize anyone  
But you've still got me under your thumb  
Lucy can't dance to the noise but she knows what the noise can do  
Pursuing your frenzy in Ritz or Savoy  
In this sexual noise, vicious chords offer joy  
You live and you die in the blink of an eye  
Well I can't make you dance  
Dance to the noise  
Lucy can't dance but she knows what the noise can do  
Dance to the noise  
Lucy can't dance but she knows what the noise can do  
Lucy I know what you're going to going to do  
But you can't buy me off in this serial world  
Who who who died and made you material girl?  
Lucy can't dance to the noise but she knows what the noise can do  
So I'll spin while my lunatic lyric goes wrong  
Guess I'll put all my eggs in a postmodern song  
Lucy can't dance to the noise but she knows what the noise can do  
Or this shallow orb mugged by reality  
Just a few simple words like I love you, I need you  
Live and you die in the blink of an eye  
Still I can't make you dance  
Dance to the noise  
Lucy can't dance but she knows what the noise can do

"The children of the summer's end  
Gathered in the dampened grass,  
We played Our songs and felt the London sky  
Resting on our hands  
It was God's land.  
It was ragged and naive.  
It was Heaven.  
  
Touch, we touched the very soul  
Of holding each and every life.  
We claimed the very source of joy ran through.  
It didn't, but it seemed that way.  
I kissed a lot of people that day.  
  
Oh, to capture just one drop of all the ecstasy that swept that afternoon,  
To paint that love upon a white balloon,  
And fly it from the toppest top of all the tops that man has pushed beyond his  
Brain.  
Satoria must be something just the same.  
  
We scanned the skies with rainbow eyes and saw machines of every shape and
size.  
We talked with tall Venusians passing through.  
And Peter tried to climb aboard but the Captain shook his head  
And away they soared,  
Climbing through the ivory vibrant cloud.  
Someone passed some bliss among the crowd.  
And we walked back to the road, unchained.

"In the cool of the evening  
When I was a boy  
I would gaze at the wide open skies  
And I'd dream of a someday  
When I'd be a man  
And live with a lady with lights in her eyes  
Well, I searched for that dream  
Till my heart nearly broke  
Till my hopes turned to hopeless and died  
Until just this morning when I suddenly woke  
Looked at you sleeping there and cried  
  
This is what I dreamed  
This is what I wished for  
Now all at once I see  
Everything I've ever wanted  
Is here with me  
  
Yes, this is what I dreamed  
Like a miracle unfolding  
Holding you near me  
Just like this  
  
Every moment, every kiss  
Is exactly how I pictured it would be  
I swear I must be dreamin'  
For this is what I dreamed, ooh  
  
And it's everywhere around us  
Every cloud in the sky  
Every breeze that blows by  
Can't believe I've been so blind  
To this sweet bliss  
  
Yes this is what I dreamed  
And I just can't help but wonder  
If under those same magic skies  
You were closing your eyes  
And dreaming of this moment with me  
My life is wide awake now  
For this is what I dreamed ooh  
  
This is what I dreamed  
This is what I dreamed

I sit beside our bed  
Watching you sleeping so sweetly

There's no one in this whole world  
Inspires me the way that you do  
Undying admiration  
Undying admiration  
I'll sing it to the night  
I'll sing until the light

And when the morning comes  
And a little child appears  
Hearing the love in your laughter  
Sometimes I just have to hold back the tears  
  
The passion on your face  
The depth of your soul  
Would inspire any muse to lose control  
There's no one in this whole world  
That teaches me the way that you do  
  
Undying admiration  
Undying admiration  
I'll write it on the sky  
And tell the world of my  
Undying admiration  
  
All my life I've waited for  
The kind of love  
Keats and Shelley would be jealous of  
And it's you baby  
You made it all come true baby

On that enchanted train  
The passing scenery didn't get a glance  
We held hands completely light hearted  
Off to a winter romance  
  
We danced that night by candle light  
The world was white with snow  
The way we felt we never felt  
The snow could melt and go  
But though the snow is gone the romance lingers on  
And those that said it didn't stand a chance  
Will know when they see us together  
That love's not been controlled by the weather  
And all of our summers we'll have our winter romance

And love grew up  
A small cloud passes overhead  
And cries down in the flower bed

"I've grown accustomed to her face  
She almost makes the day begin  
I've grown accustomed to the tune she whistles night and noon  
Her smiles, her frowns, her ups and downs  
Are second nature to me now  
Like breathing out and breathing in  
I was serenely independent and content before we met  
Surely I could always be that way again and yet  
I've grown accustomed to her looks, accustomed to her voice  
Accustomed to her face  
  
She's second nature to me now  
Like breathing out and breathing in  
I'm very grateful she's a woman and so easy to forget  
Rather like a habit one can always break and yet  
I've grown accustomed to the trace of something in the air  
Accustomed to her face

No one else will do it for you you're on your own  
Do it

Don't send a friend who's true to pitch your woo for you or you'll rue it

"One time in South America  
Met a boy in Colombia  
Couldn't understand a word he said  
So he took my hand instead  
It was late as we ignored the time  
Now I can't get this stranger off my mind  
I think about him when I wear this dress  
I still smell him in my hair  
  
Was it that him making you sweat  
Was it the beat of the drum on my heart and my chest  
  
Eres muy bonita y sed  
No puedo esperar a verte otra vez  
I can't wait till I see you again  
Besame mucho princesa  
And then we dance  
  
He said, besame mucho,  
He kisses my head and we dance  
  
It was time for me to say goodbye  
Couldn't stand to look him in the eye  
Would've kissed him if I had the time  
Could've have sworn it was on his mind  
Was it his lips, the way he moves his ways  
Hands on my hips,  
Oh just a look of desire on his face  
  
Eres muy bonita y sed  
No puedo esperar a verte otra vez  
I can't wait till I see you again  
Besame mucho princesa  
And then we dance  
  
He said, besame mucho,  
He kisses my head  
And then I  
I close my eyes  
For a moment in time  
In the blink of the night  
I submit the crown  
He was young until it found  
When I turned around  
But I swear I can still hear him now  
  
Eres muy bonita y sed  
No puedo esperar a verte otra vez  
I can't wait till I see you again  
Besame mucho princesa  
And then we dance

As the smoke clears  
I awaken  
And untangle you from me  
Would it make you

Still are broken

Watch you disappear ya yaa  
Go run run run

Sing that cold melody.

Grip it tighter, and don't let it go

Negatively about us,  
But they can't say another word  
But they'll realize,  
Jealousy has taken over their minds  
And the words they try to break me down with  
They only make us stronger.  
  
Did you feel that breeze?  
A tide of chills just swept over me  
It must of been from the brush of your hand  
Pull me into your arms  
A little closer baby  
I wanna see you standing  
Next to me  
  
So take a walk with me,  
But keep the pace down  
I don't want this night to end  
Can't we runaway together?  
  
Passions taking over skies  
Leaving sand behind for them to choke on  
And they'll try to speak  
Negatively about us,  
But they can't say another word...

"I remember when  
I was five and you were ten, boy  
You knew that I was shy  
So you teased and made me cry  
But I loved you  
  
Then one day you came  
You told me you were leaving  
You gave your folks the blame  
And made me cry again  
When you said  
  
Little girl  
Please don't wait for me  
Wait patiently for love  
Someday will surely come  
Ooh, little girl  
Please don't wait for me

I'm just a fool  
Ooh, I'm a fool  
To keep waiting  
  
Then someone finally came  
He told me that he loved me  
I put him off with lies  
He could see I had no eyes  
So he left me once again alone  
Like a child without her playmate  
I had to face the truth  
I was still in love with you  
But you said:  
  
Little girl  
Please don't wait for me  
Wait patiently for love  
Someday will surely come  
Ooh, little girl  
Please don't wait for me  
Wait patiently for love

I've been living on your memory  
In a world where we were one

I'm watching you tonight

You can say goodbye if you want to  
I love you but I'll try to understand  
But in my soul I know it's meant to be  
Together you and me

Like voices in the wind  
And I wonder if you feel my love  
It's stronger than it's ever been  
  
I'm watching you tonight

All the love we gave eternally  
Now it's dying in the sun

Causing my heart complication,  
Love is a growing infection,  
And I don't know the correction,  
Got me rocking and a-reeling,  
And I can't shake the feeling.  
Love Is Like An Itching In My Heart,  
tearing it all apart,  
Just an Itching in my heart,  
And, baby, I can't scratch it.

"I've got a man, his name is Pe-ete  
He's awfully good and oh so sweet  
He's not the kind that you usually meet  
He loves me so-o and I love Pete  
A gal that I know loves a boy named Ji-im  
Though he treats her mean she still loves him  
And Sally loves Joe who's the kind that'll cheat  
Some men are like that but not my Pete  
He never beats me  
Never mistreats me  
He never teases  
He only pleases  
I take my troubles with a grain of salt  
'Cause I've got a man without a fault  
I put him on trial, he passed every te-est  
Whatever he does, he does his best  
I've got no complaints and my life is complete  
'Cause I've got a man whose name is Pete  
He never beats me  
Never mistreats me

"Pillow Talk  
Doris Day  
Written by Buddy Pepper and Inez James  
This song did not chart  
Title song from the 1959 film starring Day and Rock Hudson  
  
Pillow talk, pillow talk  
Another night of hearin' myself talk, talk, talk, talk  
Wonder how it would be to have someone to pillow talk with me  
I wonder how  
I wonder who  
Pillow talk, pillow talk  
Another night of bein' alone with pillow talk  
When it's all said and done, two heads together can be better than one  
That's what they say  
They always say  
All I do is talk to my pillow  
Talk to my pillow, talk to my pillow  
All I do is talk to my pillow  
Talk about the boy I'm gonna marry someday  
Somehow, some way, sometime  
Pillow talk, pillow talk  
Another night of gettin' my fill of pillow talk  
You and I both agree there must be a boy, must be a pillow  
Must be a pillow-talkin' boy for me  
I hope I'm right  
I'd better be right  
Oh, there must be a pillow-talkin' boy for me  
(We hope she's right, she'd better be right, there must be a boy)  
There must be a boy  
There must be a boy  
There must be a boy  
There MUST be a boy!!  
There MUST!!

"(Irish folk song sang by Dusty on her TV show in 1967)  
  
Where Lagan stream sings lullaby  
There grows a young man fair  
The twilight gleam is in his eye  
The night is on his hair  
And like a lovesick lenan he  
He hath my heart in thrall  
No life I owe, no liberty  
His love is lord of all  
  
And often when the beetles' horn  
Hath lulled the eve to sleep  
I steal unto his shieling lorn  
And thro' the dooring peep  
There on the cricket's singing stone  
He spears the bird in fire  
And hums in sad, sweet undertone  
The song of his desire

I don't need much, got you to thank  
  
And don't you know I want you?, maybe  
Baby  
  
Oh, get your motor running  
Can't you hear me coming?  
And send it to me, ah  
Put it in a letter  
If that'll make it better  
And send it to me, haa  
Stick it in a bottle  
It's always getting hotter  
Send it to me, haa  
Nothing gonna stop it  
So shoot it like a rocket  
And send it to me, ahh  
  
Deep in the night, I turn around  
And wish you were here with me  
I grab the sheets and make up a fantasy  
Can't you see  
That you're the one that I love?  
  
Get your motor running  
Can't you hear me coming?  
And send it to me, ooh, oh, oh  
Stick it in a bottle  
Ain't nothing gonna stop it  
So shoot it like a rocket  
Baby, send it to me  
Ahh, oh  
Get your motor running  
Can't you hear me coming?  
And sent it to me, ah, ho

"Such a silly, silly, silly, silly fool am I  
Oh, I, just a silly, silly, silly, silly fool am I  
  
Hey, I should have never fallen  
Back in love with you  
Knowin' how you get a pleasure  
Breaking my poor heart in two  
You made it sound so convincin'  
When you said  
""I'm your woman, you're my man""  
Now I really need you  
And I sit here a loser again  
  
I guess I'm just a silly, silly, silly, silly fool am I, oh I  
I'm such a silly, silly, silly, silly, fool am I, mmm  
  
I should have never trusted  
In my heart to lead the way  
Now my mind is all busted  
That's a fool's price to pay  
  
You made it sound so convincin'  
When you said you'd never, never go away  
I should have never listened  
To anything you had to say  
  
I'm such a silly, silly, silly, silly, silly, silly fool am I, yes I am  
I'm such a silly, silly, silly, silly fool am I, oh  
Such a silly, silly, dilly, silly, dilly fool am I, oh yeah  
I'm such a silly, silly, silly, silly, silly fool am I, oh yes I am  
I'm such a silly, silly, dilly, silly, dilly, silly fool am I, oh yeah  
I'm such a silly, dilly, silly, dilly, silly fool am I, oh  
Silly, dilly
