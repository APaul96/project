"What do you say to the dead  
Will you forgive me for living  
Can't believe the things that they said  
Wonderful day for a killing  
It's killing me  
  
What do they do with your soul  
Is it just lying there busted  
When did you lose all control  
Is there someone to be trusted  
With my mind  
  
Oh there's insufficient evidence  
Of what just might come after  
But sometimes out of nowhere  
There's demented sounds of laughter  
  
Are we all haunted by  
The ghost - imagination  
It just can't be  
I've seen them there  
Howling at the moon  
  
Is it just me  
Or does somebody else believe this  
Well I'm not alone  
And I'm not afraid  
There's just one way to see  
  
Chorus:  
After all etc.  
  
What do you say to the dead  
Is there a place where it's burning  
It says in a book I once read  
Yes there's a chance of returning  
Turn to me  
  
The fundamental principles  
Say nothing of forever  
But those are voices that I hear  
Or I'm just not so clever  
  
It can't be me  
I know somebody else believes this  
Well I'm not alone  
I'm not afraid  
Just one way to see

"Have you ever thought about your soul - can it be saved?  
Or perhaps you think that when you're dead you just stay in your grave  
Is God just a thought within your head or is he a part of you?  
Is Christ just a name that you read in a book when you were in school?  
  
When you think about death do you lose your breath or do you keep your cool?  
Would you like to see the Pope on the end of a rope - do you think he's a
fool?  
Well I have seen the truth, yes I've seen the light and I've changed my ways  
And I'll be prepared when you're lonely and scared at the end of our days  
  
Could it be you're afraid of what your friends might say  
If they knew you believe in God above?  
They should realize before they criticize  
that God is the only way to love  
  
Is your mind so small that you have to fall  
In with the pack wherever they run  
Will you still sneer when death is near  
And say they may as well worship the sun?  
  
I think it was true it was people like you that crucified Christ  
I think it is sad the opinion you had was the only one voiced  
Will you be so sure when your day is near, say you don't believe?  
You had the chance but you turned it down, now you can't retrieve  
  
Perhaps you'll think before you say that God is dead and gone  
Open your eyes, just realize that he's the one  
The only one who can save you now from all this sin and hate  
Or will you still jeer at all you hear? Yes! I think it's too late.

A shot is fired somewhere another war begins

Somewhere there's someone dying  
In a foreign land  
Meanwhile the world is crying stupidity of man

The minds of the men who are on their way home  
  
I'm scarred for life  
But it's not my flesh that's wounded  
So how can I face the torment alone  
The vivid scenes and all the recurring nightmares  
I lay there and sweat until it gets light  
  
People say 'don't worry'  
Say that time's a perfect healer  
That the nightmares they will come to pass  
Can't hear what they're saying  
I am living in my own world  
And I'm feeling trance-like all the time  
  
I hear voices in my head  
Could I really be going crazy  
In the night the visions seem so real  
Do you care if you live or die  
When you laugh are you really crying  
You're not sure what's real anymore  
  
Fortunes of war  
Fortunes of war  
Fortunes of war  
No pain anymore  
  
Sometimes I wake  
I feel that my spirit's broken  
I wonder if I've the strength

Take a step and you will see

"I feel the breeze on my face in expectance  
Not very long before the storm reaches here  
Off in the distance the lightning is flashing again  
Feel something strong as the power draws near  
  
Is it the rolling of thunder that scares you  
Is it the crashing of clouds that hold fear  
But all I know as I sit in a corner alone  
It takes me back to my childhood again  
  
And as I wait and I look for an answer  
To all the things going round in my head  
I ask myself could it be a disaster and when  
It's maybe threatening to happen again  
  
As the ominous light draws near  
There's a lone dog howls in the park  
All the people hurry inside  
As a lightning flash lights dark  
The storm is nearly here  
Only God will know  
  
You're sitting alone you watch  
As the wind is blowing treetops  
And the swaying rustling leaves  
Plenty of time to perceive  
As you wait for rain to fall  
Only God knows  
The whole sky glows  
  
Maybe lightning strikes twice  
Maybe lightning strikes twice

In rooms of ugliness and cold  
Memories locked away  
All the doubts and fears I never faced

Deepest cut of all from you  
Knife of the truth  
Blade of hatred slicing through

Maybe this time I won't wake  
Weakness I hide so well  
This dagger in my mind will tell

Infernal sacrifice of hell

Revenge is living in the past  
Time to look into a new millennium

Shadow on us all

Their lives were meant to last  
Use yours wisely as the light is fading fast  
Free your soul and let it fly

Time returns again to punish all of us

We are strangers in this lonely promised land  
We are the shadows of the one unholy ghost  
In our nightmare world the only one we trust

Living on edge it makes feel as one  
Who cares now what's right or wrong,  
It's reality  
Killing so we survive  
Wherever we may roam  
Wherever we may hide  
We've got to get away  
  
I don't want existence to end  
We must prepare ourselves for the elements  
I just want to feel like we're strong  
We don't need a code of morality  
  
I like all the mixed emotion and anger  
It brings out the animal the power you can feel  
And feeling so high on this much adrenalin  
Excited but scary to believe what we've become

Something within us  
We are lord of flies  
  
Saints and sinners  
Something willing us  
To be lord of the flies

Rust your bullets with his tears

Smell the fear and the feeling of dread  
Soon be time to go over the wall  
Rapid fire and the end of us all  
  
Whistles, shouts and more gun fire  
Lifeless bodies hang on barbed wire  
Battlefield nothing but a bloody tomb  
Be reunited with my dead friends soon  
  
Many soldiers eighteen years  
Drown in mud, no more tears  
Surely a war no-one can win  
Killing time about to begin

From the war, a chance to live again  
Home, far away  
But the war, no chance to live again

Terror of the men we kill  
The human heart is hungry still

Nervous wait for the whistle to blow  
Rush of blood and over we go  
  
Blood is falling like the rain  
Its crimson cloak unveils again  
The sound of guns can't hide their shame  
And so we die on Paschendale  
  
Dodging shrapnel and barbed wire  
Running straight at the cannon fire  
Running blind as I hold my breath  
Say a prayer symphony of death  
  
As we charge the enemy lines  
A burst of fire and we go down  
I choke a cry but no-one hears  
Fell the blood go down my throat  
  
Home, far away  
From the war, a chance to live again  
Home, far away

"On a cold October morning  
As frost lay on the ground  
Waiting to make my move  
I make no sound  
  
Waiting for the mist to cover all around  
I carefully picked my time  
Then took the wall  
  
I'm sick and tired of running  
The hunger and the pain  
A stop to look about then off again  
  
Being at the wrong place  
And the wrong time  
Suspected of a hit that was my crime  
  
I am a fugitive being hunted down  
Like game  
I am a fugitive but I've got to clear  
My name  
  
Always looking 'round me  
Forever looking back  
I'll always be a target for attack  
  
Ever moving onwards  
Always on the run  
Waiting for the sight of a loaded gun

I am a fugitive but I've got to clear  
My name

And get to clear my name  
I know that things can never  
Be the same

My innocence some day  
I've got to get them all to make them pay

All dressed in black  
That most of them  
Not coming back  
  
Sent off to the war  
To play little games  
And on their return  
Can't name no names

Brought us only holy sin  
Utter trust is a deadly thing  
  
To the prayer of holy peace  
We didn't know what was lying underneath  
So how could we be such fools  
And to think that we thought you the answer  
  
I can't begin to understand in all the lies  
But on your death bed I can see it in you eyes  
Just as clear as all the sweat upon your brow  
It really makes sense I can see it clearly now

Unaware of the consequence  
Not aware of the secrets that you kept  
  
Nothing that we could believe

Not a thing that we could foresee  
Now a sign that would tell us the outcome  
  
You had us all strung out with  
Promises of peace  
But all along you cover plan was to deceive  
Can it put to rights now only time will tell  
Your prophecies will send us all to hell as well  
  
Left to all our golden sons  
All to pick up on the peace  
You could have given all of them  
A little chance, at least  
  
Take the world to a better place  
Given them all just a little hope  
Just think what a legacy  
You know, will leave  
  
We seem destined to live in fear  
And some that would say Armageddon is near  
But where there's a life while there's hope  
That man won't self destruct  
  
Why can't we treat our fellow men  
With more respect and a shake of their hands  
But anger and loathing is rife  
The death on all sides is  
Becoming a way of life  
  
We live in an uncertain world  
Fear understanding and ignorance  
Is leading to death  
Only the corpses are left  
For vultures that prey on their bones  
  
But some are just not wanting peace  
Their whole life is death and misery  
The only thing that they know  
Fight fire with fire life is cheap  
  
But if they do stop to think  
That man is teetering right on the brink  
But do you think that they care  
They benefit from death and pain and despair

I've got to keep running and win at all costs,  
I've got to keep going, be strong,  
Must be so determined and push myself on.  
  
Run over stiles, across fields,  
Turn to look at who's on your heels,  
Way ahead of the field,  
The line is getting nearer but do  
You want the glory that goes,  
You reach the final stretch,  
Ideals are just a trace,  
You feel like throwing the race,  
It's all so futile.

Charlotte you've taken your life and you've thrown it away  
You believe that because what you're earning  
Your life's good don't you know that you're hurting

All the men that are constantly drooling  
It's no life for you stop all that screwing

"""My son ask for thyself another

(King Philip of Macedonia - 339 B.C.)  
  
Near to the east  
In a part of ancient Greece  
In an ancient land called Macedonia  
Was born a son  
To Philip of Macedon  
The legend his name was Alexander  
  
At the age of nineteen  
He became the Macedon King  
And he swore to free all of Asia Minor  
By the Aegian Sea  
In 334 B.C.  
He utterly beat the armies of Persia  
  
[Chorus]  
Alexander the Great  
His name struck fear into hearts of men  
Alexander the Great  
Became a legend 'mongst mortal men  
  
King Darius the third  
Defeated fled Persia  
The Scythians fell by the river Jaxartes  
Then Egypt fell to the Macedon King as well  
And he founded the city called Alexandria  
  
By the Tigris river  
He met King Darius again  
And crushed him again in the battle of Arbela  
Entering Babylon  
And Susa, treasures he found  
Took Persepolis the capital of Persia  
  
[Chorus]  
Alexander the Great  
His name struck fear into hearts of men  
Alexander the Great  
Became a God amongst mortal men  
  
A Phrygian King had bound a chariot yoke  
And Alexander cut the 'Gordian knot'  
And legend said that who untied the knot  
He would become the master of Asia  
  
Helonism he spread far and wide  
The Macedonian learned mind  
Their culture was a western way of life  
He paved the way for Christianity  
  
Marching on, marching on  
The battle weary marching side by side  
Alexander's army line by line  
They wouldn't follow him to India  
Tired of the combat, pain and the glory  
  
Alexander the Great  
His name struck fear into hearts of men  
Alexander the Great  
He died of fever in Babylon

Gazing up at the stars  
Not aware of a presence so near to me  
Watching my every move  
  
Feeling scared and I fell to my knees  
As something rushed me from the trees  
Took me to an unholy place  
And that is where I fell from grace  
  
Then they summoned me over to join in with them  
To the dance of the dead  
Into the circle of fire I followed them  
Into the middle I was led  
  
As if time had stopped still I was numb with fear  
But still I wanted to go  
And the blaze of the fire did no hurt upon me  
As I walked onto the coals  
  
And I felt I was in a trance  
And my spirit was lifted from me  
And if only someone had the chance  
To witness what happened to me  
  
And I danced and I pranced and I sang with them  
All had death in their eyes  
Lifeless figures they were undead all of them  
They had ascended from hell  
  
As I danced with the dead  
My free spirit was laughing and howling down at me  
Below my undead body  
Just danced the circle of dead  
  
Until the time came to reunite us both  
My spirit came back down to me  
I didn't know if I was alive or dead  
As the others all joined in with me  
  
By luck then a skirmish started  
And took the attention away from me  
When they took their gaze from me  
Was the moment that I fled  
  
I ran like hell faster than the wind  
But behind I did not glance  
One thing that I did not dare  
Was to look just straight ahead

You know you'll be prepared for it

"In a time when dinosaurs walked the earth  
When the land was swamp and caves were home  
In an age when prize possession was fire  
To search for landscapes men would roam.  
  
Then the tribes they came to steal their fire  
And the wolves they howled into the night  
As they fought a vicious angry battle  
To save the power of warmth and light.  
  
Drawn by quest for fire  
They searched all through the land  
Drawn by quest for fire  
Discovery of man.  
  
And they thought that when the embers died away  
That the flame of life had burnt and died  
Didn't know the sparks that made the fire  
Were made by rubbing stick and stone.  
  
So they ploughed through the forest and swamps of danger  
And they fought the cannibal tribes and beasts  
In the search to find another fire  
To regain the power of light and heat.  
  
Drawn by quest for fire  
They searched across the land  
Drawn by quest for fire  
Discovery of man.

"Hear the rime of the ancient mariner  
See his eye as he stops one of three  
Mesmerizes one of the wedding guests  
Stay here and listen to the nightmares of the sea.  
  
And the music plays on, as the bride passes by  
Caught by his spell and the mariner tells his tale.  
  
Driven south to the land of the snow and ice  
To a place where nobody's been  
Through the snow fog flies on the albatross  
Hailed in God's name, hoping good luck it brings.  
  
And the ship sails on, back to the North  
Through the fog and ice and the albatross follows on.  
  
The mariner kills the bird of good omen  
His shipmates cry against what he's done  
But when the fog clears, they justify him  
And make themselves a part of the crime.  
  
Sailing on and on and north across the sea  
Sailing on and on and north 'til all is calm.  
  
The albatross begins with it's vengeance  
A terrible curse a thirst has begun  
His shipmates blame bad luck on the mariner  
About his neck, the dead bird is hung.  
  
And the curse goes on and on at sea  
And the curse goes on and on for them and me.  
  
""Day after day, day after day,  
We stuck nor breath nor motion  
As idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean  
Water, water everywhere and  
All the boards did shrink  
Water, water everywhere nor any drop to drink.""  
  
There calls the mariner  
There comes a ship over the line  
But how can she sail with no wind in her sails and no tide?  
  
She... onward she comes  
Onward she nears out of the sun  
See, she has no crew  
She has no life, wait but here's two.  
  
Death and she life in death,  
They throw their dice for the crew  
She wins the mariner and he belongs to her now.  
Then, crew one by one  
They drop down dead, two hundred men  
She, she, Life in Death.  
She lets him live, her chosen one.  
  
""One after one by the star dogged moon,  
Too quick for groan or sigh  
Each turned his face with a ghastly pang  
And cursed me with his eye  
Four times fifty living men  
(And I heard nor sigh nor groan)  
With heavy thump, a lifeless lump,  
They dropped down one by one.""  
  
The curse it lives on in their eyes  
The mariner he wished he'd die  
Along with the sea creatures  
But they lived on, so did he.  
  
And by the light of the moon  
He prays for their beauty not doom  
With heart he blesses them  
God's creatures all of them too.  
  
Then the spell starts to break  
The albatross falls from his neck  
Sinks down like lead into the sea  
Then down in falls comes the rain.  
  
Hear the groans of the long dead seamen  
See them stir and they start to rise  
Bodies lifted by good spirits  
None of them speak and they're lifeless in their eyes  
  
And revenge is still sought, penance starts again  
Cast into a trance and the nightmare carries on.  
  
Now the curse is finally lifted  
And the mariner sights his home  
Spirits go from the long dead bodies  
Form their own light and the mariner's left alone.  
  
And then a boat came sailing towards him  
It was a joy he could not believe  
The pilot's boat, his son and the hermit,  
Penance of life will fall onto him.  
  
And the ship it sinks like lead into the sea  
And the hermit shrives the mariner of his sins.  
  
The mariner's bound to tell of his story  
To tell this tale wherever he goes  
To teach God's word by his own example  
That we must love all things that God made.  
  
And the wedding guest's a sad and wiser man  
And the tale goes on and on and on.

Way back up in the woods amongst the evergreens  
There stood an old cabin made of earth and wood

That never ever learned to read and write so well  
But he could play a guitar just like ringing a bell

The people passing by would stop and say  
""Oh my but how that little country boy could play""

His mother told him some day you will be a man  
And you will be the leader of a big old band  
Many people coming from miles around  
To hear you play your music till the sun goes down  
Maybe someday your name will be in lights, saying  
Johnny B. Goode tonight

"Standing by my window, breathing summer breeze  
Saw a figure floating, 'neath the willow tree  
Asked us if we were happy, we said we didn't know  
Took us by the hands and up we go  
  
We followed the dreamer through the purple hazy clouds  
He could control our sense of time  
We thought we were lost but no matter how we tried  
Everyone was in peace of mind  
  
We felt the sensations drift inside our frames  
Finding complete contentment there  
And all the tensions that hurt us in the past  
Just seemed to vanish in thin air  
  
He said in the cosmos is a single sonic sound  
That is vibrating constantly  
And if we could grip and hold on to the note  
We would see our minds were free...oh they're free  
  
We are lost above  
Floating way up high  
If you think you can find a way  
You can surely try

One or two crack up and start to cry  
Selfishness breeds in this cesspool of sorrow

Synchronized watches flash in the sunlight  
As into the battle we are all led

Maiming, destroying, every single day

Slaying, waylaying, in the heat of the midday sun

You wouldn't lay a finger on your mother, oh no  
You never ever dream to hurt her

"Sitting in the cellar, watching all the others  
  
It was only yesterday, needles in my skin  
They turned my last remains into this puppet thing  
  
Blood to walk, blood to see  
Blood to walk again and blood to be  
  
I can see, but I cannot move at all  
Yet I have feelings, I know it's very strange  
  
Blood to walk, blood to see  
Blood to walk again and blood to be  
  
I'm on my shelf...eternal eyes they never sleep  
I take a look...and in the dark I see victoria

There is no mistake, that is my beloved  
Sitting on her shelf.. alone and so dead

There's a light outside the door  
Mommy and daddy are back for more.. ""let's play""  
  
""Hello my children...in blood I will teach you""  
  
They take Victoria down from her shelf  
They sit her on the floor.. and me in front of her  
  
Blood to walk, blood to see  
Blood to walk again and blood to be  
  
There are strings attached to our heads  
There are strings in arms and legs  
The puppet master""s hands  
Oh they keep us straight  
  
Pressing the needle in... I feel the sting, it's emerencia  
Injecting blood... into the both of us...it's hot  
  
I think I see her move  
There's a tingle in our skin  
I can't believe...that she can she again...  
  
There is no mistake, that is my beloved  
I have missed you so.. oh no  
It's like a horror show without a word we know  
As we communicate.. with our eyes.. deep inside  
We wonder why  
  
Why our minds are now in our eyes  
We can move without any strings

"Tea time Monday night, I was waiting  
passing time  
Then from the hallway, I saw Mother  
in her nightgown  
Swaying up the stairs, up the stairs, it  
seemed so unreal  
I knew Grandma' had sent ""THEM""  
again, the invisible friends  
  
A little later in the middle of tea we  
came close to ecstasy  
""THEY"" were telling tales from  
beyond when Grandma' rose  
  
She opened the door, and there was  
Missy  
Seeing Mother in Grandmother's  
chair, she went into tears  
  
Missy was screaming  
""What have You done, what have you  
done to My Ma"", crying louder now  
""We better get rid of her, She's too  
young anyway"", it was Grandma' who  
spoke  
  
""Bye, bye Missy, be gone forever  
The beautiful fireplace in the kitchen  
will do""  
  
I saw Missy struggling in Grandma'  
wrinkled hands  
""Oh No, let me be, Oh No Please No  
Grandma' Please  
Aagh Grandma' You're hurting me.  
Don't touch me or I'll break it, I've got  
the tea pot, I'll do it anyway""  
I saw liquid spreading, the bloody tea  
all over the floor  
Now I heard ""THEIR"" voices, some  
kind of demon growls  
DIE - SHE BROKE AMON - AMON - DIE  
  
""THEY"" dropped ""THEIR"" tea cups,  
Grandma' stood still  
forced by invisible hands, Missy went  
down the stairs  
As I waved her goodbye, Missy was  
sobbing away  
  
Will I ever see her again, Bye bye  
Missy, don't be afraid

"Down into the dark I go, armed with just a candle and then my soul  
Cryptic messages written on the floor  
Rats are nibbling at my feet, I send one off to nevermore  
Too much darkness, spiders on my eyes  
  
Webs are hanging from my thighs, the fatter ones must die  
I see shadows walking straight and tall  
I don't know how they move, dancing on the walls  
Presence of fear, a presence so near  
  
I wonder what could be so powerful beyond the dark  
Human bones... in little chambers all along the narrow halls  
Catacomb, death over life... Catacomb, am I here to die?  
I see a light, I push some bones aside  
  
Down into the dark I go, another chamber, a chamber with a glow  
Could this be a doorway to another world?  
Or darkness playing tricks, with my little mind?  
The virgin Mary is standing tall  
  
A full size figure carved in wood up against the wall  
Her face is peeling from all the years gone by  
Is it just a statue, or is it what I'm looking for?  
I break her face and see another one instead  
  
The mummy's face appears as the bandages they fall  
Dried out face with hate upon me gaze  
How grotesque... the mummy wears a crown of thorns  
From the empty sockets where its eyes should be  
  
An entity of light is pouring out towards me  
And then the sound... Jesus Christ,what have they done to you?  
I'm running for my life, I'm running from the night  
But it's so hard to breathe, the stench down here is much too much  
  
Satan help me, help me God  
Help me anyone, anyone who hears my cry of fear  
Cold winds from far beyond the dark  
Chasing through the catacomb and breathing down my neck  
  
Human bones... in little chambers all along the narrow halls  
Catacomb, death over life... Catacomb, am I here to die?  
I know I'm here to die

"The morning slowly came, my life about to end  
Then the wind would change, all but one had left  
The angelic wolf had stayed, without a word she said  
Follow me, follow the wolf  
  
And so I followed the wolf, up the wooded mountain side  
Close to the top... she suddenly stopped  
Sun to the East, man and beast  
Just two silhouettes... in a landscape never to forget  
  
Like dark decaying teeth, I saw the village beneath  
A few and distant roads all leading away from here  
Nobody in the streets... decay  
I must follow the wolf again, I must follow her till the end  
  
The end  
The Wolf had turned around, facing higher ground  
And there it was... The House of God  
In awe I looked as time had stopped  
  
Follow me  
I had never seen a church like this before  
""This Place is terrible"" inscribed above the door  
Like dark decaying teeth, I saw the church within  
  
A few distant thoughts, inviting me in to sin  
Nobody in the church... decay  
Shrouded in a gloomy light, as if my final night  
I wonder if God was ever here

Nothing but falling on slippery stairs  
Falling and crying, crawling and dying  
At the end of the stairs

Hating him more with every thrust

Later that Night in her Room, Abigail was drifting off to sleep.  
All of what she had seen Today, was hard to believe.  
  
Then the screams of a child in pain, creeping deep into her brain  
Then the screams of a child in pain, she cannot find her mommy  
And that's a shame  
  
Abigail was quickly on her feet  
Down the stairs and into the dark, Abigail was following the sound  
And there she was: the child  
  
It was clearly a ghost, the ghost from the gate in the storm  
""Little girl, tell me who you are?""  
""I am your spirit twin from years ago, I'm little one""  
  
That brought back memories of Abigail when turning six  
Sneaking out of bed, like she always did  
  
Hiding in the dark, listening to the men  
Tell their stories from way back then  
She remembered the story of Jonathan  
  
And they'd been talking about the Little One  
  
Then the screams of a child in pain, creeping deep into her brain  
Then the screams of a child in pain, she cannot find her mommy

"Above the wreckage of your mortal world I stand  
Judgement passed delivered by his hand  
Now clear the smoke, there the ashes stand  
A fitting tribute to mortality and man.  
What was written foretold in dreams,  
In visions apocalypse now seen.  
And all self-righteous fools who lived and blasphemed  
Drink the wine of his anger  
Die with the beast.  
  
Vindication, he is coming on the clouds.  
See his angels, hear their trumpets sound.  
The day of anger when the stars fall from the sky  
The moon turns red, the sun turns black as night.  
Know the end is coming, heed this sign  
By the morning star the four horsemen ride.  
  
Revelation, the chosen saved  
Earth be cleansed in a blaze.  
Armageddon, the first trumpet blows  
Hail, fire and blood fall on satans throne.  
  
His hair as white as wool, his eyes like burning flame  
He is the first and last, he brings the seven plagues.  
Seven stars of seven cities in his hand  
He holds the keys of death for the underworld and man.  
Know the end is coming, heed this sign

Hector's body dragged three times around  
I will carry the torch to your funeral Pyre  
I will ask of the wind to send high your fire

I lust.

Where the blood of my enemy lies.  
  
Three sons have I, and they  
Ride by my side. The fierce,  
The black, and the wicked are  
Their names we ride down my  
Enemies on their half-hearted flight.  
No voice of mercy no angels of light.

Forsaken and man has never seen are the

"He broke the laws of the elders  
So they plucked out his eye,  
Took his land and fortune,  
Left him to die  
  
Bound on the shoreline,  
Left for the tide,  
Sees his life blood leaving...  
Circling lower the vultures fly  
  
These bones may be broken  
But the spirit can't die  
And the Gods see his anguish  
And give him a sign  
  
From the floor of the ocean  
The ship of the lost souls rise  
And they take him where no one sleeps  
while the undead cry  
Where no one sleeps while the undead cry  
  
And in the world above  
The elders sing,  
On his land they live  
Let death's bell ring  
  
He was met at the gate of Hades  
By the Guardian of the Lost Souls,  
The Keeper of the Unavenged  
And He did say to him:  
""Let ye not pass Abaddon, return to the world from whence you came  
And seek payment not only for thine own anguish  
But vindicate the souls of the unavenged""  
  
And they placed in his hands a sword made for him called Vengeance  
Forged in brimstone and tempered by the woeful tears of the unavenged  
  
And to carry him on his journey back to the upper world  
They brought forth their demon horse called Black Death  
A grim steed so fearsome in might and black in color  
That he could stand as one with the darkness  
Save for his burning eyes of crimson fire  
  
And on that night they rode up from Hell  
The pounding of his hooves did clap like thunder  
  
Burning, death, destruction raping the daughters and wives  
In blood I take my payment in full with their lives  
  
No one can escape me on Black Death I ride  
When kissed by the sword of Vengeance  
Your head lays there by your side  
I take the lives of all that I once knew  
The torn flesh of a slow death waits for you  
  
Burning, death, destruction raping the daughters and wives  
In blood I take my payment in full with their lives  
  
I spare not land or servants my wake is smoke and flame  
I take their wives and daughters  
They stand there watching, watching  
Hoping to gain their livese but when I'm through they know they must pay

Give us your word for the grand final stand

Be good to the children and old people first

He paid with his life  
For his life was the price

Thy journey begins  
With sword in the wind  
Stay thy hand rest thy command  
For odin's call was heard above them all  
Thy name shall never die!  
Long shall we remember  
He who walked the road of danger  
Master of revenge  
Death's no stranger  
Blood and death lived on his sword  
The god of war his only lord  
Into the depths of hell  
Go all he fell  
Take thy shield take thy sword  
All thy weapons to the sky  
Ye shall need them when odin bid thee rise  
For none but the brave  
Shall rise up from the grave  
To see the valkyries fly  
And so it was by the hand of odin  
Did the immortal warrior pass through  
The gates of valhalla and into legend.  
Rise brother rise pass valhalla's gates  
Here great warriors await  
Reborn from thy steel  
All thy wounds be healed  
From the earth to the sky  
Now the son of odin rise!  
Take thy place among the kings  
For thy soul shall never die!

Kill me if you can.

"Grand father, tell me a story!  
All right, go and get your storybook  
No, no, not one of those, a real story  
A real story?  
Yes! Tell me about when you were a boy  
Well, then, I shall have to take you back with me  
A long way in time  
It was my thirteenth year on a cold winter's day  
As I walked through the enchanted forest  
I heard the sounds of horses and men at arms  
I felt compelled to walk on and find the place of these sounds  
And when the forest did clear I was standing on a hill  
Before me there was a great plane  
Upon it the armies of the world,standing, waiting  
I thought to myself, for whom or for what are they waiting?  
Suddenly a gust of wind come up from the north  
There appeared a lone rider, holding a sword of steel  
Then from the south came another, bearing a battle axe  
From the east came a third, holding a spiked club  
And finally, from the west a rider  
Who wielded a great hammer of war, with them came their  
Soldiers of death, followed by an army of immortals  
They were few in number  
But the look in their eyes told all who beheld them  
That they would leave this day only in victory or death  
And there was a great silence  
My heart began to pound, storm clouds filled the sky with darkness  
Rain came and four winds blew with such anger  
That I held fast to a tree  
I watched the four riders raise their weapons into the air  
Without warning, screaming their war cry they led the attack  
Down to the battle they rode  
They met the armies of the world with a mighty clash  
I could feel the groundshake, the earth drank much blood that day  
Each of the four, was into himself a whirlwind of doom  
When the smoke did clear, many thousands were dead  
There was much blood and gore  
Their bodies lay broken and scattered across the battle field  
Like brown leaves blown by the wind  
And I saw the four ride together to the top of the hill  
While below them the soldiers of death assembled  
All those who would now swear allegiance to them  
And the four spoke the words of the warriors prayer  
Gods of war I call you, my sword is by my side  
I seek a life of honor free from all false pride  
I will crack the whip with a bold mighty hail  
Cover me with death if I should ever fail  
Glory, majesty, unity, hail, hail,hail  
And as I stood and looked on, I heard the armies of the world  
Hail them without end, and their voices of victory  
Carried long and far throughout the land  
Well, That's it, did you like the story?  
Yeah, it was great!  
Oh, good, I'm glad, now off to bed with you

Yes?

Who were they? They were the Metal Kings

"There are places I'll remember

Some forever not for better  
Some have gone and some remain  
All these places have their moments  
With lovers and friends I still can recall  
Some are dead and some are living

But of all these friends and lovers  
There is no one compares with you  
And these memories lose their meaning

For people and things that went before  
I know I'll often stop and think about them  
In my life I love you more

Watch it count down to the end of the days

But didn't evn know  
I wasted it all just to watch you go..  
I kept everything inside  
And even though I tried, It all fell apart  
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when  
  
I tried so hard, and got so far, but in the end it doesn't even matter,  
I had to fall, to lose it all, but in the end, it doesn't even matter...

I don't know why  
It doesn't even matter how hard you try

To remind myself how i tried so hard  
In spite of the way you were mocking me  
Acting like I was part of your property  
Remembering all the times you fought with me  
I'm surprised it got so far  
Things aren't the way they were before  
You wouldn't even reckognize me anymore  
Not that you knew me back then  
But it all comes back to me in the end  
I kept everything inside and even though I tried, it all fell apart  
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when  
  
I tried so hard, and got so far, but in the end it doesn't even matter,  
I had to fall, to lose it all, but in the end, it doesn't even matter...

Pushed as far as I could go  
For all this, there's only one thing you should know...(2x)

'Cause You are so much more than me  
Above me - beyond me  
So far over my head but I still see You  
And I am finally making sense of it all  
As the wisdom of this fool begins to fall, fall, fall  
Down  
The story of my soul seems like a broken road  
And how I'm standing here is unbelievable  
Keep me lost in the mystery - down here on my knees  
The only way that I can reach what seems unreachable  
I want to believe  
Without a single question  
Oh Lord hear my confession  
Chorus

"He looked through temples of time  
To see you right where you stand  
He emptied all of himself  
So he could reach out his hand  
To give hope and meaning  
To the wasted away  
And you are one of the ones  
That he was dying to save  
  
[Chorus:]  
He was dying to reach you  
Trying to meet you  
Where you need him most  
You've been living in search of  
The whole truth and real love  
Your whole life through  
You can open your heart  
'Cause he's dying to reach you  
  
He's standing there at the door  
You can hear him call you by name  
He simply waits to forgive  
All of the guilt and the shame  
He gave up his own life  
And he still bears the scars  
He only wants to receive you  
So come as you are  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Oh, he has waited time and time before  
You must be still and know that he is lord

We're sheltered from the raging river's roar

Though the night is long

Still God is with us  
We can stem the tide  
Reach the other side  
For God is with us  
The river deepens, night grows darker  
And the struggle seems to be getting harder  
Today has troubles yesterday has never known  
But we don't have to face them on our own

"Spinning around on the tops of his feet  
Smiles of the angels could not be so sweet  
Wide blue eyes

She's her daddys' girl  
'Cause he knows the jokes that always make her laugh  
He takes her for ice cream instead of her nap

There's nothin' better than bein' your girl  
And if I am your princess than daddy

To think not so long ago that fase was mine  
Houses get smaller we take different names  
But some things in life stay the same

There's nothin' better than bein' your girl  
And if I am your princess than daddy

'Cause some day she'll go off and find a life of her own  
Marry a good man  
And make a happy home  
Until she comes back and sees with those same eyes  
What time can not diskise  
  
She walks through the door with that look on her face  
Cause daddys' brown hair has all turned to gray  
They talk for hours they cry and they laugh  
Watchin' old movies and thinkin' back  
And just as she turns to go  
She says, ""hey dad, how bout 1 for the road""  
  
""Dance me! Dance me around till my feet don't ever touch DOWN!  
  
""Dance me! Dance me around till my feet don't ever touch down

"Mitchell parish, leroy anderson 1948  
  
Just hear those sleigh bells jingling,  
Ring ting tingling too  
Come on, it's lovely weather  
For a sleigh ride together with you,  
Outside the snow is falling  
And friends are calling ""yoo hoo,""  
Come on, it's lovely weather  
For a sleigh ride together with you.  
  
Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap,  
Let's go, let's look at the show,  
We're riding in a wonderland of snow.  
Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap,  
It's grand, just holding your hand,  
We're gliding along with a song  
Of a wintry fairy land.  
  
Our cheeks are nice and rosy  
And comfy cozy are we  
We're snuggled up together  
Like two birds of a feather would be  
Let's take that road before us  
And sing a chorus or two  
Come on, it's lovely weather  
For a sleigh ride together with you.  
  
There's a birthday party  
At the home of farmer gray  
It'll be the perfect ending a perfect day  
We'll be singing the songs  
We love to sing without a single stop,  
At the fireplace while we watch  
The chestnuts pop. Pop! Pop! Pop!  
  
There's a happy feeling  
Nothing in the world can buy,  
When they pass around the chocolate  
And the pumpkin pie  
It'll nearly be like a picture print  
By currier and ives  
These wonderful things are the things  
We remember all through our lives!  
  
Just hear those sleigh bells jingling,  
Ring ting tingling too  
Come on, it's lovely weather  
For a sleigh ride together with you,  
Outside the snow is falling  
And friends are calling ""yoo hoo,""  
Come on, it's lovely weather  
For a sleigh ride together with you.

It makes me happy  
Always makes me feel free

Not trying to sell you

Is that Jesus will be true  
He's there to comfort you  
You're not the only one  
Who feels like everything you've done  
Is measured in pain  
Come in from the rain  
There's no reason to run from the One  
Who can free you oh yeah

Too young to know what is meant for his life

"When you're living for the love of  
A lifetime  
You wonder if the waiting will ever end  
And the right from the wrong  
That you've guarded so long  
Is closer that it's ever been  
But sometimes a moment of weakness  
Can sacrifice the treasure of time  
And cause you to miss the miracle  
That god longs for you to find  
  
[Chorus]  
There's a love he has for you  
There's a heart that he's been saving  
There's a joy beyond all measure  
That only comes from waiting  
There's a love he has for you  
It's more than the hope you're holding to  
And you will find the only love that's true  
Is the love he has for you  
  
When you're torn between today  
And tomorrow  
And holding out for something you  
Cannot see  
There's a strength you can find  
Knowing in god's own time  
You'll discover what he meant to be  
'Cause love like the father intended  
Is more than just a state of the heart  
So don't give up hope in the holding on  
'Cause no matter who you are

"God's passion is an endless river  
White water running wild  
In a restless rushing fury  
To see souls reconciled.  
It reaches wide across forever  
It's dangerous and deep  
And while some venture to the shoreline  
Some even dare to leap  
Chorus:  
And The River rages, The River runs  
All through the ages, Long after I'm gone  
There's a truth I'm finding I can't ignore  
Whether I dive in or stand on the shore  
The River keeps rushing on.  
All of those who ride the rapids  
Have a message they must tell  
There's a joy in being lost in something  
That's bigger than yourself  
And though the current takes you places  
Where you learn to lose control  
If you think you're going under  
He'll never let you go, never let you go

Calling us home, drawing us in

It'll change the world around us if we listen  
It's the living, breathing message  
Of the mercy of our god

It's pushing down walls, driving out doubt  
No power on earth's gonna drown it out

And the music plays on  
When we start to sing the song  
No nothing's gonna stop the faithful love of jesus  
It's the living, breathing message  
Of the mercy of our god

Welling up in us, a love beyond compare  
Spilling from the lips of the believers everywhere

"What do you say to someone who feels like they've lost it all  
Over the edge with no one there to break their fall  
And what do you say to someone who feels so unloved  
Giving themselves away a little bit every day just to be good enough  
And what do you say to a hopeless soul who can't remember their way home  
And everything is out of their control  
  
Chorus:  
There is no valley, there is no darkness  
There is no sorrow greater than the grace of Jesus.  
There is no moment, there is no distance,  
There is no heartbreak He can't take you through.  
So before you think that you're too lost to save,  
Remember there is nothing greater than grace.  
  
What do you say to someone whose life is on the line  
And they're unsure what happens after their last breath in time  
What do you say to someone whose built a wall you can't break through  
And it's so hard for them to hear the truth  
  
There is no valley, there is no darkness  
There is no sorrow greater than the grace of Jesus.  
There is no moment, there is no distance,  
There is no heartbreak He can't take you through.  
So before you think that you're too lost to save,  
Remember there is nothing greater than grace.  
  
So don't lose hope, don't let go  
Don't give up, you are not alone  
  
There is no valley, there is no darkness  
There is no sorrow greater than the grace of Jesus.  
There is no moment, there is no distance,  
There is no heartbreak He can't take you through.  
So before you think that you're too lost to save,  
So before you think that you're too lost to save,  
Remember there is nothing greater than grace.

"Hearts of hope seem hard to find these days  
As darker deeds have their time on center stage  
We watch it all unfolding scene by scene  
And a happy ending seems a fading dream  
Fear and desperation have their day  
At least until faith steps up to say  
I believe, though God is out of sight  
He's working in the middle of all things  
Evil may have Its time in the spotlight  
But love is waiting in the wings  
Love is always waiting in the wings  
It?s your life, as it plays out don't forget it  
Heartache comes but the stories not done yet  
Oh, when shadows come, your courage wants to fade  
Oh but in a moment, everything can change  
I believe, though God is out of sight  
He's working in the middle of all things  
Evil may have Its time in the spotlight  
Oh, but love is waiting in the wings  
Love is always waiting in the wings  
there's always more to any story  
Than just what's here and now  
There's not one hopeless situation  
That can't be turned around  
I believe, though God is out of sight  
He's working in the middle of all things, oh  
Evil may have Its time in the spotlight  
Oh, but love is waiting in the wings  
Love is always waiting in the wings  
Love is always waiting in the wings

Wasn't long 'till I called mamma, I wouldn't wanna call no one else  
And I knew exactly what she'd say

What about Jesus? What about Jesus?

'Cause it's a long road, if you're walking it alone  
Without Jesus, Jesus  
  
We said goodbye and I went out driving  
Running like I always do  
Until I found that lonely back road  
That wooden cross where I lost you  
And I swore I'd never pray again  
But mama's words were running through my head  
  
I've asked so many questions  
Since my world came crashing down  
But the one that really matters  
Just keeps on ringing out, over every doubt  
  
What about Jesus? What about Jesus?

Whom shepherds guard and angels sing:  
Haste, haste to bring him laud,

Come peasant king to own Him,

What I deserve  
I often miss the chance to show my  
Faith in Him

How Jesus ever finds a way to intercede

What's He gonna say about me  
When He weighs the works that  
I have done  
Against the words that I have  
Failed to speak  
What's He gonna say about me  
When the chaff is sifted from the wheat  
Will there be evidence that I believed  
What's He gonna say about me  
  
After this lifetime will come  
The thankfulness that I forget  
I will regret when I see clearly who He is  
Then I'll know all I should have said  
So I must choose to not neglect  
But resurrect the praise for all He is to me  
I often miss the chance to show my faith in Him  
By failing to convey what I have seen  
And then I wonder while I face eternity  
How Jesus ever finds a way to intercede

Under the spell of darkness or light  
We are proven now fortune rides on our side.

Endless night

It ain't love, no, it's just lust  
Cause tonight I'm the wicked one  
Gimme love, wicked love  
The naked child I'm fantasizing of  
It ain't love, no, it's just lust  
Cause tonight all I want's your wicked love

"A thousand years I've roamed the plains  
And waved the hand of doom  
I've seen the tears that fall  
Like rain from the waste and all that ruin  
A shadow's cast from me to you  
A time to claim  
All that's mine, my wrath is blind  
The balance is where you hang  
  
I'm the WidowMaker  
I'm the Lord of the Wings  
I'm the WidowMaker  
  
The cries of sadness never heard  
Fall deaf upon my ears  
The stench of madness, raging wars  
I've seen a million years  
The smell of sorrow fills the fields  
And lingers in the sky  
The littered ground will swallow down  
The souls that fill my eyes  
  
I'm the WidowMaker  
I'm the Lord of the Wings  
I'm the WidowMaker  
  
I'm the WidowMaker  
I'm the Lord of the Wings  
I'm the WidowMaker  
  
I'm the WidowMaker  
I'm the Lord of the Wings  
I'm the WidowMaker

"I ride, I ride the winds that bring the rain  
A creature of love and can't be tamed  
I want you, cause I'm gonna take your love from him  
And I'll touch your face and hot burning skin  
No, he'll never ever touch you like I do  
So look in my eyes and burn alive the truth  
  
I'm a wild child, come and love me  
I want you  
My heart's in exile I need you to touch me  
Cause I want what you do  
I'm a wild child, come and love me  
I want you  
My heart's in exile I need you to touch me  
Cause I want what you do  
I want you  
  
Tell me, tell me the lies you're telling him when you  
Run away 'cause I want to know  
Cause I, I'm sure it's killing him to find  
That you run to me when he let's you go  
Cause I'm burning, burning, burning up with fire  
So come turn me on and turn the flames up higher  
  
I'm a wild child, come and love me  
I want you  
My heart's in exile I need you to touch me  
Cause I want what you do  
  
I'm a wild child, come and love me  
I want you  
My heart's in exile I need you to touch me  
Cause I want what you do  
I want you  
  
A naked hit machine, I want your love  
When the moons arise we'll feel just what it does  
  
I'm a wild child, come and love me  
I want you  
My heart's in exile I need you to touch me  
Cause I want what you do  
I'm a wild child, come and love me  
I want you  
My heart's in exile I need you to touch me  
I want you  
My heart's in exile I need you to touch me  
Cause I want what you do  
I want you

"[Jesse to Self]  
  
There's place where I'm  
Oh - with sorrowed lives  
And all the souls  
Oh - they're wishing they could die  
  
Take me down  
And drown this the orphan forever  
Ya know I do  
Wish away the pain  
And wash away my life  
Find me down inside a shallow pool  
Down a wishing well  
No more bleeding  
No more screaming tonight  
  
Wash away my pain  
Oh - in the well of sighs  
For I have no face - oh  
Abandoned for all, for all time  
  
[Jesse thinking of his mother]  
  
Why, why am I nothing?  
Oh mamma why, why'd you leave me  
A throw away for life  
Oh - oh why, why am I nothing  
Oh and mamma why  
Can you feel me there  
Oh God I want to die

"
"[Judah to Jesse]  
  
You'll be so far out of control  
You'll be out of your mind  
You'll feel nothing, it's taking a hold of you  
Won't ya leave all your pain behind  
  
XTC Riders , Riders out of control  
Get you higher, higher

XTC Riders , Riders  
Ain't never going home  
Oh, just let it ride  
  
You'll feel my X is taking control  
You'll be numb and blind  
Come kneel and pray for me, for a little while  
To the Neon God that's in your mind  
  
I'm your Messiah  
Dresses all in black  
Are you the chosen one  
I'll get you higher, no turning back  
My Neon Son

Riding the XTC
