The order of the Jupyter notebooks is as follows:

1. Artist_Outsourcing_and_Genre_Attribution.ipynb
2. -> Cleaning Data -> Cleaning_Data.ipynb
3. -> Analysis -> Data_Analysis_and_Classifier_Preparation.ipynb
4. -> Classification -> Logistic_Regression_Classification.ipynb

I also included several of the .csv and .txt files used in the notebooks in case you want to take a look at some of them.
However, I left out the majority of them since it would take up too much unnecessary space.
